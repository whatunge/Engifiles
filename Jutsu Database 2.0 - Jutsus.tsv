999	1	1	Body Switch Technique	Kawarimi no Jutsu	A common jutsu - used to quickly replace a body with a close by object. Creates confusing among the opponent(s) - creating a chance to escape, or return with a larger strike. Useful for avoiding attacks and hiding from potential enemies. This is a super-speed jutsu, not a teleportation one. Kawarimi may be used twice per thread.														
999	1	2	Transformation Technique	Henge no Jutsu	Using this technique, a shinobi is able to alter their appearance to look like another person. This jutsu creates a kind of chakra shell around the user, which warps light to create a semi-solid illusion. Henge allows a shinobi solely to appear like other people and mimic their voice, but nothing else. The chakra shell holding the illusion together is fragile and immediately dissipates if the user enters combat. Stage Two: The user can appear as objects, but only of similar size (ex: a crouching character appearing as a barrel). Stage Three: The chakra shell is more durable and does not break from taijutsu attacks. Ninjutsu still dissipates the henge.														
999	1	3	Magic Cloak Of Invisibility Technique	Kakuremino no Jutsu	The user can use their chakra to change the color and texture of any fabric they're wearing or touching. If caught in the forest, they might shift to hues of green to brown to blend in to the foliage around them, and in a city they might alter their clothes to better fit in among the populace. It's not foolproof, as only the user's clothing changes, but it gives the shinobi another edge to work with. 														
999	1	4	Unlocking Technique	Anrokku no Jutsu	The user directs chakra toward a target no further than one meter away that they can see or feel and infuses the object with their will, allowing them to manipulate it in subtle ways. A lock could be made to open, a knot be made to untie, a candle could be snuffed. The object is only gently influenced; a rope for example could be made to form a noose, but not to strangle and while a lock could be made to unlatch it could not be broken. Special: This jutsu may be used without handseals, but only escape from rope, handcuffs, or similar non-ninjutsu binds.														
999	1	5	Element Hand	Yoso no Te	The user performs seals, then concentrates chakra near his shoulder, pooling it together before having it swirl out from his body. The chakra flows into an arm-like shape, complete with a fully functional hand at the far end. This chakra arm can instead be composed of any element the user knows how to control fire if he knows katon, water if he knows suiton, and so on. But, if the user knows no true elemental techniques, the hand is simply hardened chakra, looking akin to colored flame. The arm only has 1/4th the Strength of the user and cannot perform handseals, but is capable of holding items and weapons. Stage Two: The user can create a pair of arms. Stage Three: The user can create three arms: one pair and an additional limb. Stage Four: The user can create two pairs of arms. 														
999	1	6	Open Slot																
999	2	1	Tree Walking / Wall Walking Technique	Kinobori/Kabenobori no Jutsu	By focusing chakra into the feet and keeping it balanced, the user can walk up against vertical objects and cling to its surface. This technique is passive and does not require any jutsu usages. Stage Three: The user may walk across water or other liquids as though they were solid surfaces.														
999	2	2	Chakra Hair Rope	Chakra Kami Nawa	Charging chakra through a lock of hair or a piece of string or wire, the user uses it as a medium through with to activate Kami Nawa. Should the wire come into contact with the skin of anyone apart from the user, the charged strand will wrap around the limb and the chakra will suffuse it through it, rendering the limb immobile until it runs out of juice. This effect lasts for one post, plus an additional post per rank the user has over the target. Stage Three: Base duration of two posts, plus an additional post per rank over.														
999	2	3	Chakra Light Technique	Chakra Hikari no Jutsu	This jutsu allows the user to make a ball of chakra that produces light enough to guide the shinobi's path. It's useful for when going in dark areas and good for letting your comrades know where you are if you get lost in a foggy place. The user can also cause the ball of chakra to flare brightly like a flash bomb to temporarily blind enemies.														
999	2	4	Sound Masking Technique	Kyou Masukingu no Jutsu	This ninjutsu helps to cover up any sounds the user makes if they are on a mission that requires stealth. Focusing chakra in a way much like walking on water, the ninja can move using this chakra as a sort of cushion, allowing them to move without rustling over leaves or stepping on twigs. Sound Masking can be applied to any and all parts of the body as necessary.

999	2	6	Open Slot																
999	3	1	Chakra Hunting Technique	Chakra Tsuitou no Jutsu	During chase procedures and otherwise, when the user has been closer to the target than thirty feet, and having had the ability to see the target clearly under those circumstances, the user can remember the target's chakra currents and distinguish these for a number of posts equal to the user's power divided by two. If the enemy uses a genjutsu, or gains a difference of more than a mile, the user will lose track of the target. 														
999	3	2	Reduced Earth	Shukuchi	Originally implemented by samurai, shinobi have learned to use chakra to perform this technique as well. By forcing chakra into the legs, the user is able to go from standstill to his highest speed instantaneously and crush the distance separating him from his opponent, seizing the element of surprise through incredible speed. The user's speed increases by two levels for two posts, and is reduced by two from base for two more in the fallout. 														
999	3	3	Hidden Explosion Technique	Hitoshizeru Bakuhatsu no Jutsu	The user claps their hands together, smoke and force immediately exploding out from them, shrouding the entire battlefield. The smoke is totally opaque to all sight, whether enhanced by shinobi arts or through technology meant to peer through it. An excellent way to either escape dogged pursuers or reposition for a counterattack, the smoke gives the user and their allies' two posts following its creation to prepare or get away before it dissipates.														
999	3	4	Ventriloquism	Fukuwajutsu	Fukuwajutsu is a simple, sound-based ninjutsu technique. Forming the needed handseals, the shinobi will project his voice to any place within unaugmented sight to hide his location and the number of allies at their side.														
999	3	5	Open Slot																
999	3	6	Open Slot																
999	4	1	Instantaneous Body Technique	Shunshin no Jutsu 	An ability which allows the user to teleport from one area to another by stepping through a burst of chakra-made smoke. The user has to have been to the area before, distance is limited to about one mile, and it cannot be used in battle except to completely escape.														
999	4	2	Hand of Debris	Saihen no Te	By charging objects with chakra, the user can bind them together to make a hand, no larger than their own, to do their bidding. After it is created, the user gives it a command that may not exceed three words, such as Bring The Key or Strangle The Guard. It is remarkably dexterous, able to 'walk' on walls and seems capable of perceiving its surroundings. The hand has strength equal to the user's power and cannot be destroyed; the materials scatter but they simply reform. Four posts after its creation the hand falls apart. Particularly insidious shinobi have been known to make sure that some of the hand's fingers are kunai or needles, and sent it scampering after someone nearby that they want dead. 														
999	4	3	Iron Chain Calling Technique	Tessayose no Jutsu	With a range of the user's sight in a general given area, the user slams their hand against a surface. Anywhere on the surface in plain sight for the user calls five separate chains to tie down a target. The chains are made of simple iron but are extremely thick and heavy, but dispel once the target is completely free. This jutsu was designed mainly to fight Taijutsu Human Tank users. The chains are helpless against Ninjutsu techniques. These chains are completely normal save that the user can control their movement. Regardless of whether the victim has moved at all, these chains will disappear after three turns.														
999	4	4	Homing Roof Tile Shuriken Technique	Kisousei Ninpou Kawara Shuriken	The user is able to use chakra to seize and lift any object within their grasp. The object must be something that the user could normally lift and throw with one hand. The user then launches the item toward a target, preferably an enemy, whom it follows for up to three posts. The object cannot make 90 degree turns, and can only veer left or right. This makes turning around possible, but not sudden. If the object hits something like a tree or rock, it will stop. The user can lift and throw ten such objects at a time. Stage Five: As above, but the projectiles explode with the force of an explosive tag.														
999	4	5	The Art of Walking on Air	Tenkuu Hokou no Gyou	While airborne, the user can focus his chakra into his feet in order to make a sort of invisible stepping stone to push off of again. This can be used as a sort of double-jump commonly seen from, say, Mario, or be used to push off and change directions in midair. This technique can only be used once per jump, and the strength of the second jump is no greater than the strength of a normal jump. For instance, if your character has a five foot vertical leap, using this technique he could conceivably jump ten feet into the air. 														
999	4	6	Open Slot																
999	5	1	Stinging Mist Technique	Hiritsuku Kasumi no Jutsu	The ninja inhales and sends out a spray of stinging substance from his mouth. The technique itself looks like the fine spray from a hose, with the droplets being a slightly yellowish color. It causes intense itching sensation on the skin of the afflicted, causes temporary blindness in the eyes and swelling in the throat cavity of anyone who inhales the gas, fading only after three posts. Once the substance leaves their mouth the user and his allies would be well advised to stay clear.														
999	5	2	Underworld Spines	Togeyomi	When activated, this technique instantly lengthens and hardens the hair, changing it into a protective coat of spines that covers the body. The spines are sharp enough to easily pierce anybody making contact with the user, such as during taijutsu attacks, but the coat doesn't protect the user from ninjutsu at all. The spines last for two posts before the hair softens and returns to its previous length.														
999	5	3	Higher Element Hand	Takai Yoso no Te	An improvement on the original Yoso no Te, this technique begins the same way. Rather than create a single chakra arm, however, the user is able to create six at once, three pairs of arms that all seem to be attached around the user's shoulders. As before, these arms can be composed of any element the user can control or can just be solidified chakra. These arms are much stronger than before and function with half the Strength of the user. Power 25: The user can create seven total arms. Power 32: The user can create eight total arms. Control 24: The elemental arms have half the Strength of the user. Control 31: The elemental arms have the full Strength of the user.														
999	5	4	Thousand Birds	Chidori 	The only original technique of Konohagakure's legendary Hatake Kakashi, the user focuses an enormous amount of chakra into one hand, so much that it becomes visible and emits a chirping noise like the sound of a thousand birds. The shinobi runs towards his enemy and thrusts quickly to cut through him, and the jutsu is indeed so powerful that it is rumored to be able to halve even a lightning bolt. However, because the user is moving so fast to attack, he is unable to detect any counterattacks executed by the enemy, so it is ideal to use Chidori in tandem with another technique that can alert the user to counters, such as a doujutsu. 														
999	5	5	Rasengan 	Spiral Sphere	Developed by Yondaime Hokage and later adopted by Uzumaki Naruto as one of his signature techniques, Rasengan forms a spiral sphere of compact chakra in the palm of the user's hand. It does not look like much, but it packs a tremendously uber punch, capable of blowing out holes in metal and blasting enemies through most surfaces, whether they be walls, ceilings, or rocks. In addition to the severe knockback power this possesses, the Rasengan is capable of dealing internal damage, making it a very valuable jutsu. 														
999	5	6	Open Slot																
999	6	1	Shadow Clone Technique	Kage Bunshin no Jutsu	A forbidden jutsu that creates perfect clones of the user, not just plain illusions. Each clone is a spitting image of the user, capable of attacking and using jutsu the user knows, except Kage Bunshin, and spending the original's jutsu usages to do so. A direct hit causes the clones to vanish and each clone may only use a single jutsu before vanishing as well. The user can have five clones at once. Power 28: The user can have ten clones at once. Power 35: The user can have fifteen clones at once.														
999	6	2	Evil Sealing Method	Fuuja Houin	This method of sealing can be preformed both voluntarily and involuntarily. When done involuntarily, the user has no time for preparation, and therefore the job is a sloppy one. The user must make physical contact with the target. If the target does not have a curse seal, nothing happens. If they do, the technique shuts it down, cutting off all benefits their seal may have provided them and leaving the penalties for the remainder of the thread. When done voluntarily the user has more time to prepare, creating an elaborate sealing ritual that differs from person to person, but always has the same effect; the seal is contained. Exactly what this entails varies from seal to seal, the effects varying from shutting down some benefits and mollifying some disadvantages to making the seal safe to use at all. Its duration is indefinite. 														
999	6	3	Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique	Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu	Similar to Kage Bunshin no Jutsu, this technique allows the user to create many identical copies of a thrown projectile. Usually, this jutsu is performed after the item is already in flight, at which point a massive number of copies split from the original. This can create a veritable wall of kunai all streaking towards an enemy. Once they strike a solid surface, the copies quickly dissipate, but deal normal damage before vanishing.														
999	6	4	Underworld Spears	Shogiyomi 	An upgraded version of the Togeyomi, this version instead creates long sharp spears of hair that extend to about double the arm's length of the user. Not as fragile as the Togeyomi, the spears can absorb a Stage Six ninjutsu without breaking. However, after blocking an attack, the spears break down and return to normal. The spears themselves are as sharp as true spears and extend with great force and speed to catch close targets off guard.

999	7	1	Exploding Shadow Clone Technique	Bakuretsu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu															
999	7	2	Deadlock	Ikidzumari	The user sets six boundaries with his tags in the shape of a rectangle, one tag to set each corner, one tag to set the bottom, and one tag at the top. Altogether they could use the technique to completely swallow a small home, though no larger. Once the boundaries have been set the user holds both their hands into a seal and focuses, turning the inside of their rectangle into a chakra dead zone. A technique from outside the boundaries could rip the user to splinters, but any within finds themselves pitted against the user's power in a spiritual tug-of-war. It does not distinguish between friend and foe; all chakra is cut off. The Deadlock has enough juice to fizzle four techniques before collapsing on itself, rebounding on the user and knocking them unconscious. While the jutsu is in progress they may move, but can use no jutsu of their own.														
999	7	3	Open Slot																
999	7	4	Open Slot																
999	7	5	Spiral Bomb	Rasenbakudan	The technique begins with the user creating a spiraling sphere of pure chakra in their palm, much as with Rasengan, but with far more density, turning the orb dark. The user then holds out their hand and expels the sphere forward at intense speeds with a burst of chakra. It continues on a straight path until it comes into contact with any object, after which it explodes outward with enough concussive force to turn a small neighborhood into a ruin, and anyone close to the blast into a sizable bloodstain. If it is fired and misses it continues moving, and if it does not hit anything dissipates to nothing over the course of an hour.														
999	7	6	Armor Of The Thousand Birds	Chidori no Koutetsu	The user takes the same coating that they used to turn their hand into a deadly weapon and applies it to the whole of their body, shielding them inside energy capable of deflecting lightning, (stage six and lower) and making all parts of their body into a weapon, capable of running through stone and leaving a man-shaped hole behind, and augmenting their hand-to-hand attacks so that every one could tear through flesh and bone as easy as the open air. Upon initiation, white light flares from their whole body, and the signature sound of Chidori's chirping turns far louder. It would take a blind and deaf man to not see that a shinobi was in this state. The technique lasts for three posts, after which the user is rendered incapable of using any jutsu above stage three for the remainder of the thread due to the intense strain this technique has on the Inner Coils.														
998	1	1	Medical Training	Igaku Kunren 	This is a passive technique representing the intense training that most medic nin undergo. Medics are taught to recognize injuries and diseases through symptoms and signs, but trained medics can detect hidden or invisible symptoms by kneeling next to patients and running their hands over the patient's body. If the medic runs chakra through his hands this way, he can detect internal injuries, heart rate, hairline fractures, poisons, and diseases. Further, the medic knows how to properly clean their hands, arms, and face for medical purposes with chakra, preventing them from accidentally infecting a patient during surgery, even out in the field. Base Effect: One full post to fully diagnose a patient. Stage Two: One action to fully diagnose a patient. Stage Three: The medic may autopsy a well-preserved body with the same diagnostic method														
998	1	2	Power of Resistance	Teikouryoku	A medic must always be wary of becoming a victim of whatever his patient suffers from. With this technique, a medic can temporarily increase his resistance to mundane diseases and poisons. However, it has no effect against diseases or poisons already affecting the medic. Base Effect: Two posts of immunity to non-chakra based diseases and poisons. Stage Two: Three posts of immunity. The medic may now affect an ally in addition to himself. Stage Three: Four posts of immunity. The medic may now affect three allies in addition to himself.														
998	1	3	Caretaker	Kanrinin	Though medics are taught to treat injuries with tools and medicines the way normal doctors or nurses might, many learn how to take care of basic ailments through chakra means. As the medic grows in skill and knowledge, he he expands his repertoire of chakra-assisted techniques. Base Effect: At this level, the medic is able to extract foreign objects and clean wounds by laying his hands on either side of an injury and using chakra to lift debris up and away. This allows the medic to prepare a wound for treatment without causing further damage. Objects piercing vital organs require a full post of concentration to remove safely. Stage Two: By holding his hands over a patient's chest, the medic may now perform a kind of chakra-assisted CPR. The hearts and lungs are massaged into normal functioning, allowing the medic to keep a patient with breath and blood flow even if injured. However, if the airway is blocked, this technique is useless. Stage Three: The medic can now use chakra to stabilize a patient's body temperature, expending chakra to spread heat over the body or to siphon heat away into the air. He cannot use this ability to cause abnormal temperatures (ie create fevers or cause hypothermia), but once treated a patient remains at healthy temperature for five posts. Stage Four: Now the medic may perform impromptu blood transfusions by making a small incision on a willing donor and a patient. Chakra is used to create a thin, invisible tube through which blood flows from the donor into the recipient and alters the blood to the proper type for the recipient. Each post transfers about a normal IV bag worth of blood from one person to another.														
998	1	4	Disease Containment	Byouki no Fujikome	By placing a hand on a patient and sending chakra through the whole body, a medic can isolate and contain vectors of disease. The medic raises his hand from the patient and glowing chakra pulls out of the patient, gathering the disease itself into a floating mass. The user then presses his hand into an open scroll, causing the extracted disease to float down into the page and seal within in as symbols and kanji appear around it, locking it in place. The kanji indicate what disease has just been sealed. Once removed from the body, the patient is effectively cured of his disease, though any damage caused must still be treated normally. Base Effect: The medic can seal fungus-based diseases, like athlete's foot or aspergillosis. Stage Two: The medic can seal substance-based diseases, like poisons or hayfever. Stage Three: The medic can seal bacteria-based diseases, like salmonella or tetanus. Stage Four: The medic can seal virus-based diseases, like the common cold or influenza.														
998	1	5	Forbidden Technique: Disease Propagation	Kinjutsu: Byouki no Denpa	The user most open a scroll that has a disease sealed into it, and performs handseals to release the disease from within the scroll. The vector of disease hangs in the air in a ball of glowing chakra, just in front of the medic's open palm. Then, the user may slam his hand against an enemy target, pressing the disease into the target's body as he does so. The target is thus infected with the released disease, though it does not fully take root until a post later. The disease rapidly progresses to the same stage as it was when it was removed from a patient. Base Effect: The medic may infect targets with fungus-based diseases. Stage Two: The medic may infect targets with substance-based diseases. Stage Three: The medic may infect targets with bacteria-based diseases. Stage Four: The medic may infect targets with virus-based diseases.														
998	1	6	Forbidden Technique: Corpse Search	Kinjutsu: Shibito Tankyuu	The user does a series of seals, then presses his hand against the ground. A chakra pulse runs through the earth like a radar wave, allowing the medic to find corpses hidden in the ground. This allows him to detect corpses within a fifty foot radius as well as determine what sort of animal made each corpse. He can use this to direct himself to the nearest dead body.														
998	2	1	Blood Coagulation	Keksuki Gyouko	A simple healing technique, the medic performs handseals and then touches a patient's open wound. The blood there coagulates, forming a clot that prevents the wound from bleeding any further. This is only a preliminary treatment as it does not stop internal bleeding. Superficial wounds can be clotted instantly, but deep wounds require a post of concentration.														
998	2	2	Poison Removal	Jokyo Dokubutsu	A medic with this technique can quickly protect a patient or ally from the effects of a poison by delaying its effects. After seals, he need simply make physical contact with a target, allowing his chakra to transfer into the target's body. The chakra wraps around poison in the blood and body tissues, forming a shell that prevents it from working. This allows a medic to prepare a true antidote. Base Effect: Two post delay. Stage Three: Three post delay or poisons costing 2 weapon points or fewer, or stage two or lower, can be destroyed. Stage Four: Four post delay or poisons costing 3 weapon points or fewer, or stage three or lower, can be destroyed.														
998	2	3	Fanged Tongue Acid	Zesshi Nensan	The user performs seals and then opens his mouth, expelling a highly corrosive acid. The stream can reach up to twenty feet away and is strong enough to cause first degree burns and eat through fabric, paper, and other weak materials. Launching acid from the mouth requires cautious control on behalf of the medic, so this technique cannot be used while moving at high speeds to keep from burning the user. Base Effect: As above. Stage Three: Acid can reach thirty feet and causes second degree burns. Stage Four: Acid can reach fifty feet and causes third degree burns.														
998	2	4	Seal Person Frozen to Death	Fuuin Toushisha	This jutsu only works on dead bodies, but allows a medic to preserve a corpse indefinitely. After performing seals, the user places his hand on a corpse. A unique seal appears over the corpse's flesh, a white square within a black circle, accented by the kanji for ice and corpse in red. As long as the seal remains on the corpse, it will not naturally decompose any further. The seal is recognizable to other medics and can be disrupted and removed by a controlled chakra pulse, even by non-medics.														
998	2	5	Forbidden Technique: Transform Corpse	Kinjutsu: Henge Shibito	Through a special application of chakra, a medic can alter the appearance of a corpse. A dead body may be altered to look like some other individual as bone and facial structure can be physically altered; this technique cannot be dispelled like a normal Henge no Jutsu. The user may change a corpse's face, hair, build, and apparent sex, but cannot change internal organs. Other medics with this jutsu may reverse the process.														
998	2	6	Open Slot																
998	3	1	Healing Hands Technique	Chiyute no Jutsu	The user concentrates chakra into his hands, creating a ball of specialized healing chakra, often characterized by a green glow. When directed into another body, this healing chakra is capable of repairing damage to tissue. Virtually every medic learns this technique, as it is the cornerstone of ninja medicine. Healing chakra may be redirected into the user's own body, but regardless of who the patient is, healing takes at least one post to complete. Base Effect: The medic can heal superficial cuts, first degree burns, hairline fractures, and damage from light fevers and coughs. Stage Four: The medic can heal gashes, second degree burns, sprains, partial fractures and torn tendons.														
998	3	2	Medicine Creation	Kigusuri Souzou	A medic nin is trained to study the effects of natural and artificial compounds on the human body and how they can be combined to create medicines. This technique represents an ability of the medic to create medicines such as antidotes, ointments, serums, and so on. Medicines can be used to treat everyday ailments like upset stomachs or colds, but can also be used to create antidotes for poisons costing 3 weapons points or fewer or at stage two or below. The medic may also craft chloroform, aspirin, and Novocaine without affecting his own weapon points. Creating medicine takes at least one post, but does not expend any of the user's chakra and can be shared with multiple patients or allies. Base Effect: As above. Stage Four: Poisons costing 4 weapon points or fewer or at stage three or below can have antidotes created.														
998	3	3	Thunder Hands Technique	Hekirekite no Jutsu	After performing seals, the user focuses chakra into his hands in order to create an electrical shock strong enough to restart a patient's heart. The medic must be careful with how he places his hands, putting near the patient's shoulder and the other on the lower chest, so that the electrical current travels through the heart without damaging any other tissue. In order to be performed safely, the patient must be motionless and dry and the user must have full concentration for a post. As such, it is virtually impossible to shock an enemy's heart during combat.														
998	3	4	Forbidden Technique: Dead Soul One	Kinjutsu: Shikon Ichi	The medic runs chakra into a corpse, causing it to come 'alive'. In truth, the body is still dead, but can be controlled by the user to act lifelike. The corpse retains the strength and speed it had in life, but has zero stamina and does not have taijutsu bonuses. Controlled corpses may not use jutsu and must stay within ten feet of the user or the technique ends and they crumple to the ground. The user may control one corpse at a time. This may not be used in conjunction with any other level of Dead Soul.														
998	3	5	Forbidden Technique: Precious Human Sacrifice	Kinjutsu: Kichou Hitomigokuu	The user performs seals over a recently dead body, requiring a corpse no more than two days old. While living, the corpse had been a vessel for chakra, a powerful energy. The medic may extract the remnants of chakra still inside the corpse, allowing him to recover his own chakra supply by consuming that of the dead. The corpse becomes desiccated as chakra is drained from it and the user requires a whole body to properly bolster his stores. This technique may only be used once per thread and has a one thread cooldown (so at most, it may only be used once every other thread). Base Effect: The user regains all uses of stage four or below, from taijutsu, ninjutsu, or genjutsu. Thus, he could replenish his ability to use stage three jutsu, but would have no impact on any other usage limit. Jutsu with per thread limits are not affected. Stage Four: As above, but may restore stage five and below.														
998	3	6	Open Slot																
998	4	1	Chakra Scalpel	Chakra Enjintou	A ninjutsu primarily used for field surgery, the medic concentrates a powerful aura of chakra around his hand. This chakra creates a thin blade visible as a blue glow. The blade is capable of bypassing flesh within harming it, allowing a medic to operate on arteries, tendons, and muscles without opening the skin. This also allows a medic to fix a patient's chakra coils if they have been damaged by some other technique. When used in combat, a medic could give an enemy internal wounds, but maintaining the chakra scalpel at combat speed is difficult and eats up a stage usage per post when wielded this way.														
998	4	2	Poison Creation	Souzou Dokubutsu	Just as there are many naturally occuring substances that can be combined to heal, so too can they be combined to harm. Using his knowledge of plants, animals, and minerals, the medic is able to mix together drugs and poisons that range from disabling to deadly. Given at least a post of prep time, the medic can concoct all manner of poisons with basic supplies. This allows the medic to create even unique poisons that he has encountered before. Base Effect: The user can create any registered poison costing 3 or fewer weapon points. Stage Five: The user can create any registered poison costing 4 or fewer weapon points.														
998	4	3	Poison Gas Technique	Biransei no Jutsu	The medic performs seals and then exhales, creating a cloud of poison gas that erupts from his mouth in a stream. The cloud expands into an area in front of the medic, so as not to catch himself in his own technique. Anyone within the thirty foot diameter cloud and breathes the gas succumbs to the poison's effects. In the first post, a victim begins to feel numb throughout his body. The second post of exposure muffles sound. The third post of exposure blinds the victim. At the end of the fourth round of continued exposure, the victim falls unconscious. The cloud lasts for four posts and any poisoned victim who escapes the cloud remains poisoned for two posts.														
998	4	4	Corpse Organ Transplant	Shibito Zoukiishoku	The user can use a recently deceased corpse to replace lost limbs or organs on a living patient. First, the desired part is removed from the corpse, then the medic performs surgery on the patient to knit the two pieces together. This process takes three posts to complete with the corpse piece returning to function during the process. As the patient recovers from the surgery, the replacement part typically changes to resemble the original lost limb or organ.														
998	4	5	Forbidden Technique: Departed Soul Memory Recollection	Kinjutsu: Boukon Kioku no Jutsu	The medic performs a string of handseals and then places his hand over a corpse's skull. As long as the corpse's brain is intact, the medic may comb through the corpse's memories, allowing him to take information. He may not, however, learn jutsu this way. The corpse must have died within the last hour or the memories cannot be salvaged.														
998	4	6	Open Slot																
998	5	1	Killing Hands	Satsugaite	The medic focuses chakra into the palms of his hands, creating a small ball of killing chakra, which is the opposite of the Healing Hands' healing chakra. This chakra is characterized by a black or purple light and, rather than rebuild a patient's cells, it destroys and unravels them. When the medic makes contact with an enemy, he can send some of the killing chakra into the target's body, where it attacks them from inside. If applied to a limb, blood flow can be restricted to cause numbness. If applied to an organ, it can create ulcers, lesions, and so on. The medic must be able to maintain contact for at least five seconds in order to begin destroying tissue, so a fleeting touch can do little more than cause pain.														
998	5	2	Central Nervous System Electrical Shock	Chuusuusei Shikeikiden	The user turns his chakra into an electrical pulse which is transmitted to an enemy's body by striking the base of the neck. The electrical impulse travels up into the brain stem and disrupts the flow electricity through the nervous system. The brain and body connection is affected, confusion communication between the two. If the victim tries to move his arm, he moves his leg, and the victim is generally debilitated as sensory information is mistranslated by the brain. Base Effect: Two post duration. Intelligence 24: Three post duration.														
998	5	3	Perfect Function	Kanpekina Kino	The medic gathers his chakra into his hands and then transfers it into a target by dissipating it a body with a touch. The chakra sinks deep into tissues and enhances them, allowing an affected target to operate at peak efficiency and effectiveness. Muscles benefit from greatly increased force, nervous fire and receive synapses faster, and skin and bones are toughened by the chakra. Base Effect: An ally's Strength, Speed, and Stamina levels are all increased by one for two posts. Afterward, they lose a level off base for one post from fatigue. This drop can reduce a subject's levels to zero without killing them. Control 25: As above, but levels are altered by +/-2. Control 32: As above, but levels are altered by +/-3.														
998	5	4	Okina Byouki no Fujikome - Greater Disease Containment	Okina Byouki no Fujikome	By placing a hand on a patient and sending chakra through the whole body, a medic can isolate and contain vectors of disease. The medic raises his hand from the patient and glowing chakra pulls out of the patient, gathering the disease itself into a floating mass. The user then presses his hand into an open scroll, causing the extracted disease to float down into the page and seal within in as symbols and kanji appear around it, locking it in place. The kanji indicate what disease has just been sealed. Once removed from the body, the patient is effectively cured of his disease, though any damage caused must still be treated normally. Sealing a disease requires a full post of concentration and a motionless patient. At this level, the medic often alters the patient's body to accomplish his task. Base Effect: The medic can seal environment-based diseases, such as allergies or some forms of cancer. A patient may only be treated by this jutsu once in his lifetime; further uses would kill the patient. Intelligence 25: As above, but the medic can seal genetic diseases, such as sickle cell or haemophilia. This counts as a stage six usage. Intelligence 32: As above, but the medic can seal diseases with unknown or complex causes, such as Alzheimer's and autism. This counts as a stage seven usage.														
998	5	5	Forbidden Technique: Greater Disease Propagation	Kinjutsu: Okina Byouki no Denpa	The user most open a scroll that has a disease sealed into it, and performs handseals to release the disease from within the scroll. The vector of disease hangs in the air in a ball of glowing chakra, just in front of the medic's open palm. Then, the user may slam his hand against an enemy target, pressing the disease into the target's body as he does so. The target is thus infected with the released disease, though it does not fully take root until a post later. The disease rapidly progresses to the same stage as it was when it was removed from a patient. Base Effect: The medic may infect targets with environment-based diseases. Control 26: The medic may infect targets with genetic diseases. This counts as a stage six usage. Control 33: The medic may infect targets with diseases of unknown cause. This counts as a stage seven usage.														
998	5	6	Forbidden Technique: Dead Soul Two	Kinjutsu: Shikon Nii	An improvement upon the original Dead Soul One, the medic runs chakra into a corpse, causing it to come 'alive'. In truth, the body is still dead, but can be controlled by the user to act lifelike. The corpse retains the strength and speed it had in life, but functions as if it only had half of its original stamina and half of its taijutsu bonuses. Full stamina is used for any stat requirements on taijutsu. Controlled corpses may not use jutsu and must stay within thirty feet of the user or the technique ends and they crumple to the ground. The user may control two corpses at a time. This may not be used in conjunction with any other level of Dead Soul.														
998	6	1	Healing Hands Technique: Major	Chiyute no Jutsu: Ichidanto	The user concentrates chakra into his hands, creating a ball of specialized healing chakra, often characterized by a green glow. When directed into another body, this healing chakra is capable of repairing damage to tissue. Virtually every medic learns this technique, as it is the cornerstone of ninja medicine. Healing chakra may be redirected into the user's own body, but regardless of who the patient is, healing takes at least one post to complete. With this level of the technique, most medics reach the limit of what can be accomplished without the aid of a hospital and other medic nin. The medic can heal deep gashes, punctures, serious fractures, organ damage, and other semi-fatal injuries. Most minor and moderate illnesses can be treated with a regular application of this technique through the day.														
998	6	2	Ninja Medicine Creation	Ninja Kigusuri Souzou	With this level of knowledge, the medic is now a skill shinobi pharmacist, able to use his advanced skills to make medicines. He can make medical items unique to the shinobi world, such as soldier pills, blood replenishment pills, and false death pills. The medic may also concoct an antidote to any poison, regardless of its weapon point cost or that is stage six or lower. Further, the user may create any universal medical item and any registered by other users if he receives permission. Creating advanced medical supplies requires at least a post of work.														
998	6	3	Cell Regeneration	Saisei no Saibou	 A ninjutsu technique where the user focuses all of his chakra into one part of his body just before an attack. The moment that the attack connects, the chakra activates the user's cells and causes them to rapidly regenerate. This repairs damage at the exact moment it is done and is an extremely powerful jutsu. The amount of chakra required is enormous, preventing the medic from using this more than once per thread. However, the regeneration allows the user to survive any injury, even decapitation or ruptured organs.														
998	6	4	Heart Thrust Technique	Shinzou no Suiryoku no Jutsu	Pooling chakra into his fingertips, the medic delivers a swift, direct blow to a target's thorax. The attack must be precisely accurate, but once it lands, the medic's chakra is capable of causing enormous harm to the opponent's heart. The chakra sends a wave of electrical impulses directly into the target's heart, causing a heart attack. Further, the medic is able to give the target tachycardia, arrhythmia, and other serious heart conditions.														
998	6	5	Forbidden Technique: Seal Fresh Frozen Corpse	Kinjutsu: Fuuin Ikijime Shibito	A similar jutsu to its predecessor, this allows the medic to preserve a corpse with a seal. However, the kanji for the seal change from 'ice' and 'corpse' to 'ice' and 'body'. After making handseals, the user slams his palm into a target's chest, living or dead. When applied to a living target, that person falls into a coma and remains in hibernation as long as the seal remains on the body. The living subject is effectively frozen in time, surviving without food, water, or any other bodily need. As with the original technique, the seal may be disrupted and removed by other shinobi with a simple chakra pulse. Opponent permission required.														
998	6	6	Open Slot																
998	7	1	Psychic Surgery	Shinreitejutsu	This technique is used to perform major surgical procedures without needing instruments. The medic performs hand seals and holds healing chakra around his hands, causing them to glow. Then, he can cut a body open with his chakra, place his hands directly into a patient's body, and perform whatever surgery he wills. This technique can be used to repair even dead tissue or restore bones from powder. Even the gravest of wounds or injuries can be fixed by the medic, but this technique requires at least two posts to safely open up a channel for surgery and close it again.														
998	7	2	Neuralgia	Shinkeitsuu	In order to use this technique, the medic gathers chakra into his hand and then touches any point on the target's body. The chakra instantly transfers to the target's body, assaulting the nerves in the immediate area with pain so severe that it's debilitating. The paid spreads through the target's whole body and is so intense that withstanding it is largely impossible. Many victims have been reduced to writhing and screaming as the pain overwhelms them. The pain stays at peak severity for only one post, but leaves the target's body sore for at least a day.														
998	7	3	Secret Technique: Enlightenment	Hijutsu: Keihatsu	One of the most powerful medical techniques ever invented, this requires at least four other medics able to perform Healing Hands and willing to lend their assistance to the user. The medic must first inscribe a circle of intricate seals on the floor, preparing the area to hold and channel the healing chakra required for this technique. This process requires an hour as each seal holds some of the user's chakra.  Then, a severely wounded patient or animal is placed in the center of the circle. The other four medics take up position at four corners, forming a square around the circle. The user stands to one side of the circle and works in unison with the other medics, drawing their healing chakra together into a pool over the patient. The mass of healing chakra is directed into the patient's body and rapidly heals them of all injuries, ailments, poisons, diseases, and so on. The patient is restored to perfect health and function, and the user even has the ability alter a patient's DNA, removing genetic disorders or completely altering a patient's body into someone else. As long as the faintest hint of life remains within the subject, he can be revived.  Alternately, the circle can be drawn around the base of a plant, allowing the medic to heal blighted trees and so on. This jutsu cannot be used in combat, of course, and is best performed at a hospital where other medics can be on hand.														
998	7	4	Forbidden Technique: Dead Soul Three	Kinjutsu: Shikon San	An improvement upon Dead Soul Three, the medic runs chakra into a corpse, causing it to come 'alive'. In truth, the body is still dead, but can be controlled by the user to act lifelike. The corpse retains the strength, speed, and stamina it had in life and also receives full taijutsu bonuses. Controlled corpses may not use jutsu and must stay within fifty feet of the user or the technique ends and they crumple to the ground. The user may control three corpses at a time. This may not be used in conjunction with any other level of Dead Soul.

998	8	1	Forbidden Technique: Brain Transferring	Kinjutsu: Nou no Tensha	A forbidden technique rumored to have been developed by the genius Kabuto under the employ of Orochimaru, this jutsu allows the user to perform a particular, special surgery. Two patients, usually restrained but sometimes willing, are prepared within special seal circles. Then, the medic can place one hand on each patient's head and begin to swap their personalities, memories, and consciousnesses. Effectively, the medic transfers the brains between the bodies. The process is grueling as the consciousness must be severed from one body, transferred to another, and tied back in to the new vessel, and takes five posts to perform completely. Note: The characters exchange physical descriptions, physical stats, and bloodline abilities. The exchange is permanent unless reversed by another application of this technique.

996	1	1	Tracer Arrow	Hariganeya	Channelling a small amount of chakra into the arrow and the bow, the user is able to create a light but durable wire connecting the bow and arrow together. The wire will grow in length for as long as needed to maintain the connection, but it can be made to stop growing whenever the users wishes, or even shrink if so desired. Lastly, arrows fired after this technique is used may also be connected to the wire created if desired, or alternately the string may simply be disconnected, causing it to disappear after a short time (three posts). Naturally however this technique requires great caution to use, as careless use can lead to the users position being given away.														
996	1	2	Noisemaker Arrow	Kaburaya	This technique uses the user's chakra to turn a normal arrow into a distraction. The user focuses their chakra in the arrow's tip, then fires it. When the arrow lands or impacts something, the user's chakra dispels outwards, creating a loud bang designed to distract enemies														
996	1	3	Flare	Shoumeidan	Shoumeidan can be used as a tool or as an attack. The user concentrates chakra in the tip of an arrow and fires it. Upon impact, the chakra explodes outward, shattering the arrowhead and releasing a flash of light. The intensity of the light can be controlled by the user, ranging from a low, constant light used to illuminate an area to a bright flash designed to blind an enemy temporarily (1 post). Due to the volatile nature of the chakra imbued into the arrow, the chakra disperses slowly while the arrow is in flight, leaving a glowing silver streak in the air that clearly identifies the shooter's location

996	2	1	Smoke Arrow	Kageya	Upon firing an arrow at either a person or any other hard surface, a large cloud of smoke will billow out from the arrowhead, shrouding the general area in smoke for up to one post.														
996	2	2	Decoy Arrow	Koujiya	Firing a single charged arrow quite quickly, the arrow becomes a clone that appears just like it is the user dashing away. Due to how quickly it often occurs, it is not typically possible to see through, as such it is a very useful jutsu for distracting attackers, or making pursuit difficult; though. But as the Decoy clone hits something it will transform back into an arrow with a cloud of smoke. Hitting this clone will also make it change into an arrow again.														
996	2	3	Snake Arrow	Hebiya	Instilling one or more arrows with chakra and firing them, the flying arrows will writhe like snakes through the air. If the arrow fails to hit the target the snakes can continue to slither and chase the target, but after striking a target or being struck, they turn back into a normal arrow. Regardless, after 2 post the arrows will change change back to a normal arrow.														
996	2	4	Needle Arrow shower	Fukibari Uchuuya	Shooting an arrow towards the enemy, the fired arrow multiplies into twenty miniature arrows, each about half the size of a senbon needle. The tiny arrows will travel in a straight path, causing numerous cuts and slashes to anyone caught within it, and when combined with other techniques can prove quite powerful if used correctly.														
996	2	5	Open Slot																
996	2	6	Open Slot																
996	3	1	Arrow of Weariness	Hirou no Tooya	A technique where the user fires a single arrow towards the enemy. Providing that the arrow comes close to the target, the arrow explodes into a gas that will surround them, making them feel unbearably tired and sluggish. This sedative doesn't make someone pass out, but it puts them in a groggy state that slows their reaction speed. Base Effect: 1 Post Stage 4: 2 Posts Stage 5: 3 Posts														
996	3	2	Eye of the Arrow	Ya no Me	The user fires an arrow into a hard surface such as a tree trunk or the ground, in a seemingly foolish move. This arrow will strike silently, and can now act as a second pair of eyes and ears, able to spy on the surrounding area in secret, for it has the appearance of a normal arrow. The arrow has a similar range of sight as the daisen no me, but lacks the manoeuvrability of one. It can be used as a listening device as well, able to pick up any voices or noises in the general area and relay them back to the archer's ears.														
996	3	3	Melting Arrow	Hyoukaiya	The user creates an arrow purely from chakra, though it looks and feels like a normal arrow. The difference comes in when the arrow is fired and approaches the intended target. Rather than simply striking the target, the arrow will melt into a sticky substance that will powerfully bind anything it touches, such that a targets ability to move may be severely hampered if they are unable to avoid getting struck.														
996	3	4	Knockback Arrow	Oshiya	The user fires a specially prepared arrow at the target, with a pocket of chakra surrounding the arrowhead. This chakra pocket has two effects, firstly it will compel the arrow to move much faster than normal, causing to accelerate as it flies rather than slowing down. Secondly, if it hits its target it will strike with a powerful blow, as if a large blunt object had struck the opponent, and will force them back a few steps or even knock them down depending on the rank of the shinobi using this technique. The degree of knock back ability depends on how physically built the opponent is, nonetheless it's a good jutsu for if the archer gets cornered up close.

996	3	6	Open Slot																
996	4	1	Arrow Net	Mouya	After firing an arrow at the target, the arrow will split into two, and then again for a total of 6 arrows. Each of the arrows are connected to each other by strands of thread, and instead of striking an enemy the arrows will be aimed towards the ground, where they were bury themselves firmly upon striking it, trapping anything in it's path to the ground with it. The thread is about as strong as average wire, but thicker and slightly more durable. Someone who is well versed in taijutsu can break the thread without much difficulty, while a kunai or other sharp blade will take 1 post to cut through it.														
996	4	2	Underground Arrows	Dochuuya	The user fires several arrows straight into the ground (limit 5 arrows) that will pass through the ground and remain hidden underneath the surface. At the user's command, they can be released to explode upwards, possibly skewering anyone within its path. A great jutsu for setting up ambushes to unsuspecting enemies, however due to its nature it's not practical to use in a heated battle.														
996	4	3	Whirlwind Arrow	Senpuuya	This particular jutsu is aimed at breaking through defences of a target. It does so by spinning incredibly rapidly once it has been fired, such that it will create what appears like a horizontal whirlwind, in a way that the air itself becomes visible swirling around the arrow. As the arrow flies the air surrounding it will often push objects in-front of it out of the way, though objects caught behind it may be pulled along due to the whirlwind like motion. Often when striking powerful defences it is a three stage attack, with the first part being the wind attempting to force through or damage the defence, followed by the rapidly spinning arrow striking, which is naturally capable of penetrating further due to this, finally finishing with any debris that was picked up striking afterwards with a moderate degree of force.														
996	4	4	Earthquake Arrow	Jishinya	Instilling an arrow with a great amount of chakra, the user fires the arrow straight into the ground, preferable in the vicinity of the enemy. The arrow hits the ground with enough force to cause a minor tremor and make the ground shake in that area for several seconds. This technique is very useful in interrupting attacking foes.														
996	4	5	Open Slot																
996	4	6	Open Slot																
996	5	1	Arrow Magnet	Jishakuya	A subtle yet useful technique against quick enemies that are adept at dodging, however it requires the user to connect the shot with their enemy's body. Firing an arrow straight towards the target, it will immediately be absorbed into their body upon striking it. This arrow acts as a homing device, for any subsequent arrows fired will be drawn towards it like a magnet, making dodging the arrows quite difficult. The effects last for up to 3 posts until the homing effect dissolves completely.														
996	5	2	Explosion Arrow	Bakuhatsuya	Infusing an arrowhead with a great amount of chakra, the user fires the arrow at the target. Upon striking any surface the arrow will cause an explosion powerful enough to cause medium sized craters in the ground. Taking a direct hit from this will be quite painful and is likely to injure the opponent quite badly.														
996	5	3	Arrow Spit	Tsubaya	A unique jutsu in the sense that it does not require a bow. Performing a simple seal the user opens their mouth and summons forth a torrent of arrows that fly outwards at great speeds, striking anything in its path. The stream of arrows is easily avoided at range; therefore it's a good technique for emergencies when the enemy gets too close to the archer or when they are unable to use their bow.														
996	5	4	Arrow Wall	Kabeya	The use fires several chakra infused arrows into the ground, where they will dive through the surface. Immediately after doing this, a large wall will arise from the ground, roughly several feet across, enough to offer a significant degree of protection to the user. This wall is actually made out of the arrows that were released into the ground, overlaying each other in a phalanx formation. The arrows are several times harder than their normal state; about the same density and hardness as steel, making the wall very durable against most form of attacks.														
996	5	5	Open Slot																
996	5	6	Open Slot																
996	6	1	Arrow Barrier	Nankanya	Firing four arrows simultaneously around a target, the user creates a temporary barrier that is completely impenetrable. It will trap foreign chakra sources and prevent them from exiting it, though chakra sources outside the barrier, foreign or not will be able to enter, though they will not be able to leave again until the barrier dissipates.														
996	6	2	Vibration Arrow	Shindouya	Infusing an arrow with a great amount of chakra, the arrow is fired in such a way that it sends out constant shockwaves during it's flight as well as for some time after it strikes. If struck by this arrow it would be very painful for the enemy, for even if the arrow passes nearby the target without striking, the shockwaves caused by the vibrations is powerful enough to make the get dizzy and want to vomit. It's primarily useful for when the enemy is trapped between the path of two vibration arrows, for the shockwaves from each of them is likely to render the enemy unconscious.														
996	6	3	Ethereal Arrow	Youkiya	Shooting a chakra infused arrow at the target, the arrow will pass through any type of matter in its path, turning solid only just before it is about to strike the target. While an excellent jutsu for breaking through tough defences, it cannot pass through things made from chakra if it was made by a stage 6 jutsu or higher.														
996	6	4	Shadow Arrow Multiplication	Kage Jouzanya	Channelling a great deal of chakra into a single arrow, the user looses it towards their target. Immediately after the arrow is released it will begin to replicate, creating first one extra arrow, then two, then four, and so on. This replication occurs quite rapidly, such that after having covered a short distance the arrows will have become quite numerous. The arrows continue to replicate the longer the first arrow remains in flight, as such some may even exploit this by firing the arrow high in the air, giving it greater flight time and causing countless arrows to rain down on those targeted.

996	6	6	Open Slot																
996	7	1	Choking Arrow	Ikigurushiiya	Using this technique, the user fires an arrow at the enemy. The arrow, instilled with chakra will fly normally, but upon nearing an enemy it will bend and wrap itself firmly around the targets neck, doing so with such speed that it is difficult to dodge unless one is prepared for such a change in the arrow (such as having already seen the technique before). Removal is difficult, for the arrow will secrete a sticky glue-like adhesive that will help keep it in place. The choking arrow will remain in place for 3 posts, with increasing in tension during each one. For example, during the first post the arrow will constrict the throat only slightly, but enough to make breathing a bit more difficult than normal. In the last post the arrow will likely make the user pass out from asphyxiation if they are unable to free themselves in time.														
996	7	2	Acceleration Arrow	Kasokudoya	Firing at most two arrows out at once, the user waits for them to reach a certain point before activating their effect. Once activated, the arrowhead immediately stops moving, though the rest of the arrow continues attempting to move forward resulting in the shaft of the arrow splintering into numerous thin pieces. These thin pieces immediately grow in size along with the arrowhead, appearing in a mere moment like an extremely large bowl or shield with the arrowhead protruding from the center, the shield typically over a meter wide. This shield sits several inches off the ground, and its orientation may be changed at the users will.														
996	7	3	Seeking Arrows	Tsuitouya	Whispering the targets name or location to the arrow, which then upon release, will do everything in its power to reach that location, almost taking on a mind of its own. It will dodge any static barriers put in its path, avoid incoming attacks and will not cease until its can strike directly into the target. Also of note is that the use of any bunshins (even kage bunshin) to fool the arrow are useless; they will immediately seek the first and only target the user directs them to.														
996	7	4	Arrow Missile	Tobidougoya	Similar to the Explosion arrow, the user prepares an arrow with chakra and aims for the target normally. Once released, the arrow becomes supercharged from the chakra, expelling steam and flying to incredible speeds so that anything nearby will be blown away or ripped to shreds. Upon striking the target, the arrow will detonate with the force five explosion tags, incinerating anything within a 20 meter radius. However if the user wishes to concentrate the effect they may carefully control the arrow such that the blast is focused entirely in one direction, making it excellent for penetrating static defenses

995	1	1	Shadow Weapons	Kagebuki no Jutsu	Reaching into the ground and seeming to reach into his own shadow, (or any local shadow), the user seems to pull out various different weapons from nothing but the shadow alone. The user makes simple shadow versions of weapons that look real enough, but when they make contact they disperse harmlessly. The user can, however, choose to hide a real weapon inside the cloud of fakes. Stage Two: User can hide three small projectiles or a single large one, such as a fuuma shuriken. Stage Three: User can hide ten small projectiles or three large ones.														
995	1	2	Cast-Off	Utsusemi no Jutsu	Upon seeing an attack coming towards his body, the ninja sheds a layer of clothing and falls away, leaving his clothes behind to take the blow and confuse the enemy. This is like a Kawarimi, but rather than change places with an object, the user slides out of his jacket or shirt and falls backwards behind it. As such, Utsusemi can only be used twice per thread and counts against the limit on other Kawarimi effects.														
995	1	3	Dance of Illusion	Maboroshi no Mai	The user summons mirror images of himself, which move simultaneously with him. These clones deal no damage, but are able to take separate paths, motions, and actions to attempt to confuse the enemy. The user is indistinguishable from his clones right up until an attack lands. Creates two clones, which vanish by the end of the same post. As these clones cannot directly harm a target, this jutsu does not count as an offensive action. Stage Two: Creates four clones of the user. Stage Three: Creates six clones of the user.														
995	1	4	False Images	Nise Zo	Spreading his chakra over a nearby surface, the user can change its appearance. This allows the ninja to create fake footprints along the earth, wet spots on tatami, or even bend a shadowy silhouette across a wall. These changes are purely visual and anyone who attempts to touch them easily realizes that they are essentially miniature Henge effects. False Images affects a five foot square area and lasts for two posts. Stage Two: Affects a ten by ten square and lasts three posts. Stage Three: Affects a fifteen by fifteen square and lasts until canceled.														
995	1	5	Sabotage	Bougyou	By simply running chakra through an object, the user is able to sabotage machinery, forcing it to function as he wishes. This could be used to both seal or open a lock, jam a crossbow, keep a rudder locked, and so on. Once an object has been tampered with this way, the user may dispel the effect early. Lasts for two posts. Stage Two: Lasts for three posts. The user can also detect object tampering. Stage Three: Lasts for four posts. The user can override a lower-stage usage of Sabotage.														
995	1	6	Open Slot																
995	2	1	Perfect Imitation	Kanryousou Gisei	The user molds his chakra around himself, altering his appearance to that of another person. Unlike the standard Henge no Jutsu, this technique does not dispel on simple contact. Instead, the user may maintain the image as long as he likes. However, opposing chakra, such as that in an enemy ninjutsu, disrupts the image and cancels the effect.														
995	2	2	Eye Technique: All-Seeing Eye	Doujutsu: Senrigan	Once activated, this technique allows the user to see at night. This night vision is just as clear as their daylight vision, but is in black and white. This jutsu may be maintained indefinitely with a low amount of chakra. Stage Three: The user can also see through mundane smoke and fog. Stage Four: The user is no longer colorblind at night - their vision has just as much color at day and at night. They may also expend a Stage Four jutsu usage to see through chakra-enhanced smoke, fog, or mist for two posts.														
995	2	3	Gathering Point	Ensou	The user summons a horde of dark clones that home in on one target and attempt to attack collectively. While the clones all carry the user's supply of weapons, each individual strike causes only minimal damage - bruises, small cuts, and so on. However, the number of successive strikes can overwhelm unprepared targets. At this stage, four clones appear and attack a target before vanishing in the same post. Stage Three: Eight clones appear and attack. Stage Four: Fifteen clones appear and attack.														
995	2	4	Weapon Concealment	Bukigakure no Jutsu	While shinobi are all taught how to hide weapons on their person, the user takes it one step further. Charged chakra around the body smooths weapons against the skin and hides them within cloth, making them undetectable even to a pat-down or even a strip search.														
995	2	5	Explosive Boom	Bakuhatsu Jaan no Jutsu	The shinobi charges chakra into a smoke bomb or pellet, changing its properties. When the bomb detonates, the sound is amplified enough to create a percussive blast that disorients those nearby. The booming is accompanied by a flash of lights and sparks that explode from the smoke. The force doesn't compare to a true explosive tag, but the sparks are still able to light fires. This enhanced bomb fills a ten foot radius and the noise lasts for a full post before dying down. Stage Three: The user can throw two standard bombs or a single bomb with double radius and duration.														
995	2	6	Voice Manipulation	Tsukurigoe	Enables the user to alter his voice and change it to match someone else. This technique can make the voice of the most innocent girl into a husky man or turn an assassin's voice into the cry of a mother seeking aid for her child. Further, the user knows how to throw his voice, capable of making it emanate from anywhere within ten feet. Stage Three: The user can create any sound, such as a dog's bark or the creaking of floorboards, and can throw his voice up to twenty feet away.														
995	3	1	Diminishing Shadow	Kageheri no Jutsu	The user runs his chakra into shadows, giving him a measure of control over them. With this technique, he can have shadows rear up and strike towards an enemy. However, being immaterial, the shadow cannot inflict any damage and is thus used primarily to confuse or distract an enemy. As such, it does not count as an offensive action on the round it's used. Up to two shadows can be controlled at once.														
995	3	2	Distance Hearing	Tookukiki no Jutsu	The user pours chakra into an object, such as a shuriken, designating it his marker. As long as this technique is active, the user can hear anything that happens around the marker, allowing him to leave his marker out to spy as he hides safely away. These sounds are enhanced, making this jutsu confusing if the user himself is around other sources of noise. Once the user attains the rank of chuunin, he can block out sounds well enough that he's no longer bothered by conflicting sources of sound.														
995	3	3	Shadow Drop	Kageochi no Jutsu	Useful anywhere there's a shadow, the user basically falls backwards or forwards into a shadow. By focusing chakra into the shadow itself, he can lift it off a surface to cover himself, making it appear as if he has vanished into the shadow itself. In actuality, the shadow is bent around him, distorted enough to hide him. This hiding place can be maintained as long as the user focuses and even holds up against enemy attack - though the user may be stabbed through the shadow cover, as long as no one touches the shadow itself, the user is still hidden.														
995	3	4	Shadow Trace	Kagetegakari no Jutsu	A tracking technique that allows the user to transfer a piece of his shadow into another using chakra. To activate this jutsu, the user must be close enough that his shadow overlaps the target, which can be another person's, an animal's, or even an objects. A small shard of his shadow breaks off and hides within the other shadow - once that's happened, the user always knows which direction the target is in and can find his way back to it. This technique may only track one target at a time and the user may recall the shard of his shadow at any time.														
995	3	5	Charlatan's Death	Yashi no Eisei	The user turns their chakra against their own body in a moment of practiced meditation to initiate this technique. This allows them to stop all bodily functions while preserving their health and mind. Blood ceases flowing, heart stops beating, and the body starts to cool. For the duration, all medical tests register the user as dead. In truth, the user is in a coma-like near death state. Ten hours after the technique has been used, the user spasms back to life, provided nothing else has happened to their body in the meantime. Stage Four: The user can now set a time to wake up: the technique lasts anywhere from five minutes to 48 hours.														
995	3	6	Open Slot																
995	4	1	Shadow Prison	Eikangoku no Jutsu	The user charges chakra through his hands and places them open palm on a target's chest. The chakra releases and lifts a spherical shadow around the target, creating a prison. Nothing can get in or out of the shadow, which lasts for a single post, allowing the user time to escape or set up an attack. Stage Five: The prison lasts for two posts.														
995	4	2	Translucent Weapons	Hantoumei na Buki	Focusing chakra around his weapons, the user dampens and alters the reflection of light around them. While not making a weapon entirely transparent, this jutsu makes them much harder to see. This technique is difficult to maintain while attacking, so the user may only keep it active on a single larger weapon, such as a katana, at once. However, up to four small projectiles can be made translucent at once. Stage Five: The user can keep two large weapons translucent or affect up to ten projectiles at once.														
995	4	3	Spirit Diminish	Kiseisaku no Jutsu	By actively focusing on masking his chakra signature, the shinobi can attempt to hide himself in a number of ways. First, he registers as a non-shinobi to any technique that distinguishes shinobi from civilian, whether its mundane or bloodline. Second, as long as he isn't actively attacking, he can mask his presence from any technique that would otherwise reveal him, whether it be by tripping over a chakra string, stepping into a warded area, or by detecting killing intent. As long as the user remains out of combat, all jutsu-based means of detecting him fail. Once the user enters combat, Spirit Diminish eats a jutsu usage for every post that it remains active, even if the user himself is not attacking.														
995	4	4	No Sound	Otonai no Jutsu	The user sets six boundaries with his tags, creating the shape of a cube with a tag on each face. The cube can cover the size of a large room with ease and, while active, does not allow sound to pass the boundary in either direction. This creates a portable safe zone for secret diplomacy, torturers, and parties. The boundaries function as long as the user remains within them and the tags are intact. Stage Five: The user may instead affix the tags directly to his person, creating a ten foot sphere centered around himself. This version of the technique is mobile and lasts for up to three posts before needing to be reactivated.														
995	4	5	Overload	Tsumisugi no Jutsu	This technique allows the user to make all the colors of everything in the area around more vibrant through a stream of chakra exiting the body. Effectively, the user overloads everyone else's senses with intense stimulus - anyone within eyesight who sees the user is blinded and disoriented for a single post. This technique can be kept active for up to three posts, affecting targets multiple times during that duration, but is taxing enough that there is a two post cooldown once the technique ends.														
995	4	6	Open Slot																
995	5	1	Numbing Smoke	Mahi na Kage	Clapping his hands together, the user creates a cloud of vapor that rushes away from him to cover a twenty foot circle around him. The thin smoke is a numbing agent that affects any exposed skin it comes in contact with. A shinobi's ability to function depends on tactile feedback to the point that the numbed sensations create a serious struggle: holding a weapon, forming hand seals, or moving at full speed become extremely difficult. Smoke's effects remain two posts after exposure before fading. Power 24: The poisonous smoke covers thirty-five feet around the user. Power 31: The poisonous smoke covers fifty feet around the user.														
995	5	2	Unseen Step	Minokosu Ippozenshin	The shinobi may move between areas that are not being actively watched instantaneously, as though moving from one place to another in a single step. So long as he can see a place with his own eyes, he can step to it provided no one is watching the end point. Each of these steps takes great care, making them possible only in moments of relative peace - Unseen Step is perfect for infiltration, but impractical to use in combat.														
995	5	3	Fortification	Yosai	The user focuses chakra into a makibishi or other caltrop before tossing it into the air. The caltrop splits and multiplies before hitting the ground, creating dozens of identical pieces of metal, enough to thickly coat a twenty foot square. The caltrops are coated in a poison that does two things once it enters the bloodstream: it distorts the victim's sight and raises the victim's heart rate. While the hazards remain indefinitely, the poison lasts for two posts, but gets worse with each successive dose. Three doses causes near blindness and serious heart strain; more than that can become fatal. Power 25: Creates a thirty foot square. Power 32: Creates a forty foot square. Control 24: The user can walk over the caltrops, standing on their points without sinking onto them. Control 31: The user can bend shadows over the caltrops, rendering them virtually undetectable.														
995	5	4	Dimension Door	Jigen no Tobira	The user cuts away a piece of his own shadow and leaves it dormant within the shadow of anything else. The two shadows are thereafter linked like two sides of the door, allowing the user to send objects through his own shadow and causing them to reappear at the other. Further, the user may entering his own shadow, transporting himself to the second shadow while immediately severing the connection between the two. This technique can be used to completely escape combat, but is the only action the user can take that post if used that way.

995	6	1	Temporary Body Paralysis Technique	Kanashibari no Jutsu	An advanced ninjutsu that's used to temporarily bind a target. The user first weaves his chakra around a weapon, which he must keep in hand for a full post as he prepares the technique. Once prepared, the jutsu activates when the weapon makes contact with a target. The implanted chakra jumps from the weapon into the target's body and immediately paralyzes them completely for two posts. Power 26: The weapon may paralyze twice before the chakra dissipates. Control 26: Targets are paralyzed for two posts, then weakened for an additional two posts.														
995	6	2	Hiding With Camouflage Technique	Meisaigakure no Jutsu	This technique allows the user to blend into the background for as long as the skill is held, even modifying his own skin tone. The user creates a tightly woven net of chakra around his body and changes color and visual texture to disguise himself among his surroundings. While easily used in barren landscapes and at night, the user skilled enough to hide virtually anywhere. As long as this technique is active, the user can only use stage one and two jutsu at the same time. Intelligence 28: The user can use stage three jutsu while still hiding. Tactics 27: The user can extend his chakra net, hiding a single additional person at the same time.														
995	6	3	Revelation	Araidasu	The user emits a pulse of chakra that spreads out over a two hundred foot radius, moving through walls. This pulse lingers and detects other living humans, creating a kind of sonar. Additionally, the user is able to separate shinobi, samurai, and other chakra-users within the radius from non-users, allowing them to tell both number and direction in relation to himself. The pulse lasts for three posts before it must be refreshed, but continues to provide feedback within those posts.														
995	6	4	Dark Room	Anshitu	An especially complicated ritual, Anshitu begins with the user outlining a door on any flat surface wholly of sealing tags. The process is slow, painstaking and includes extended calculations of space and parameters of the world that the human mind was not built to comprehend. Once done, they fill the 'door' with their shadow, and the shadow becomes a true doorway to the user's own personal storage area. Their own square room, five meters in every direction. Each shinobi has their own uses for it. Some warriors store entire arsenals of weapons, insidious doctors hide patients, corpses and forbidden experiments while hunters are known for using it as a makeshift prison. The only limits are the user's imagination. This is a non-combat technique.

995	7	1	Transcendent Imitation	Koutou Gisei	This jutsu allows for the complete and utter imitation of another person. They must acquire some part of the subject they wish to imitate, picked within a day, in order for it to work. After a long series of seals they close the jutsu and adopt their target's form and body flawlessly, and may maintain it until they wish for it to end or until they die. They retain a shadow of the person's memories, allowing them a rough guideline from which to judge their subject's mannerisms and their relations with other persons on a daily basis, including names, faces and usual routines, though the intricate details are lost to them. This jutsu does not convey knowledge of specific jutsu or shinobi techniques that the subject knew and the user did not.														
995	7	2	Mental Passenger	Norite Sakai	Given an hour to work with a subject, the user places a sealing tag on their forehead, rests their palm upon it and lets this jutsu wash over them. Over this hour, a second self is lodged firmly in the back of the subject's mind. It can, if it chooses, attempt to spur them onward toward certain actions or simply wait in the back of their mind, observing. When the technique is done, the subject is disorientated by the experience and unable to accurately recall the last couple of hours. If the user ever uses this technique again on someone who has already been subject to it, they can pluck information about everything the subject has experienced from the mental passenger, using the subject as a sort of unwitting spy.

995	7	5	Making Nobody	Kamumeishi	Clapping their hands together after a complicated series of handseals, the user causes a sudden reaction in the air that spreads to cover the area of a small town. All those within this area, enemies, allies and bystanders alike, have a sudden and drastic change in perception. They are rendered unable to distinguish any person from another through faces, body-type, clothing worn or even the sound of their voices. Every person is made anonymous. It takes around a day for those afflicted to work the effects of the jutsu out of their system.														
995	7	6	Open Slot																
993	1	1	Super Beast Imitation Drawing	Chouju Giga no Jutsu	A single creation no larger than a fist is drawn and animated. This creation is flat as a sheet of paper but can look like anything. The creation can only move along surfaces, ignoring gravity, and cannot 'jump' or otherwise move three-dimensionally. It may attack whatever surface it is currently on (including living surfaces) with kunai-like sharpness and with Level 1 Physical levels. The creation lasts until hit by any attack, and will disintegrate completely if any liquid touches it. Lasts 1 post. Base Effect: +1 post duration OR +1 creation made per usage. Stage Two: +1 Strength OR +1 Speed Stage Three: +1 hits taken OR liquid does not cause it to dissolve.														
993	1	2	Face Paint	Kumadori no Jutsu	The artist gains a permanent tattoo somewhere on their face, the form of which is up to the artist but which must be in plain sight for the jutsu to function. After consuming a usage and touching the tattoo to activate it, a distinct but clearly artificial pattern covers the head, body, and clothes. This completely disguises the voice and identity of the user, but they will also look and sound unnatural as they will appear like an oil painting come to life. This effect extends to any items being held as well. Lasts for 3 posts, but may be extended by at no action cost for 1 post by consuming another Stage One usage. Base Stage: The effect lasts until: the artist is hit by any attack OR the artist attacks or uses any jutsu. Stage Two: While standing still the artist: shimmers as if they possessed the Glow modifier OR the technique's duration is extended by 1 post.														
993	1	3	Copy	Gizo	A stylized version of an object, animal, or person is drawn on a flat surface and from the original drawing a three-dimensional figure will climb out. Any cursory examination will reveal the creation to be an ink drawing and not the real thing. Each copy has Level 1 Physical stats but cannot wield items or perform complex tasks. The copy will dissipate after attacking or being hit by any attack. Each post, including the first post the original drawing is made, another copy will climb out from the original drawing. Copies born of the original drawing last 1 post, while the original drawing itself produces copies for 3 posts. Any attack destroys the original drawing, and all copies fall apart when the original drawing is destroyed. Base Effect: +1 post duration: for the clones OR for the original drawing. Stage Two: Clones receive: +1 Strength OR +1 Speed Stage Three: Upon death each clone splashes ink in a 5 foot radius OR +1 clone formed per post.														
993	1	4	Air Writing	Soragaki	Ink may be drawn in midair and retain a semi-solid existence, similar to that of hard paper or cardboard. This can support the weight of a single person provided they move very slowly but otherwise provides no defensive protection, and is clearly ink in nature. Art given solid form this way follows the same rules as anything else, IE floating platforms or other impossible geometry will collapse. Any drawings outside 10 feet of the Artist instantly disintegrate, and any attack which hits the ink causes the whole structure to fall apart. Base Effect: Art lasts 1 post after leaving the Artist's range OR +10 feet of range. Stage Three: Art can move around at Level 1 Speed but otherwise has no physical statsOR art can support the weight of 4 people and can be moved on at half Speed. Stage Five: Art created this way can survive 2 hits OR can have Level 2 physical stats.														
993	1	5	The Four Treasures of the Study: Brush	Bunbo Shiho: Fude	The first of four ancient calligraphy artifacts, a rare Fude comes into the possession of the fledgling artist while learning their craft. The golden Fude is a six inch long brush whose silver bristles are from an unknown source, but are rumored to be the hair of a long dead Kirin. Any jutsu painted with the Fude brush is incredibly taxing, costing every remaining usage in that Stage plus all usages in the Stages used to scale. For each usage consumed this way, that jutsu may be used an additional time in that post. Base Effect: Only Stage One jutsu may be painted Stage Three: Stage Three and below jutsu may be painted Stage Five: Stage Five and below jutsu may be painted														
993	1	6	The Diamond Sutra	Sutra: Kongo-Kyo	The Kongo-Kyo is a well-known historical account of a famous monk who discovers emptiness. Writing the lengthy sutra is a laborious process, which requires a full post of attention with no other actions being taken. After completion, the mind of the artist is completely cleared, and no more jutsu or taijutsu (along with taijutsu bonuses) may be used for the rest of the thread. In this pure state of emptiness and with no more preconceptions about the world around them, the artist is truly a blank slate. The artist may use any basic Archetype Special for the rest of the thread. Up to 2 specials may be used per post, but each type of special can only be used once in the thread. Any 'once per character' or 'once per lifetime' specials cannot be used this way. Base Effect: Basic Archetype Specials can be used Stage Three: Combo Archetype Specials can be used. Stage Five: Unique archetype specials of targets in the thread can be used.														
993	2	1	Rumormill	Uwasa	A seal is drawn on up to four surfaces, usually on easy to handle slips of paper or scrolls. Anything drawn or written on one seal appears on all seals. Lasts for the duration of the thread, or until any seal is destroyed, which causes all Uwasa seals to disintegrate. Base Effect: The seal can be read just by touching it OR words may be added to the seal just by touching it and thinking. Stage Four: Uwasa seals: always show arrows on the seal pointing to other active seals OR automatically transcribe all sounds that reach it.														
993	2	2	Continuous Eyes	Mokumokuren	A unique symbol, sometimes called a 'tag', is drawn onto a surface. When the artist presses their head against the tag they may receive information from a matching tag in the thread that is no more than a mile away. However, this can only be done when both tags are stationary. Other senses are disabled while remotely accessing the tag. Up to 3 tags may exist in a thread. Tags last until destroyed by any attack. Creating a tag does not consume a usage, only using it does. Base Effect: Tags transmit: visual information OR audio information. Stage Three: Allies may draw usable tags OR the artist may retain one other sense while accessing a tag.														
993	2	3	Epitaph	Hibun	A monster no larger than a horse is drawn and animated, and given a single target to hunt. A piece of the target must be given to the monster for it to function, such as a lock of hair or a blood sample. The monster's Physical Levels are equal to the highest Stage known in this list +2. However the monster is mindless and cannot be controlled, such that it only moves in the shortest path between itself and its target, and only when the original target is within eyesight of the Artist. Otherwise it remains perfectly still and limp. Lasts 3 posts. Base Effect: The monster also cannot move or attack if: the target sees it OR the target holds their breath.														
993	2	4	Squid Tentacle	Ika Shokushu no Jutsu	A three-foot long streak of ink is etched onto a consenting individual and takes a form similar to a tattoo. Usually this is in the form of something long and thin like vines, roots, or tentacles. Anything hostile that touches the affected individual then has the tattoo jump to life and try to entangle the hostile target, spraying them with inky strings that function much like a net. The net acts as though it is alive and writhes and knots itself to make escape difficult. The tattoo itself lasts 2 posts after its creation, and the net 1 post after the tattoo is activated. The tattoo can be activated multiple times during its duration, equal to the number of usages the Artists chooses to consume the post of its creation. The net can be cut or removed with any Level 2 Strength attack or any Stage One or higher ninjutsu. Base Effect: +1 post duration of the tattoo OR +1 tattoo activation. Stage Three: Net binds with +2 Strength Levels OR the tattoo can be placed on non-living surfaces. Stage Four: Tentacles constrict and choke targets while active OR can be barbed or coated in thorns.														
993	2	5	Seal Script	Tensho	Tensho is an ancient calligraphy style used to denote titles, usually of royalty or power. A permanent tattoo is acquired of the artist's name, or what they believe or want their name to be, anywhere on their person. By running their hand over the tattoo and charging it with chakra the artist may instantly swap places with any ink ninjutsu they've created, so long as it is in eyesight and approximately equal to their own size. Doing so consumes a kawarimi usage. Base Effect: the artist is unable to use any ink ninjutsu in the following post after the swap OR both kawarimi usages are consumed instead. Stage Three: One additional target may be brought along OR One additional swap may occur in the same post.														
993	2	6	Perfection of Wisdom Sutra	Hannya-Haramitta	The Hannya-Haramitta is an enormous, 8000 line sutra which would take a normal person weeks to properly copy. This sutra covers the stories of an alleged deity who lectured their disciples about the concept of understanding. For every post the Artist remains stationary and uses their full action to write this sutra down, any active ink jutsu with Physical Levels have +1 Strength and Speed, and any allies with the Artist's ink on them gains a similar boost. As soon as the artist ceases writing or is forced to move, the bonuses are lost and all of their active ink jutsu are immediately destroyed. In addition the Artist suffers a -1 penalty to all Physical Levels for the rest of the thread (to a minimum of 1). Base Effect: After 2 posts while maintaining this sutra, ink jutsu gain an additional: +1 Speed OR +1 Strength														
993	3	1	Beginning Stroke	Shihitsu	At the start of a thread, the Artist may already have a tattoo somewhere on their person with a sealed ink ninjutu within it. This ink ninjutsu can be used once at any point in the thread without needing to draw anything or use hand seals. Only ink ninjutsu up to Stage Five may be sealed this way.														
993	3	2	Spraying Ink	Mizusashi	A single ink jutsu created by the artist within 25 feet may be exploded with the force of an explosive pouch. This immediately ends whatever jutsu was being used on that ink. Base Stage: Itching, irritating ink is splattered in a 10 foot radius of the explosion OR an ink cloud is generated similar in size and duration to a smoke grenade. Stage Four: Up to three targets at once may be exploded OR one target within eyesight explodes with the force of an explosive tag.														
993	3	3	Wall Scroll	Kakejiku	A permanent tattoo is gained by the artist in any style, though usually it is of a favorite manga character. By charging it with chakra the user may merge into a flat surface and appear as a flat, cartoon-like version of themselves. While in this ink form, the user can see and hear, but may only move along the flat surface and cannot traverse three-dimensional space. Gravity still affects them to a limited degree, and any liquid will wash out the ink and cause them to pop back into three-dimensional form. Only ink ninjutsu may be used in this form. They still sustain normal damage while in this ink form, but taking a hit won't end the technique. Lasts 3 posts. Base Effect: While under this effect, the Artist has: No taijutsu bonuses OR no access to items. Stage Four: The artist may shrink to the size of a rat OR the artist may hide within their existing ink ninjutsu. Stage Five:: +3 post duration OR a temporary tattoo, with all effects, may be placed on consenting individuals														
993	3	4	Gold Seal of the King	Kinin no Jutsu	Despite its elaborate name, this technique is a simple seal that is drawn onto an existing item in the artist's inventory. The item is then consumed and melts into ink, and cannot be used for the rest of the thread. From the ink emerges a shimmering, golden version of the artist, wielding the consumed item. The golden clone has the same stats (including bonuses) as the artist and can use any taijutsu they know, apart from special techniques that require chakra. The artist cannot attack or use jutsu while the golden clone is active and have all their physical levels reduced to 1 for the duration. In addition the artist feels the pain of attacks sustained by the clone and is completely paralyzed for 1 post after the clone is destroyed. The technique lasts until the golden clone takes a fatal hit, or for a number of posts equal to the cost of the sacrificed item. Can only be used once per thread. Base Stage: The golden clone: only possesses sight, and no other senses OR can only move when the user remains still, and visa versa.														
993	3	5	The Four Treasures of the Study: Ink	Bunbo Shiho: Sumi	Somewhere along their studies the artist has come upon and acquired the second of four ancient calligraphy arts, the legendary Sumi. This ink is said to have originally been harvested from a divine deep sea creature. No matter how often the artist dips into it, it never seems to run out, however chakra must be consumed to draw it out. By consuming a usage each post, all ink jutsu used in that same post gain an additional effect. Art drawn or words written with Sumi ink glisten with an unnatural aura unique to each Artist. Base Effect: Ink jutsu drawn with this ink: acts as hallucinogenic poison OR tear gas. Stage Four: When an ink jutsu is destroyed: it detonates in a blinding flash OR screams out with a deafening pitch.														
993	3	6	The Passing of the Lantern Sutra	Denkoroku	The Denkoroku is a collection of biographies of a famous lineage of fifty-three monks and the lessons learned through their lives, mostly centering on the theme of awareness. It is said that reciting the Denkoroku puts one in touch with the ancestor's spirits. This sutra is written onto a scroll or sheet, which then forms a detailed map of its surroundings on the opposite side. The map continuously updates while it is in the Artist's possession, and anyone who touches the map has a small indicator of their location printed onto it as well, tracking them for its duration. The map only shows strictly physical boundaries and only things that the Artist themself can observe, and doesn't reveal secret or hidden information. The map lasts until it is damaged or until the Artist wills it to stop working. 1 map is created per usage, and additional usages may be used in the same post to create up to 3 more. Base Effect: Hostile targets within sight of those holding maps show up on the map OR once per thread, outside of combat map holders may switch places with anyone else holding map.														
993	4	1	Ink Smithing	Kajiya no Jutsu	A drawing of a weapon, no larger than its real counterpart, can be placed on any immobile surface. If a target sets off the trigger anywhere within range of the drawing it springs to life and jumps off the surface, charging at the target with Level 5 Physical stats. After it attacks, the weapon splashes into a puddle of ink. Weapons drawn with this technique can remain ready to activate indefinitely after performing this technique but last only a single post after animating. Base Effect:: The jutsu trigger is: any sound in a 20 foot radius OR any motion that passes directly in front of it within 40 feet. Stage Five: The weapon may persist and continue attacking for 1 more post OR dozens of weapons may be launched at once, all aimed at the same target.														
993	4	2	Paperweight	Bunchin	A scroll is unraveled and slammed into the ground, with the paper within the scroll extending out no farther than 20 feet. An ink wall in the style of the Artist's choosing erupts out from the scroll. Breaking through the bounding area requires Level Six Strength or Level Four ninjutsu (or greater). Climbing on the walls through chakra aided means is impossible, though traditional methods can still work. Stage Five: Requires Level 10 Strength OR Stage Five Ninjutsu to break.														
993	4	3	Landscape	Sansuiga	After throwing out a large scroll, the paper unfolds into a 6 by 6 foot wide sheet. The Artist then very quickly draws onto the sheet a stylistic approximation of their surroundings. When finished the large scroll splits in two, leaving an exact copy at the location where it was drawn. The original rolls back up and can be carried around. At any point for the rest of the thread, the scroll can be unraveled and any person may then 'step' into this painting (or otherwise be forced into it) and transported through it to the other painting. Only one person or object may be transported this way per post. Both paintings operate on the same system, so one may transport objects in either direction this way. Transferring a person or object this way consumes a usage of the artist each time someone passes through it, and the scrolls fall apart if either take any damage at all.														
993	4	4	Miniaturized Beast Drawing	Chouju Chibi no Jutsu	A multitude of small creations are drawn and animated at once in a large swarm, which cannot be any larger than a rat in size. The swarm has Level 2 Physical stats, but gains 1 Level in all Physical stats each post. Lasts 3 posts. Base Effect: The creations may fly OR have +2 Physical Levels Stage Five: The swarm gains +1 Physical Level per post OR +2 post duration.														
993	4	5	Clerical Script	Reishotai no Jutsu	A style of calligraphy notorious for its use in keeping track of slaves, Reishotai scripture takes the form of a permanent tattoo of their birth country's name, or failing that any design that symbolizes where they believe their home is or was. By charging the tattoo with chakra and then touching a target, a written log of that target's actions appears on the Artist's palms. Some people call these detailed paragraphs of text 'posts', for reasons that aren't clear. The log is in the style of a narrative from the target's point of view and varies in usefulness. Effectively allows the artist to 'read' the literal text of the previous post of the target, or otherwise gain a general idea as to their location by a reading short narrative. The written text updates each post with new information. Lasts 3 posts. Stage Five: +2 post duration OR targets can be tracked by touching a blood sample instead.														
993	4	6	Vow Sutra	Torei Zenji	The Torei Zenji is a sutra recited by students which is a series of promises and statements to remain dutiful even in the face of adversity. By copying this sutra the artist diverts their attention away from negative thoughts and focuses on what they must accomplish. After copying this sutra onto a scroll, each time the artist sustains an injury, half of the pain they normally would feel is transferred to the scroll instead. This pain sealing lasts for 3 posts, however the scroll remains intact at the conclusion of the technique for the duration of the thread. Any target who damages or destroys the scroll releases the sealed pain onto themselves for that post. Stage Five: Allies may recite the sutra while the Artist is copying it, which includes them under its effect.														
993	5	1	Super Beast Imitation Drawing - Advanced	Chouju Giga no Jutsu: Biribiri Ongaku	Art larger than a human but no larger an elephant may be drawn and animated. These creations still only weigh as much as the ink they are drawn with, however, and cannot possess more than Level 3 Physical stats. An additional 4 Physical Levels may be distributed to Strength or Speed at creation as well. All creations are destroyed after 3 posts, or after they sustain a direct hit. These creations cannot be used as mounts, as anyone trying to ride one will simply fall through the liquid ink. Base Stage:: +1 Physical Levels OR creations can take 1 additional hit. Control 24: +2 post duration OR 2 creations can be drawn at once. Control 31: +2 Physical Levels OR ink creations may be ridden on for transportation.														
993	5	2	Massive Beast Drawing	Kaiju no Jutsu	A massive monster is drawn onto a flat surface, and then animated. The beast is so large it can't be drawn in one post, and requires the Artist to continue drawing it each post after activation to increase its size and shape. If the Artist is forced to stop drawing at any time, the jutsu ends. The kaiju starts with base dimensions of 10 by 10 by 10 and Level 4 in all Physical stats. It's size increases by 10 feet and also increases by 4 Physical Levels each post for a maximum of 12. Any Stage Five ninjutsu or attack higher than its own Physical Level destroys it. Base Stage: The kaiju can release powerful jets of ink from its mouth OR explode on death into an ocean of ink. Intelligence 24: The kaiju can at half Speed: fly OR burrow underground or swim through water														
993	5	3	Arrangement	Hairetsu	Any jutsu which the Artist has observed in the thread or knows themselves can be used as an ink version instead. The ink copy is mostly harmless apart from splashing some ink on those it hits. Copying the technique this way does not teach the actual technique to the Artist, although they may continue copying it for the remainder of the thread. Copied genjutsu make the illusion visible, but in ink form and with no other effects. The ink copy lasts as long as the actual technique would have, and falls apart into ink once finished.														
993	5	4	Inclined Production Mode	Keisha Seisan Hoshiki	Some artists take their sweet time, but others have strict deadlines. The Artist gains a permanent tattoo of a clock or timer, which begins to count down once it is charged with chakra. The timer counts down starting on the post in which it is used and finishing at the end of the next post. Once the timer is finished it begins counting back up, and no taijutsu or jutsu may be used while it is doing so. Base Effect: While counting down: active ink jutsu take all damage the Artist would have instead OR all ink jutsu cannot take damage.														
993	5	5	The Four Treasures of the Study: Paper	Bunbo Shiho: Washi	The third of four ancient calligraphy arts, Washi is the canvas which the artist transforms into works of art. The Washi is an ephemeral, hair thin sheet of parchment, drawn from a scroll that never seems to get smaller. The Washi is said to have been pressed from the petals of a flower that blooms once a century. By consuming a usage the Artist can modify all ink jutsu used in that post with an additional effect. Ink creations drawn on Washi can poof out of existence at the Artist's command and lay dormant for 1 post before reappearing, extending their duration by that amount. Ink ninjutsu drawn onto Washi seem to fade into and out of existence, as if they were not of this world at all. Base Effect: Ink jutsu may lay dormant for up to 3 posts OR ink jutsu may pop back into existence anywhere within eyesight.														
993	5	6	Mind Sutra	Shushogi	Considered a 'common' sutra that is much derided for focusing on practical matters, the Shushogi sutra encourages meditations on thoughtfulness. Copying this sutra onto a scroll focuses the emotional state of nearby beings (human or otherwise) to manifest, causing their specific thoughts and feelings to materialize in the ink itself. All intelligent beings (including bunshin/constructs) within 50 feet of the written sutra display their current thoughts in black ink over their head. This includes any actions which they are about to take. Any target higher in rank than the artist is immune from the effect, but will still have a question mark appear above them to indicate this. Lasts until the sutra is destroyed. Base Effect: the Artist is immune to the effect OR +50 feet range.														
993	6	1	Intrinsic Clone	Jissai Bunshin no Jutsu	A special seal is drawn on the forehead, and then the artist seems to split from themselves to form into a pair of ink-marked likenesses, with the original artist nowhere to be found. Both clones have the full stats of the original and can use any jutsu apart from this one. Both clones are identical- in fact, they are one and the same, a perfectly balanced mix of ink and chakra that makes them indistinguishable even to powerful doujutsu. That is because neither one is the 'real' one. The one which gets hit first will poof into a puddle of ink, and the survivor will be the new 'original'. Base Stage: Both clones share sensory information OR if both clones are hit in the same post, one may completely ignore the damage.														
993	6	2	Forced Heartbeat	Chikara Dokidoki	By unraveling a prepared scroll and hitting a target with it, whatever parts of the target hit the scroll are forced into the scroll as a flat drawing. This can trap multiple targets, as the scroll is 10 feet long and wide. Limbs which are stuck partially in the scroll can still move but only along the flat surfaces they touch. If the scroll is damaged, any body parts on the damaged part of the scroll are hurt as well. Lasts 2 posts. Base Effect: +2 post duration OR +20 feet of scroll in both directions.														
993	6	3	Vertical Stroke	Tatekaku	A pair of thin ink designs are drawn, usually on the back of a target. The design cannot be smaller than 6 feet each. These function as temporary wings, which allow the wearer to fly at their base Speed Levels with no bonuses. This flight may be maintained indefinitely so long as the wings are intact, however the thin ink used will break if struck by any attack. Multiple pairs of wings can be drawn on a single target, consuming a usage for each pair drawn. Base Effect: Wings may produce a blast of wind OR wings may survive 1 extra hit.														
993	6	4	Pressure	Hitsuatsu	A painting of a target currently in eyesight is done. In addition to drawing the target, the Artist also illustrates the target with a wound. The wounded painting then leaps to life and chases after the target with Level 9 Speed. If the painting touches the original target the two will merge, and the original target will suffer the wound as it was painted. If the painting is attacked during its charge then any additional wounds it sustains will also be transferred to the target. Only a lethal attack will cause the painting to completely dissipate. Base Effect: The painting can kawarimi once OR the painting can wall walk.														
993	6	5	Cursive Script	Sosho no Jutsu	The most difficult to write and read among the scripts, cursive is the common name for writing which uses more freeform, curved styles compared to the rigidity seen elsewhere in the calligraphy arts. A highly stylized word of phrase is permanently tattooed onto the artist, which can be activated by touching it and charging it with chakra. The artist may then merge with any ink creation currently active in the thread, adding that creation's abilities and weakness to their own, and replacing their own physical levels with that of the ink creation. Ink jutsu may not be used for the duration, but other techniques are allowed. When the duration of the merged ink technique ends the artist takes a stat penalty equal to any bonuses gained for 2 posts, which will render them unconscious for the rest of the thread if the penalty drops them below level 1. Only 1 ink jutsu may be merged at a time. 3 post cooldown. Base Effect: Merged ink jutsu have 1 more post of duration OR merged ink jutsu can take 1 more hit than normal.														
993	6	6	Heart Sutra	Hannya Shingyo	The most famous of the sutra, the Heart sutra is a philosophical chant which focuses on the form of the material world. This sutra may only be copied onto a scroll properly when the Artist has no more Stage Five or Six usages remaining. A revelation of a truth about the world touches the Artist, modifying all their ink ninjutsu for the rest of the thread or until the scroll the sutra was copied too is destroyed. Base Effect: All ink ninjutsu occur twice per usage OR all ink ninjutsu use BOTH scaling options.														
993	7	1	Gate of Heaven	Tengoku no Torii	This technique can only be used after the Artist spends an entire post drawing an exquisitely perfect illustration of anything of their choice, so long as the drawing itself is only as large as a normal sheet of paper. From that point on anyone who gets a good, intentional look at the drawing is a valid target for this technique. A conscious action is written onto the target, typically something short and easy to understand. The writing instantly fades and for the next 3 posts if the affected target attempts or tries to attempt the command, their body is overcome with a paralyzing amount of pain. The target is completely aware of what was written on them. Actions must be something the target chooses to do (IE, not automatic bodily functions like breathing or blinking). The drawing may last the entire thread (along with its effect) or until it is destroyed. Base Effect: +1 post duration OR the drawing can be done in midair and effects anyone looking at the Artist, but disappears immediately after.														
993	7	2	Eternal Portrait	Gurei no Shouzou	The artist draws a life-sized picture of themselves on any surface. Any damage the Artist would take after that point is instead absorbed and copied onto the portrait. Mental damage (such as from genjutsu) or stat penalties still occur normally. If the portrait is ever more than a mile away from the Artist, or if the artist themselves ever look at it, then it immediately disintegrates. When the portrait is destroyed by any means the Artist receives all the absorbed damage at once. If the artist would die from an injury absorbed by the portrait, then their death is delayed until the technique is released. May be used on consenting individuals, which makes them the 'Artist' for the purposes of this technique. The portrait is immune to any normal physical damage. Only Stage Seven ninjutsu or chakra based special techniques can destroy it. The portrait cannot be combined with any other ink jutsu. Base Effect: Only Ink ninjutsu can be used while the portrait is active OR portrait defenses drop by 1 Stage each post.														
993	7	3	Tattoo Technique	Irezumo no Jutsu	Quite adept at making their own tattoos, the Artist branches out into inking the soul itself. A seal is drawn in midair, which then seems to fade away and disappear. Whenever a person other than the artist stays within 250 feet of the seal for one post, they gain a temporary copy of a unique seal of the artist's design on their forehead. For the remainder of the thread, any target bearing this seal has their own stats, techniques, archetypes, and seals replaced by the Artist's. Those affected may use any jutsu or fighting styles known by the Artist, with the same stats, but have no access to any of their original jutsu, styles, seals, or abilities.														
993	7	4	Proliferate	Zoshoku Suru no Jutsu	An ink copy of every living creature or construct within eyesight is created at once, which appears identical to the originals. Copies have the same Physical levels as the originals, the same items, and fight with the same taijutsu styles (including bonuses) and special techniques, but cannot use ninjutsu or genjutsu. Copies last until they sustain a normally fatal blow or for 3 posts, but otherwise do not feel pain. Base Effect: Copies explode like an explosive tag on command or death OR copies regenerate from nonlethal damage after 1 post.														
993	7	5	The Four Treasures of the Study: Inkstone	Bunbo Shiho: Suzuri	The fourth of four ancient calligraphy arts, Suzuri is the holding receptacle from which ink is drawn. The legendary Suzuri is in fact a mummified piece of a body of a dead ink ninjutsu master, which is ingested by the now master Artist to gain its power and continue the cycle. Instead of blood, the artist now bleeds black ink. Once per thread, at no cost, when the artist loses a significant amount of blood they may perform any ink jutsu they know in the following post at-will, without having to paint or use hand seals. Additionally, once per thread, at the cost of a Stage Seven usage, when the artist's life is in danger they will automatically use any Stage Six or below ink ninjutsu at no additional usage or action cost. If unconscious or otherwise unable to respond intelligently, the jutsu will direct itself in the most useful way to protect the life of the artist.														
993	7	6	Lotus Sutra	Myoho Renge Kyo	The Lotus sutra is an esoteric book more focused on abstract ideas about unity between all things. The Lotus sutra can only be used after one ink jutsu from each of the first six Stages has been used in the thread. Once the sutra is copied onto a surface, ink tendrils begin to sprout and spread from it. Over the course of two posts a 250 foot radius area becomes coated in inky roots, including anyone standing on or touched by the growing ink. At the end of the final post every affected area, living or nonliving, is sucked in towards the origin point and sealed up in a long scroll, leaving a large void in its place. Things sealed inside the scroll can be released later only by the original artist, but are otherwise lost for good.														
992	1	1	Popper		A small, pea sized ball of wax is formed. This wax explodes when exposed to strong, sudden forces, such as on impact after being thrown. Pops like a firecracker, causing same amount of damage and noise. 1 popper is formed per usage, plus 1 more popper for each wax jutsu already used in the thread. Stage Two: Poppers can start small flames where they detonate. Stage Three: Poppers can emulate any short, one second long noise the user wishes. Stage Four: Poppers can grow tiny spider legs and move at level 2 Speed for 2 posts.														
992	1	2	Replica		A wax replica of an inanimate object, complete with accurate color, texture, size, and weight can be created. It takes 1 post to make anything up to the size of a normal human, with an additional post required for anything bigger, up to the size of a horse. The replica is inert and nothing more than a wax statue. The replica will fall apart if struck by an offensive action. Replicas possess no combat functionality (cannot be used as weapons), but can retain functionality based on their shape IE a replica key will still unlock a lock, a replica scroll will contain all the information of the scroll, a replica rope could still be climbed on. Stage Two: Replicas can be created from any fragment of an object or person (such as from a hair or blood sample) Stage Three: Replicas can have a 1-point modifier. Stage Four: Replicas can have a 2-point modifier or 2 1-point modifiers.														
992	1	3	Sealant		Sticky, slimy wax can be excreted on the skin and spread on a surface, acting like superglue. Enough is created to coat both palms though it can be secreted anywhere on the body. The glue can hold up to the user's weight. The glue sticks fast, so while this could be used to stick to a wall, it is useless for climbing one. Binds with level 1 Strength, plus 1 more level of Strength for every Wax jutsu used in the previous post. Lasts two posts. Stage Three: Sealant glue can be used to grant an existing object the Repair modifier once per thread. Stage Five: A square foot of sealant glue can be formed on any existing wax jutsu in sight.														
992	1	4	Waxupuncture		Simple, 0 cost projectiles can be formed at the fingertips from wax. These objects can be sharp but will only cut or sustain an attack once before flaking apart. A handful of projectiles can be made per usage. Stage Two: Projectiles may be formed and launched at the user's regular Strength and Speed levels, from any wax source in eyesight. Stage Three: Wax projectiles gain 1 Level of Speed for every Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	1	5	Wax Seal		The user's own jutsu may be sealed inside wax tags for later use. These jutsu then activate on the user's command, or when certain triggers (tripwires, pressure plates, noise, a single half-hand seal, etc) are met. This consumes 2 usages of the Stage of the sealed jutsu, and 1 usage of this jutsu. Only techniques lower in Stage than the highest known in this list may be sealed. Sealed jutsu only last 3 posts, and if not released before then, the usages are wasted.														
992	1	6	Open Slot																
992	2	1	Thumper		A large, multi-layered ball of wax the size of a baseball is created. The thumper explodes once per post for multiple posts with a loud, deep baboom. Each blast possesses the force of an explosive pouch. Thumper blasts spray hot wax in their 5 meter radius, which can cause small blisters on exposed skin. Thumpers can be destroyed by any mundane attack. Lasts 2 posts. Gains 1 meter of radius for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	2	2	Candlemaker		A piece of wax in eyesight may be ignited. This fire is not chakra aided. It is merely mundane fire brought forth and sustained by the wax. These flames may be put out by regular means. The fire, and any other fires that are caused by the original flame, can be extinguish by the user at any time. All fires extinguish after 3 posts. Stage Three: Two fires may be started simultaneously Stage Four: Four fires may be started simultaneously Stage Five: All wax within eyesight may be ignited at once.														
992	2	3	Webslinger		A stream of sticky wax is shot from the mouth or fingers, as if from a water pistol. The wax hardens in midair and behaves like a spider's web, sticking to whoever or whatever it touches next. Enough string can be shot in one blast to produce an entire 'net' worth of string, approximately 3 meters in radius. The string has the durability of a cloth rope and only binds with level 1 Strength level. Each additional Wax jutsu used in the previous post increases its Strength by 1. Lasts 3 posts or until destroyed. Stage Three: The radius of the web increases by 1 meter for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post. Stage Four: Web durability is equivalent to a metal chain.														
992	2	4	Doll		Requirements : TACTICS 6, WILLPOWER 5, CONTROL 5 A mobile, doll-sized, cartoonish copy of a person is created from wax. A tissue sample (blood, skin, hair, etc) is needed from the individual for this technique to work. If a person touching the doll closes their eyes and focuses they can enter a dream-like state where they control the doll as if it were alive. Anything that could be heard or seen by the doll can also be heard or seen by the person. The doll's stats are all 1. The doll falls inert after 3 posts, requiring the consumption of another usage to reactivate it. Dolls can be as small as a finger to as big as a house cat. Stage Three: The doll may use Stage One Wax jutsus known by the controller. Stage Four: The doll may detonate at any time with the force of an explosive tag. This deafens the controller of the doll for 1 post. Stage Five: Dolls possess 1 in all stats, but gain full taijutsu bonuses of the person it was made from, including miniature versions of the weapons used for that style.														
992	2	5	Item Seal		A single or group of items may be locked away into a wax seal. These items must be inert and nonliving. At any time the items may be released by the user of the seal, or if the seal is destroyed. Items sealed inside the wax may also be launched out all at once, at the same Speed and Strength levels the user could have thrown them at. Passively, any items the user possesses may already be locked inside of seals at the start of the thread. Base Effect: Seals an item or items up to the size of a backpack Stage Three: Seals an item or items up to the size of a wheelbarrow Stage Four: Seals an item or items up to the size of a closet														
992	2	6	Open Slot																
992	3	1	Bangbang		A hand-grenade sized ball of wax is formed. A few moments after being thrown the wax explodes. The first blast is equal to an explosive pouch, which sends flecks of hot wax in all directions. Each wax fragment then detonates again when it hits a surface, with the force and heat of a firecracker. Those closer to the impact site of the first blast taking more damage than those farther away, with the maximum range of the blast extending 10 meters. Stage Four: For each Wax jutsu used in the previous post, the radius extends another 5 meters. Stage Five: For each Wax jutsu used in the previous post, another grenade can be formed and thrown in the same post.														
992	3	2	Taxidermist		Forms a mobile, automated construct of wax in the shape of a small animal, no larger than a house cat. The copy can be made any color or shape, but will always look like wax. This animal possesses Level One Physical stats. It may scamper or slither up walls or ceilings, 'melt' through small gaps, and can deliver recorded messages (said aloud during its creation) or items that fit inside it. Can be created with small, sharp teeth that cannot do more than scratch a person but may chew through soft objects given one post. Lasts 3 posts, plus 1 more post if a Wax jutsu was used in the previous post.														
992	3	3	Growth		Small 'seeds' of wax are formed at the fingertips, which are then placed on a surface. Over the course of the same post a magnificent white plant will grow from the seed, the form of which is up to the user but is usually in the shape of a tree. The plant grows no more than 6 feet high and wide, and at the end of its growth a variety of colorful and lifelike fruits will sprout from the tips of its stems. These fruits are tasteless, dry, and difficult to eat, requiring an entire post to properly ingest a single one. Anyone who does so can use an extra jutsu for 1 post, consuming the user's usages rather than their own in the process. If the user consumes their own fruit then once in the thread they may use a wax jutsu without needing hand seals. 1 fruit is grown on the wax tree for every Stage known in this list.														
992	3	4	Gag		A large ball of wax is formed in the mouth and held there. The heat of the ball is enough to burn skin and cause blisters even through clothing or armor. The ball can be spat out at the user's Speed levels or smashed in the mouth. In both cases it sprays hot wax in all directions. The radius of the splashing wax is 1 meter, and the maximum range it can be spat is 2 meters. If a Wax jutsu was used in the previous post, its maximum range is increased to 20 meters. The user is immune to their own waxes' effects. The wax remains hot for 2 posts. Stage Four: The wax gag, when spat, will strike with the user's Strength levels as well. Stage Five: The wax gag may be formed inside an unwilling target's mouth if the user maintains physical contact for an entire post. The target is not immune to the ball's heat.														
992	3	5	Limiter Seal		A simple wax seal the size of a coin is formed, which then must be placed on a target to activate. When active one of the three Physical stats is decreased by 1 Level, plus 1 more level for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post. The target themselves decides which of the three stats is reduced, and no stat can be reduced below Level 1. Lasts for 2 posts, or until the wax seal is destroyed or removed, whichever comes first.														
992	3	6	Open Slot																
992	4	1	Mine		A flat, plate sized pressure sensitive wax bomb is created. The mine directs the explosion in a single direction. The mine is paper thin and blends in with any nonliving surface it is placed on. When created, the user specifies a certain trigger that sets it off. Examples of triggers are auditory cues, proximity to motion or heat, pressure/being touched, or being activated remotely. Triggers cannot be changed once set. The explosion is small and localized entirely on the object that triggered it. A mine can be destroyed by any attack that wouldn't otherwise trigger it. The blast exerts a concussive force up to level 7 in Strength, plus 1 more level of Strength for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post. Stage Five: Mines may be placed in the air, where they will appear translucent (but not invisible), like a spider's web. Stage Six: Mines may move with Level 3 Speed, and will automatically follow the closest target that satisfies its 'trigger'.														
992	4	2	Dermatologist		A waxy, but unnoticeable coating can be excreted over the user's skin, clothing, and armor. The first attack sustained after using this technique causes it to activate. The waxy coating quickly adapts and forms itself around the user to mimic the damage they would have normally taken, to give the appearance that they were struck. This includes mimicking artificial blood/bones and broken items. If the damage is overwhelming enough, the entire skin may be shed at once to leave a lifelike wax corpse behind. This technique consumes a kawarimi usage per post active and nullifies the damage of the original attack. This technique may be used on consenting targets, though it will still consume the user's kawarimi usages.														
992	4	3	Extension		Converting their very body, the user may extend any of their limbs or body parts as if they were made of pliant, soft wax. Extended limbs are just as strong and nimble and tough as normal, however keep in mind clothing and armor will not extend, and each limb can still only bend at the joints. This extension has a maximum of 3 meters, plus 2 more for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	4	4	Rake		A large claw of hot wax is formed over one or both arms, from the shoulder down and extending no more than a foot past the knuckles. This functions as limb armor in addition to a claw weapon. The wax claws can be placed on a surface to rapidly heat it up. The heat is strong enough to cause major blistering and skin splitting if maintained for a post. If the connection is lost then the heat will quickly dissipate. The claws may be given to another to wield, or removed and left on a surface, retaining their heat in both cases. Lasts for 2 posts, plus 1 more additional post for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	4	5	Taijutsu Seal		A single physical strike from the user, with their same Speed and Strength levels (including bonuses), may be contained inside of a wax seal. When the seal is activated, a wax limb forms (with an appropriate weapon if desired) to deliver the attack. This applies to special techniques and projectile taijutsu as well. Actions other than physical attacks may be sealed as well, as long as the user is normally capable of performing said action.														
992	4	6	Open Slot																
992	5	1	Rocket		A tube-shaped wax construct can be thrown into the air, which will then ignite with bright flames and take off into the sky. Rockets can change direction once per post and be given simple instructions much like bunshin. Rockets explode with a Strength Level of 8 in a radius of 4 meters. Rockets move at a flat Speed Level of 7. The longest a rocket can remain airborne is 3 posts. 1 rocket is created, plus 1 more for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	5	2	Modeler		If a sample of a person (hair, spit, blood, skin, etc) can be obtained, the user may construct a living 1 to 1 model of that person out of wax. The model will look, sound, feel, and act just like the person, exactly as they were when the original sample was collected. The model will possess identical stats and bonuses as the original, and can fight with the same taijutsu styles. The model has no chakra coils and cannot perform jutsu. The model can speak intelligently and shares the personality of the original, but will have no memory. False memories may be implanted in the model as needed, however the model can (and usually will) become hostile if it learns of its true nature. A model falls apart if it takes fatal damage and will 'bleed' red wax when struck. Cannot be repaired and will ultimately fall apart after 24 hours or by the end of the thread, though rumors of models with an indefinite duration still circulate.														
992	5	3	Gum Kata		A web-like latticework of wax is formed across the entire body, enhancing the user's physical prowess. The user gains an additional two Levels in all Physical stats for 1 post, plus 1 more post for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post. When the technique ends, they suffer a stat penalty equal to the bonus they received, to a minimum of 1 for two posts.														
992	5	4	Slave		Hot wax is created and covers the user completely, denying all senses and ability to communicate, including supernatural senses the user might possess from other jutsu/techniques. While in this state, the user may perform up to 3 wax jutsu per post, without needing any hand seals. No other techniques may be used that post other than wax jutsu. If they take any damage while under this technique, their concentration is ruined and the wax falls apart, and they cannot use any jutsu at all for that post. Provides a limited passive defense against Stage Four and below ninjutsu and level 6 and below Strength. Lasts 1 post, plus one more post for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	5	5	Self Seal		The user may place their entire body into a wax seal. This takes one post to accomplish, in which the user will melt into wax and pour themselves into an already prepared seal. While sealed they can still remain cognitive, but will not be able to sense anything unless placed on another person, animal, or loyal servant (like a bunshin or summon), in which case they will share sensory information with that target. This can be done discretely, without the target knowing, or be done openly, in which case the target and user may converse using thoughts alone. The user will 'pop' back out if the seal is broken, or after 5 posts. Targets the seal is active on may also use a single wax jutsu the sealed person knows, with consent.														
992	5	6	Open Slot																
992	6	1	Blastcord		A thread-like piece of wax is formed, then slipped into the ear of a target. This wax allows for the user to communicate to that person and hear and see what they do, but not the other way around. At any time the user may form a half hand seal to silently detonate the wax and cause a brain hemorrhage, nearly instantly killing the target. Because of the difficulty in getting the wax into the skull, this can only be done on targets who have been rendered immobile for an entire post. The wax can be removed by any medical shinobi, or if the target manages to somehow melt the wax with extreme heat while it's embedded inside them. Lasts the duration of the thread. Permission required to use on player characters.														
992	6	2	Breath of Cerberus	Inudora no Ibuki	From the neck of the user grows a compliment of 2 additional and identical heads. These are wax copies, but will still speak in stereo as the user does, and provide extra vision to the user. Any time any wax jutsu is used, each head will fire two independently aimed wax balls from their mouth at Physical Levels equal to twice the Stage of the technique used. Heads still operate even if severed and can only be destroyed by an attack that would normally destroy a head. Each head lasts for 3 posts.														
992	6	3	Flaming Wax Centipede	Hirou Omekade	An arm sized tube of wax is thrown from the body, which coils and twists across the ground with Level 5 Physical stats. Each time the creature is attacked and damaged, it regenerates and gains 1 Physical Level for each Wax jutsu the user used in the previous post. The creature always attacks whatever damaged it last (friend or foe), or if that target is destroyed, the next closest target. Its physical attributes can change after each doubling, usually into some kind of monster. Lasts 3 posts.														
992	6	4	Punishment		A large quantity of steaming wax is thrown from the body, like a javelin or discus. This steaming projectile is so hot it shreds and melts even metals, piercing mundane objects as if they were tissue paper. Upon collision with a target it fails to pierce, the wax rapidly boils and vaporizes, becoming an intense cloud of blinding white gaseous wax that extends outward in a 10 meter radius which persists for one post. This cloud blisters and cracks exposed skin, and if inhaled will burn the mouth and lungs to such an extent that breathing becomes intensely painful for the remainder of the thread. Gains an additional 5 meters of radius for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	6	5	Territory Seal		After taking an entire post placing at least 3 wax seals on surfaces in an area not exceeding a 20 meter radius, this technique activates. Each time a person enters or exits that area, an identical wax replica of the user will emerge from under the feet of the target and launch a single physical attack (full stats and bonuses) or use a single Stage Five or lower jutsu the user knows. The clone falls apart immediately after. The territory lasts for 3 posts, or until one of the three seals is destroyed.														
992	6	6	Open Slot																
992	7	1	Chaos Cricket		A small, single thread of incredibly dense wax is produced. This thread is inserted into the crack of a structure or environment. After one post the thread propagates throughout the entire structure, or if used in an outdoors area, through the earth and plant life within 50 meters of the insertion point. The entire affected area becomes a catalyst for wax jutsu and the user may launch or use any wax ability they know from any surface in the controlled area. In addition the user may cause all the wax to simultaneously explode, collapsing and vaporizing the structure and blasting everyone inside with level 14 Strength. The signature calling card of this technique is the noise the wax thread makes as it squeaks through solid objects, sometimes mistaken for that of a single cricket that one just can't locate. Gains 10 meters of radius for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	7	2	Reality Rift		For a set duration, any inanimate object in eyesight while this technique is active can be copied. This produces a wax replica at the user's fingertips with the same abilities, functionality, and effects as the original, and the user gains knowledge of all the special modifiers that exist on the object and how to operate or fight with it. If a weapon or projectile is copied while it is still in motion, the wax replica will form from any residual wax within eyesight and will mirror the motion and fire outwards to intercept and cancel it out. Unique registered items or objects being controlled by chakra (such as puppets) cannot be copied. The copies created under this effect fade in 1 post, while this technique will remain active for 1 post, plus 1 more post for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post.														
992	7	3	Perfect Preservation		A thin layer of white wax surrounds one palm, which steams with dangerous energy. Anyone struck by this palm will quickly become surrounded and encased with the same thin wax, denying vision and hearing and cutting off airflow. The wax is easy to remove but always reforms in the same post. The coating lasts for 1 post, plus 1 more post for each Wax jutsu used in the previous post. Anyone who dies while coated will have their body completely converted into a perfect wax statue, immortalizing their demise.														
992	7	4	Master Mode		After using this technique the user explodes into a shower of harmless wax, spreading out over a 30 meter radius. For the next 3 posts the user is free to move themselves around through any of their own wax as if teleporting, reforming their entire or parts of their body as desired. Even if damaged their body will simply melt into wax and disperse, letting them reform somewhere else uninjured. Passively all wax in the radius provides them with sight and auditory information as well. When this technique ends the user must piece their body back together, rendering them unable to use any jutsu or taijutsu for the rest of the thread.														
992	7	5	Life Link		Believed to be a 'soul' binding technique, which takes the life of another and places it into an ornate wax seal. This requires the consent of the target, or for the target to be unconscious. Sealing the life of a target causes the immediate body death of that individual. These seals may be placed onto a body which has died in the same thread to transfer the memories, personality, and abilities of the 'sealed' life, though anything else like bloodlines or body modifications will not be carried over. A good body or good medical assistance must be provided, however, because a corpse that is too damaged will simply die again once injected with new life. The user may use this on their own soul but their body is destroyed in the process, leaving only a wax seal in their place. This seal must be placed on a new dead body in order to transfer their soul. The soul inside the seal will completely perish if a new body is not found within 24 hours of the technique being used.

991	1	1	Basic Ribbon Control		The basic technique of Ribbon Wielding, Basic Ribbon Control allows the user to freely manipulate a number of ribbons attached to their person. This control is passive and does not consume jutsu usages. The user may manipulate the ribbons to grab onto and hold objects, and move around as well as using the ribbons to strike at opponents. --Base: Freely manipulate a single ribbon of up to 5 feet in length. --Stage 2: Freely manipulate up to 2 ribbons. --Stage 3: Freely manipulate up to 3 ribbons of up to 7 feet in length. --Stage 4: Freely manipulate up to 4 ribbons of up to 10 feet in length.														
991	1	2	Ribbon Blade		This technique turns part of a single ribbon (the last 2' of the ribbon) into a blade that can both cut and pierce. The user can apply this technique to as many ribbons as he can freely control at once, but each ribbon affected costs a stage 1 jutsu usage. Ribbons affected by this technique can no longer be used to grab and hold objects, and the technique persists for as long as the ribbon is actively controlled.														
991	1	3	Ribbon Claw		Focusing chakra into the ends of the ribbon, the user shapes it into a claw like shape and keeps the points surprisingly firm. In doing so they are able to use this as a very effective offensive tool to make swiping attacks at a target or to take hold of a ledge or branch for leverage. The dancer may use this technique on the fly, expending a usage but not an action. The claw is about as strong as a normal kunai.														
991	1	4	Dance of the Shapeshifter		This technique allows the user to camouflage their body (and later disguise themselves) using a multitude of ribbons which wrap around their body (under or over clothing as desired) and then change color to blend in with their surroundings. While this technique is maintained, the user cannot use any other ribbon techniques, nor can he freely manipulate ribbons. To keep the camouflage up, the user has to remain stationary. --Stage 2: The ribbons can now change the user's appearance to that of another person, though the imitation is purely visual. If struck by enemy ninjutsu, the user must expend another jutsu usage to keep the disguise up. In addition, the user may now move while using this technique. --Stage 3: The user is able to use ribbon techniques that involve ribbons wrapped around his body while this technique is active. Example: the user could activate Ribbon Armor in response to an attack without compromising his disguise.

991	1	6	Open Slot																
991	2	1	Ribbon Extension		This technique allows the user to double the length of his ribbons. This can be used to reach objects or locations otherwise out of reach, as well as provide an unexpected attack. Ribbon Extension can be used passively or actively; passively, it momentarily extends the length of up to half of the user's ribbons by 3 feet and does not cost a jutsu usage. Actively, it can be used in conjunction with any ninjutsu in the Ribbon Wielding list to double the range of that technique, costing a Stage 2 jutsu usage in addition to the normal cost for that technique. This use of Ribbon Extension persists for the duration of the attack it is paired with. --Stage 3: The user may now passively extend all of their ribbons up to 6 additional feet.. Active use of the technique now triples the range of another ribbon technique rather than doubling it and costs a Stage 3 jutsu usage.														
991	2	2	Tactile Ribbons		A dancer might claim that the ribbons are like a part of their body, but those who have mastered this technique know how true that really is. They have learned to extend their sense of touch through their ribbons, and are capable of learning more about a place or thing simply by touching it with their ribbons, using their ribbons in the same way that an animal uses their whiskers. This also allows the ribbons to do more complicated tasks without the dancer needing to view them, like pick a lock or keep a slippery prisoner bound.														
991	2	3	Ribbon Javelin		This technique allows the user to harden one of their ribbons into that of a throwing spear. The user then ties their remaining ribbons to the initial spear and launches it with a speed equal to that of their Power stat. This technique may only move in a straight line and has the effective range of all of the user's usable ribbons combined. This technique cannot be affected by Ribbon Extension. --Stage 3: The user may choose to remove a single ribbon from their person and cast it into the air. The ribbon then sharpens into a spear, and with another gesture, is directed to wherever the user points. --Stage 4: Same as above, though instead of a single ribbon, the user may cast two into the air. If both of these spears hit a defensive ninjutsu of Stage Three or less, they may pierce through it. In addition, these spears may now follow a target for three posts, but are incapable of making sudden turns and are therefore only capable of veering left and right.														
991	2	4	Ribbon Armor		This technique causes the user's ribbons to wrap around a desired area of his body and then harden into an armor that is effective against mundane projectiles as well as Stage 1 Ninjutsu and Level 1 Strength. In addition to protecting the user, this technique may be passively used to meld the ribbons in question into the user's clothing, hiding them from view. --Stage 3: The armor additionally protects against Stage 2 Ninjutsu and Level 2 Strength. --Stage 4: The armor additionally protects against Stage 3 Ninjutsu and level 3 Strength. --Stage 5: The armor additionally protects against Stage 4 Ninjutsu and level 4 Strength.

991	3	1	Dragon Ribbon Technique		The dancer kneels down, ribbons criss-crossing beneath and around them until they are encased. The ribbons surrounding the user act as cushioning while the rest of them extend outward, pushing them forward in long leaps across great distances. This technique can be used as a method of solo travel, but is most used as a method of escape. --Stage 4: With increased skill in ribbon control, the user can have three people accompany them while traveling. Alternatively, the user can sweep their ribbons around them in the blink of an eye, allowing them to exit the thread. They may not use any other techniques before or after using this affect.														
991	3	2	Subterranean Ribbon		Imbuing their ribbons with chakra, the user removes three of their ribbons and cast them into the ground together. When an enemy or unknown target is within five meters of the ribbons, they shoot out of the ground in hopes of confining the target. The ribbons work together and form a kind of bola in order to trip up the opponent and restrict movement. --Stage 4: The ribbons now take on a razor wire effect, capable of breaking the skin of whomever the technique hits, lest they're wearing armor.														
991	3	3	Living Ribbon		With a special enchantment, the dancer endows one of their ribbons with a semblance of life. This ribbon will coil around them as a snake might, perhaps poking out from the collar of their shirt to see their surroundings. This is because it is aware of its surroundings in a primitive way, including limited sight. It squeezes the dancer's body when it finds something suspicious, giving the dancer a figurative eye in the back of their head. It is passive, but must be deactivated before any real chakra is melded, and is incredibly obvious, limiting its uses in any situation where the shinobi might be trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. --Base: The Living Ribbon will only react to obvious threats near the dancer's person (a blade being drawn just behind) --Stage 4: The Living Ribbon will react to any obvious tails that might have otherwise been in the Dancer's blindspot and will not react to who the dancer believe to be their ally. --Stage 5: The Living Ribbon has intuition exceeding the average person, and can interpret a variety of cues, including the touching of hidden weapons or persons in an ideal ambush position.														
991	3	4	Parachute Technique		Two ribbons spring from the user's back after creating a makeshift harness beneath their clothes, quickly weaving themselves into a cross-hatch parachute. This can easily break a fall from any height and allows the dancer to glide over great distances at a slow but easy speed, assuming they began at a high place. After its first use the dancer may maintain this technique until they hit the ground, but two of their ribbons will be bound in the task until they cancel the jutsu. --Stage 4: Instead of a parachute, the ribbons create a glider, allowing the user to travel through the air at their full speed but still at a slow descent.

991	4	1	Puppet Ribbon Technique		If the basic Ribbon Control comes from being able to control ribbons like a limb, Puppet Ribbon revolves around controlling ribbons like a whole other body. A ribbon unspools to incredible length and contorts on itself, weaving into the shape of a person. This ribbon-person is a mimic of the user with no tai bonuses, working with dancer in ways that would otherwise be impossible. The clone cannot be destroyed with blunt force; to destroy it, one of two things must happen. The ribbons that make up its body must be completely destroyed, or the ribbon connecting them to the dancer must be broken-if you can reach it, it's as easy as slipping a knife over it. It may use Taijutsu techniques, or decompose itself in order order to use a single ribbon ninjutsu. --Stage 5: Ã‚Â½ Taijutsu Bonuses														
991	4	2	Ribbon Saw		All ribbons straighten out and begins whirling around the arm or leg of the user. The speed is such that the ribbons blur and create a circular-looking saw blade, with equivalent cutting power. These Saws function identical to any metal saw and can range in size from one foot in diameter to the maximum length of control the user has with their ribbons. Saws may also be launched outwards like a projectile at the cost of being unable to use ribbon techniques for one post.														
991	4	3	Drilling Ribbon		This technique is an attack coupled with a defense breaker. The tips of four ribbons are hardened with chakra and then the ribbon tips begin to rotate rapidly around a given point. You know how a drill works; this does that in a pretty damaging way, and it pierces through defensive techniques that would normally be able to stop something of this stage (so basically, it can penetrate Stage 4 defensive techniques).														
991	4	4	Dance of the Spider		Unraveling a number of ribbons, this technique launches the threads in a 360 degree spread where they then connect to anything and anyone they hit. Depending on the geography of the area, this can result in a large amount of sticky thread "webbing." Anyone caught in the webbing or attempting to move through it has their Speed reduced by 2 levels for the duration of the technique. The user can move freely in the area, unaffected by the adhesive threads which part to allow him passage. This technique lasts for 2 posts and while it is active the user cannot employ any other ribbon ninjutsu techniques. At the end of the technique, the threads quickly return to the user and reweave themselves into ribbons. --Stage 5: Those affected by the webbing have their Speed Level reduced by 3. The technique lasts 3 posts.

991	5	1	Grand Ribbon Control		Here the user's control over their ribbons has begun to reach its peak. They are capable of controlling five ribbons at once, reflecting the greater understanding that they now have over their own ribbons. These ribbons may be up to 15 feet in length. --Reserves 23: Six ribbons can be controlled at a time.														
991	5	2	Dance of the Falling Petals		Ribbons spread out from their body and fill the air, looping and knotting around and around and forming an uncountable number of small flower-shaped structures and saturating the air within the user's control range. Each flower is about an inch long and can be controlled independently, and possesses enough power to rip clean through a normal body. These flowers may be fired like precision guided projectiles, or spun around in a wild flurry. The technique lasts two posts, and no other ribbon control may be used for three posts after activation. The technique can only reach as far as the user's ribbons can from their body if attached.														
991	5	3	Ribbon Ward		A stronger version of the Ribbon Armor, this technique empowers ribbons wrapped around the user's body. This protects him from Stage 4 Ninjutsu and Level 5 Strength. The user may still meld the ribbons into that of their clothing. --Power 25: The user is protected from Stage 5 Ninjutsu. --Power 32: The user is protected from Stage 6 Ninjutsu. --Control 24: The user is protected from Level 7 Strength. --Control 31: The user is protected from Level 9 strength.														
991	5	4	Dance of Frenzied Vampire		Sometimes everything around you needs to die. This is a very indiscriminate technique, typically used when one finds themselves alone in the midst of enemies. Utilizing most (if not all) of the ribbons on the user, this technique transforms the area around the user into a whirling, swiping, stabbing blade barrier of sharpened ribbons dependent on their length. This technique lasts for 2 posts, during which time the user cannot use other ribbon ninjutsu techniques. --Intelligence 25: The technique duration is increased to 3 posts. --Intelligence 32: The technique duration is increased to 4 posts. --Willpower 24: The user can employ the Extension technique to double the range of his ribbons in conjunction with this technique. --Willpower 31: The user can employ the Extension technique to triple the range of his ribbons in conjunction with this technique.														
991	5	5	Ribbon Wings		Ribbons burst from the dancer's back, weaving together into two massive sets of wings that begin to beat and lift them up into the air. While concentrating on conserving chakra, a user can use this technique to traverse great distances. However, in the heat of combat, they are much more difficult to maintain, requiring one extra usage every post to maintain. The wings lose much of their effectiveness within ten feet of the ground and can telegraph the dancer's motions earlier than they would if the user was grounded, but some feel the advantage of distance of height is great enough to outweigh other concerns.														
991	5	6	Open Slot																
991	6	1	Ribbon Metamorphosis		Taking a step further than manipulating ribbons, the user makes use of this technique to transform their entire body into a mass of ribbons. In this form the user trades their ordinary strengths and weaknesses as a human being out for an array of different ones. As a ribbon being they are able to freely control their height, size and motion, allowing them to move in ways that a human being would ordinarily find impossible, including squeezing under doors and bending in ordinarily spine breaking directions. Strikes that would have otherwise killed instantly are rendered mundane by the user's lack of organs and blunt strikes are severely reduced in effectiveness. Fire and slashing attacks, on the other hand, are far more dangerous. This form lasts for two posts but can be extended with another jutsu usage. Ribbon jutsu may still be used but no others can.														
991	6	2	Swaddle		Often times, a ribbon wielder needs to find a way to end a fight quickly. This technique serves as one of those ways. By using all six of their ribbons, the user hardens them with chakra and thrusts them forward, swaddling the target tightly. The ribbons then begin to tighten quickly. At the end of the first post, the character wrapped inside will begin to lose their breath. By the second post, the character wrapped inside will begin to experience pain from their body being crushed. By the third post, bones will begin to break and organs shall start to fail. In order to break free, the character trapped needs a base Strength higher than the user's base Power stat. Alternative, techniques stage 5 and above may save them, should they be able to make hand seals. Due to the chakra flowing through the ribbons, any outside attacks on the ribbons themselves will need to be at least stage 5 to work.														
991	6	3	Flechette		By flattening and curving the tips of the ribbons the user may turn a single ribbon into an extreme aerodynamic, armor piercing weapon. The edge, unlike the ones formed by the blade technique, is brittle and thus cannot be used for defense. However it may be fired forward where its trajectory will be a straight line a mile long. No obstacle save for supernaturally hard materials will stop it, and the Flechette will travel fast and far enough to leave smoldering inch wide holes in its wake. The wounds caused by the Flechette are likewise only an inch wide, but will completely pierce any and all targets it passes through, save for an equal stage defense, proving lethal if vital areas are hit.														
991	6	4	Dance of the Wight		After a ribbon has been wrapped around an living object, the user may drain that object of strength and vitality and channel it into themselves. For every ribbon that is touching the target, one level in all physical stats is drained per post, and user benefits from a one level increase for every two posts that the target is drained. This effect lasts as long as the ribbon is touching the target. If the ribbon is broken during the process (before the user can properly sever the connection), the user suffers a stat penalty equal to the amount drained. The target's stats cannot drop below 1, however the users can and will result in death should it occur.

991	7	1	Unwoven		By sending a single ribbon out to intercept a ninjutsu attack, the user can capture the chakra contained within it and nullify the technique completely. The ribbon comes unfurled into a multitude of threads, which then launch themselves towards the chakra signature that the jutsu originated from. If struck by these threads the target will be unable to use that same technique again for the remainder of the thread. The reflected technique fizzles into nothingness if it continues on its path for more than seventy feet. Cannot be used on stage seven or higher techniques.														
991	7	2	Knot		The user seals themselves within a massive knotted ball of their own ribbons. This ball is impenetrable to all normal attack and is likewise invulnerable to jutsu lower in stage than itself. The user may move around and attack with their ribbons while in the Knot, even being capable of using other ribbon based ninjutsu while doing so. Sight is impossible outside the Knot but the user may make eyeholes if they desire (at the cost of giving attackers an opening). The Knot lasts for three posts, after of which all ribbons fall inert for the remainder of the thread.														
991	7	3	Dance of the Explosive Phantom Touch		The user first takes each of their ribbons and casts them into the air. Each ribbon then divides in half, and then those in half, creating a total of twenty-four useable ribbons before they fade, becoming nearly invisible. These newly created ribbons then float ominously around the user, up to a maximum of two posts. By performing the last seal, the user may then will each of twenty-four ribbons, individually or together, towards a target. The ribbon is capable of penetrating through two meters of reinforced steel, but perhaps more importantly is its secondary ability. Should the user perform a second seal, they may will their ribbons to explode with the force of two explosive tags.														
991	7	4	Dance of the Revenant		The final dance that ribbon wielders learn (and usually the final dance their foes will ever see), the Dance of the Revenant gives each ribbon the user possesses a soul of its own. After using this technique the user may make a copy (much like a bunshin) of any person that a ribbon is currently attached to, alive or dead. These Revenants have the full stats of those they draw from and are said to be 'of the same cloth', frequently having the same thought patterns and behaviors of those whose soul they have seemed to copy. A Revenant may use one technique that the original knew before unraveling. Any physical attack stronger or equal to than Stage 7 will dispel this bunshin immediately, and any ninjutsu attack stronger than or equal Stage 5 will as well.

989	1	1	Wings: Dark Wind		The user summons a small, fast bird, typically a swallow and directs them towards a target. The swallow charges through the air at the target, its wingtips capable of slashing as though they were actually kunai. Whether it strikes or misses, the bird retreats in a puff of smoke after traveling thirty feet. Stage Two: The bird is able to rebound off a target, allowing it to strike another within ten feet. Stage Three: Rebounds a second time. The bird can charge a single target multiple times. Stage Four: Rebounds a third time. The bird can charge a single target multiple times.														
989	1	2	Crests: Safety in Numbers		Summons a school of small fish, all dressed in identical costumes. The fish swim through the air around the user, apparently uninhibited by any lack of water. They effectively form a smoke screen, obscuring the user from view and block all mundane projectiles (kunai, shuriken, etc that are not the subject of a jutsu). Ninjutsu, however, scare the fish and cause them to scatter, disappearing back to their home realm. Stage Two: The fish are now resistant to stage one ninjutsu. Stage Three: Resistant to stage two ninjutsu. The school expands enough to hide two people behind. Stage Four: Resistant to stage three ninjutsu. Can shelter three people.														
989	1	3	Swarms: Cicada Call		A cicada descends and lands on the user, typically perching on their shoulder. The user can indicate up to two other people to bear cicadas; these targets are soon joined by their own insect companions. As long as the cicada remains in contact with a human, it can steal their speech, causing the user's words to lose all sound, and translate it as a loud buzzing capable of resonating in a half-mile radius. The buzzing is incomprehensible to most ears, but anyone else with a cicada born from this jutsu has the buzzing transmitted to them as normal human speech. This enables covert long distant communication without the use of standard communication units. The cicadas remain for five posts. Stage Two: Up to four other people can receive cicadas.														
989	1	4	Earth: Close Combat		Summons a battle-scarred stag burdened with all manner of weapons. The stag steps forward and attempts to gore a target within ten feet with its massive antlers. The horns are heavy and durable, though not particularly sharp; while capable of breaking skin they do not leave clean wounds. Stage Two: The stag's antlers are now as sharp as shinobi blades. Stage Three: As above, plus the stag will charge an enemy within twenty feet.														
989	1	5	Legends: Tanuki's Trick		Descriptions: A tanuki wanderer, clad in wide hat and carrying wine, appears to answer the summoner's call. With a touch of his paws, the tanuki is capable of transforming objects. Any weapon the user indicates can be turned into any universal weapon of equal or lesser item point value. Non-weapon objects can be changed into other objects of similar mass and volume; a pencil can become a fork, but not a book. The objects automatically revert back after three posts or when the user recites a 'magic phrase', a nonsense code arranged with the House when this contract is first signed. The user may only transform their own possessions or unattended objects and the tanuki will never approach an enemy to change their items.														
989	1	6	Open Slot																
989	2	1	Wings: Mockingbird's Guise		Summons a House courtesan, an expert at navigating social situations. Typically a mockingbird, the summon opens a painted fan and waves it over the summoner. Chakra weaves over the user's body and alters their appearance into any other person, or into an entirely fictional composite. This functions similarly to henge, capable of even emulating voices. The mockingbird's deceit is enhanced, however, and the chakra shell will not break until the user attempts to attack or use any jutsu; striking the illusion will not dispel it. After creating the disguise, the bird vanishes.														
989	2	2	Crests: Playful Tricksters		A dolphin bursts forth from the ground or water, cackling and dancing around the user for a moment. It then dives back below, able to swim through any material. The dolphin leaps out from under a target enemy, quickly darting in and out of site. It doesn't actually harm the target, but instead harasses them and disrupts concentration and movement. The dolphin also attempts to pilfer items, often stealing shuriken and kunai from pockets and trying to knock larger weapons out of hand. This harassment lasts for a post before the dolphin dives below and leaves. Stage Three: Two dolphins are summoned, capable of harassing the same or separate targets. Stage Four: As above, but three dolphins are summoned.														
989	2	3	Swarms: Stinging Cloud		Bees pour forth from the summoner's sleeves and begin to swarm in a buzzing cloud. The bees are larger than normal, each almost the length of a human hand, and they travel as a unit towards an enemy. They swarm over the target, stinging repeatedly. The dozen bees are each capable of stinging multiple times without risk, and their minor venom leaves wounds inflamed and burning. The swarm flies away after a post. Stage Three: The number of bees increase to two dozen. Stage Four: As above, plus the bees' toxin weakens the clotting response and causes infected wounds to bleed.														
989	2	4	Earth: Far-Reaching Power		A lion strolls from the summoning circle and lays at the summoner's feet. The great cat stretches out a paw, claws extended, and swipes down through the air. A spectral image of its paw appears anywhere within twenty feet and mimics the motion, scratching enemies with its sharp claws. Stage Three: Two images are formed. Stage Four: Three images are formed and may strike up to thirty feet away.														
989	2	5	Legends: Yosuzume's Curse		Summons a large black mountain bird that seems to drip the very essence of shadow off its wingtips. Darkness follows it like a shroud; as it flies, yosuzume creates a field of black thicker than any shinobi smoke bomb. A ten foot radius sphere can be covered in the deepest darkness, which can only be penetrated by bloodlines like the Byakugan. The veil lasts for two posts before it dissipates. Stage Three: The sphere expands to fifteen foot radius. Stage Four: The sphere expands to a twenty five foot radius and can no longer be seen through by doujutsu.														
989	2	6	Open Slot																
989	3	1	Wings: Aerial Bombardment		The user summons an adept glider, typically a flying squirrel. Often clad in goggles and carrying a bundled cloth, the squirrel immediately catches a warm air current with its flaps and disappears up into the sky. On the following post, a hail of kunai rain over a ten foot radius anywhere in sight. Stage Four: The squirrel also drops fuuma shuriken and other large thrown weapons. Stage Five: Some of the kunai are tied to burning explosive tags, which detonate near the ground.														
989	3	2	Crests: Blue Lightning		A barracuda or other swift, predatory fish appears, floating in mid-air and smiling with jagged teeth. The hunter rushes down a target, but its trajectory bends and turns sharply, creating a path like a lightning bolt. The barracuda is thus difficult to track, providing it a better chance of striking a blow from an unexpected angle. Stage Four: Two barracuda attack. Stage Five: Three barracuda attack.														
989	3	3	Swarms: Natural Armor		Numerous large stag and hercules beetles appear and land on the user, forming a suit of living armor reminiscent of samurai garb, complete with ornamental horns. The beetles hard shells are resilient to ninjutsu, allowing them to absorb enemy chakra. Nearby ninjutsu can actually be bent into the beetles, protection the user's face, hands, and other uncovered areas. However, the beetles are fragile and fly away rather than suffer taijutsu strikes. The beetles can absorb stage three ninjutsu and below, but provide no defense to taijutsu, and only protect the user for one post. Stage Four: The beetles absorb stage four ninjutsu and below. Stage Five: The beetles absorb stage five ninjutsu and below.														
989	3	4	Earth: Tactical Movement		Descriptions: Summons a horse clad in barding who allows the user to climb up into the saddle. The horse is capable of moving much faster than normal horses, enabling the user to quickly cover long distances. Thus, the user can be dispatched against far away threats or return home to defend from out in the field. The horse can carry up to two passengers and remains until it reaches its destination or is attacked. The horse cannot be used to increase combat speed and will not assist a summoner in charging an enemy. Stage Four: The horse can appear already in motion, flinging the summoner onto its back and riding off. This allows a thread to be exited immediately, but is the only jutsu a summoner can use that post.														
989	3	5	Legends: Akabeko's Divinity		With a low moo, akabeko, the red cow, appears at the summoner's elbow affectionately. Akabeko can be directed to help anyone nearby. With a touch of the cow's nose, a target is immediately healed of any mundane disease and purged of all toxins, including the effects of poisons, drugs, and alcohol. In addition, Akabeko's touch leaves a lingering protection; those affected are immune to contracting further disease or succumbing to toxins for the next three posts. In combat, Akabeko will only follow the user for one post, but outside combat will stay with the user for three posts or to heal three people. Stage Four: Non-mundane toxins, such as the chakra poisoning list and poisons created via ninjutsu, below stage three may be dispelled. Such effects are not effected by Akabeko's prevention. Stage Five: As above, but effects below stage four may be dispelled.

989	4	1	Wings: Honor Guard		An emergency defensive jutsu, this technique requires handseals but does not spread the usual visual kuchiyose lines anywhere. Instead, a water fowl emerges in a spray of mist, carrying an unsheathed katana. The duck blocks any single taijutsu strike with the dull side of the blade, then vanishes. Note: May only be used once per thread.														
989	4	2	Crests: Tail Whip		A large alligator or crocodile, often smoking a pipe, appears at the summoner's feet. With a hiss, the massive reptile steps forward and turns, swinging its tail in a wide arc that reaches twenty feet in a cone. The tail smashes through wood and other brittle defenses and is capable of denting metal and crushing stone. After a half rotation, the beast pauses, exhales a smoke ring, and disappears.														
989	4	3	Swarms: Teeming Industry		Summons a trio of giant ants the size of retrievers, all clad in traditional coats and headbands of construction workers. The ants build any structure imaginable for the user, including small cabins, bridges, watch towers, and other such carpentry projects. They summon their own materials and thousands of normal ants to assist them. The structures they create are permanent, but are considered mundane and do not defend against shinobi attacks. The ants will work for up to three posts and are capable of finishing a structure and furnishings taking up a ten foot cube within a single post. They refuse to build weapons of any sort and anything they make must be made of wood, adobe, or stone. They will not enter combat and dispel if attacked. Stage Five: The ants can fill a fifteen foot cube per post.														
989	4	4	Earth: Reckless Assault		A ram the size of a pony appears in mid-air, legs already moving. When it touches the ground, the beast takes off like an arrow let free. As the ram runs, it lowers its head and its curled horns begin to glow blue. The ram travels in a straight line and smashes through any obstacles and does not stop until it hits flesh. It strikes targets with enough force to break bones and leave even jounin winded. Stage Five: Upon striking a target, the ram kicks its head back and launches the victim ten feet into the air straight up.														
989	4	5	Legends: Komainu's Fealty		A pair of guardian lion-dogs, the komainu, appear at the user's feet. The howl and take up positions in front of the summoner, guarding him as though he were a shrine gate. The area around the user warps and actually becomes the grounds of a shrine. The ground is covered with gray brick, the trees are pushed aside by pillars, lanterns, and a large red gate over the summoner's head. If used over open water, the shrine floats on the surface, unaffected by wave motion. The shrine covers a twenty foot radius and holds for two posts. Anyone who stands on the shrine grounds is unable to mold chakra enough to use jutsu, creating a level playing field for diplomatic use Stage Five: The shrine covers a thirty foot radius and holds for three posts. Note: Kawarimi and shunshin effects may be used while within the shrine grounds.														
989	4	6	Open Slot																
989	5	1	Wings: Graceful Stride		Summons a crane or heron noble, complete with metal headdress fastened to their feathers. The bird stands on one leg and uses the other foot to point with a single claw. A rush of air launches forward, creating a wind tunnel. This column of air pushes aside mundane water, mud, flame, branches, and any other material that might threaten the user. The tunnel allows the user to travel safely and swiftly through any environment; it also renders their movements silent to those outside the tunnel. A hundred feet of contiguous tunnel can be created, bent as the user directs, and the effect lasts for three posts. Enemy ninjutsu cause the tunnel to collapse.														
989	5	2	Crests: Ocean's Blessing		A sea turtle swims out of the kuchiose lines, growing in size as it emerges. With a call like a whale song, the turtle takes up position in the air, hanging there and turning its shell towards the enemy. Ninjutsu up to stage four are deflected off its shell; flame harmlessly dissipates its heat, earth crumbles to pebbles, and so on. In addition, the turtle is immune to Strength levels six and below. Intelligence 24: Deflects stage five ninjutsu. Intelligence 31: Deflects stage six ninjutsu. Tactics 23: Immune to Strength level seven. Tactics 30: Immune to Strength level eight.														
989	5	3	Swarms: Blade Dance		A mantis swordmaster, as tall as a human, appears next to the summoner, hiding its face behind its folded arms. Its movements are almost invisible, for in the next instant, its claws have opened and launched chakra blades through the air. The blades are each as long as a katana and fall into each other as they move, forming a glowing blue cross that threatens to slice enemies apart. The blades travel up to thirty feet before shrinking and fading away.														
989	5	4	Earth: Guerrilla Tactics		A covert summon, no animal appears to answer the summoner's call. Instead, dark markings begin to stretch up the user's arm from the summoning circle. These marks distort light around the user and provide them with camouflage, like a tiger. The summoner does not become invisible, but adopts a translucent, ghost-like image that allows on-lookers to see objects through him. As long as the user moves slowly and stays partially obscured, they are as difficult to detect as the greatest hunting animals. This cloaking effect lasts up to two posts.														
989	5	5	Legends: Ryu's Charge		A dragon flows out of the summoning circles, twisting its long body through the air as it rises like a column of smoke. The dragon laughs as it turns and then corkscrews down at a target. Its weight and speed together are enough to break bones when it crashes into a human, but its claws and teeth are also capable of tearing through flesh like paper.														
989	5	6	Open Slot																
989	6	1	Wings: Divine Wind		The user performs a typical summon, placing his hand against the air and letting the summon lines spiral out. For a moment, the effect isn't apparent, but this silence is followed by a piercing a screech. A great eagle, as large as a human, comes screaming through the air from above and behind the summoner. The eagle crashes through obstacles, capable of knocking down brick walls, and attempts to divebomb a visible target and skewer them with the two great lances clutched in its talons. Upon landing, the eagle buffets up a shroud of dust and disappears.														
989	6	2	Crests: Web of the Deep		Calling upon the great octopus and squid families, the user thrusts their palm into the air. The summon circle appears over their hand followed by a burst of massive, wriggling tentacles. Eight rubbery limbs flood out of the gate, each one covered in hooked suction cups. The tentacles are capable of reaching thirty feet and actively seek out enemies to entangle. Once caught, a target is pulled and torn by the suction cups, which leave dollar sized wounds wherever they touch. Stage six ninjutsu and strength level seven or higher cause the tentacles to retreat back into the gate. The hold can be maintained for up to three posts by the user, but they most keep their arm outstretched and cannot use any other jutsu for the duration.														
989	6	3	Swarms: Hidden Centipede Hands		The user's clothes bulge briefly as a million little legs brush over their skin. Then, a horde of massive centipedes, like anchor chains, fly out of the summoner's sleeves. The centipedes many legs are sharp and capable of puncturing even iron armor, and their mandibles drip with poison. Anyone unfortunate enough to be caught by the stream of clattering bugs quickly falls ill as though affected by hallucinogenic poison. The centipedes can be launched up to forty feet away and crawl over targets for a post before disappearing.														
989	6	4	Earth: Blood Alliance		A shinobi dog appears, holding the strap of a tower shield in its jaws. With a smooth motion, the dog throws the shield into the air and lets out a howl. The shield stands up straight and then flies forward through the air, a great metal wall that shrugs off ninjutsu stage five and below. The shield can fly forty feet and hits with enough force to crush the bones of anyone unlucky enough to have their back to a wall when it arrives. With another bark, both dog and shield disappear once the latter has traveled its full trajectory.														
989	6	5	Legends: Ho-o's Spirit		Descriptions: Summons the pair of firebirds, Feng and Huang. The couple traipse slowly around the summoner, then glide towards a target. Though unable to bestow the full might of their healing capabilities, the birds can still perform small wonders. They fly in a circle over the wounded and glittering dust falls from their wings with each beat. The dust heals even fatal wounds, saving a patient from the very brink of death. Severed limbs can be restored without pain. Those healed by the birds have their chakra coils closed for the following post; they cannot use jutsu immediately following the healing treatment. This effect cannot be used offensively, as an unwilling recipient of the birds' power can deny, rendering them immune to the healing. Note: Ho-o's Spirit may only successfully heal once per thread.

989	7	1	Wings: The Morning King, Who Raises the Heavens		A rooster, larger than a man and clad in glittering jewels, appears in a puff of smoke and turns one of his yellow eyes to the sky. The rooster brays, a sound loud enough to cause pain, and calls forth a miracle. No matter the time or weather, the sun parts the clouds and rests in the high noon position. The sun seems close enough to touch, tendrils of flame leaping over its surface. A hundred foot radius around the user is bathed in its intense light and heat during the first post. On the second post, all flammable material within range, including clothing, smoulders and bursts into flame and anyone, except the user, whose eyes remain open are rendered blind as they, too, catch fire and burn out. At the start of the third post, the sun recedes to its normal place and intensity and the rooster fades away.														
989	7	2	Crests: The Ancient King, Who Hunts Us All		Upon completing the summon, the earth beneath the user bulges, pushed by something giant hidden below. A fin, six feet tall, bursts through the soil, providing a momentary clue to the shark emperor's presence before slowly sinking underground. A dozen normal-sized sharks start to frenzy, leaping in and out of the earth and attempting to maim all targets within fifty feet of the user during this first post. On the second post, the frenzied sharks recede just as the king of sharks himself emerges from below a singular target, massive mouth open and waiting. The shark king attempts to swallow the target, but is not above taking a few limbs on a near miss. He sinks back into the earth and returns to his home; anyone or anything in his stomach is forever lost.														
989	7	3	Swarms: The Holy Queen, Who Birthed Legion		Summons the Queen, a projection of the spirits of the many queens who rule the House of Swarms. With a beat of her wings and the wave of her hand, the Queen casts her own summon, bringing in thousands of her subjects, insects of all species and sizes. They fly together as a thick cloud and absorb any stage six or lower ninjutsu, nullifying it. On the second post, the cloud parts far enough for the Queen to point a finger, immediately using the absorbed ninjutsu, reflected back at the original user. After taking her parting shot, the Queen curtsies and disperses as another great swarm.														
989	7	4	Earth: The Mad King, Who Brings Ruin		The king of bulls appears, standing over the summoner at almost twenty feet tall at the shoulder. The bull's hide is black and coils of steam rise off him; each breath releases a tuft of smog from his nose. For the first post, the bull merely waits, digging a hoof into the soil and allowing the summoner enough time to escape. At the start of the second post, the bull lets out a thundering roar and charges, trampling everything underfoot. He goes into a rage, thrashing and kicking, leveling everything within a fifty foot radius of his initial summon location. At the start of the third post, he vanishes, leaving only a ring of smog and a circle of destruction.														
989	7	5	Legends: The Mythic King, Who Breathes Life		With a sudden hush, silence falls over the area around the summoner as each leaf seems to freeze in place. From the summoner's own shadow emerges a kirin, whose great antlers teem with vines and flowers. The kirin stands perfectly still for two posts, its thin hooves supported by the grass below without flattening it. At any time during these two posts, the summoner can implore the kirin for its assistance once. The kirin is capable of utterly negating any other attack: ninjutsu dissipate, genjutsu dispel, taijutsu lose all force, summons are banished, and so on. This cancellation can occur retroactively, allowing the kirin to remove injuries or effects created by jutsu that have already resolved, including reviving those killed by jutsu used within the two post window. If his assistance is not called for by the start of the third post, the kirin turns to wind and rushes away. Note: The kirin's cancellation ability may only be used once per thread. The kirin will not cancel an enemy's kawarimi-effect.

988	1	1	Shadow Projectile	Kage no Yadama	Projectiles thrown using this technique cannot be seen when they are in shadow. This most often takes the form of throwing two projectiles with one hidden in the shadow of the other, but also makes projectiles that travel in shaded or dark areas (such as at night) invisible to normal vision as well. Large projectiles thrown with this technique automatically grant this benefit to any smaller projectiles in their own shadow. Two projectiles may be thrown using this jutsu for each Stage known in this list.														
988	1	2	Projectile Beacon	Rouka no Yadama	A thrown projectile will track and home in on a spot the user points to and maintains eye contact with, or to any projectile the user has thrown in the thread. This doesn't propel the projectile any faster or remove the force of gravity, rather it simply nudges and shifts the trajectory and orientation of a projectile mid-flight to reach the target. This also doesn't extend the range of the projectile. Projectiles under the influence of this jutsu can curve and arc as desired, however. Large projectiles only require the user to maintain eye contact and do not require pointing. Stage Two: By pointing with a second hand, the projectile may gain a burst of speed once mid-flight, as if the user had thrown it a second time. Stage Three:: If the user holds a hand seal after throwing, they can control the projectile directly while in flight instead.														
988	1	3	Meteor Projectile	Ryuuseiu no Yadama	Casting a single projectile high in the air, the user can freeze it in place with a hand seal. At any later time they may point to a location and send the projectile flying towards it with their normal throwing speed. The projectile can also be set as a trap, such that somebody who walks within a 10 foot radius of it will become its target automatically instead. A Large projectile will trigger at a target within 50 feet of the projectile. One more projectile may be thrown and frozen in place for each Stage known in this list. The projectiles will remain frozen for the duration of the thread.														
988	1	4	Projectile Scroll	Tobidougu Ippuku	Stored projectiles in sealing tags, most often in the form of a long scroll but occasionally in tattoos or books, can be summoned and thrown en masse with no delay, sometimes with a literal snap of the fingers. While historically this technique is used for large scale assaults, it can be used to summon a single projectile as well, as the true function of the jutsu isn't just the throwing of projectiles. For the post this technique is used, all physically thrown objects by the user may possess the Return or Recall item modifiers. Large projectiles have both. Stage Two: At the end of the technique, if desired, all thrown projectiles using this technique may be resummoned inside their original seals.														
988	1	5	Second Wind	Jiikaze	Chakra-enhanced threads are attached to a thrown projectile. Typically, these threads are used to lay tripwires or tie up targets. Strings are clearly visible and destroyed by Level 1 Strength. String attached to a Large projectile requires twice as much Strength to break. Stage Two Effect: Strings can cut like razor wire, and require Level 2 Strength to destroy. Stage Three Effect: Strings are now harder to see, and require Level 3 Strength to destroy.														
988	1	6	Drilling	Kurinuku	A projectile is twisted when it is thrown, which keeps the spin in flight via chakra. This slows the projectile so much that it isn't uncommon for genin to be able to run alongside their own projectile. The spin does, however, counteract the force of gravity, such that as long as the user maintains eye contact with the projectile it will continue traveling along a straight path through the air, including if it ricochets. Large projectiles do not require continuous eye contact to maintain this jutsu after being thrown, but cannot ricochet and loses its power after any collision. One additional projectile may be thrown this way for each Stage known in this list.														
988	2	1	Burrowing Projectile	Horisageru no Yadama	Projectiles the user throws may sink into any earthen surface, and re-emerge at any point in their eyesight. Once the projectiles emerge they are launched from the surface with the same force as a normal throw. The projectiles physically travel to the location however, and only travel at the user's Speed Level. Large projectiles can sink back into the earth after their initial impact, and repeat this process 1 additional time.														
988	2	2	Projectile Spirit	Yurei no Yadama	Projectiles thrown with this technique can pass through stationary inanimate material as if it were air. The inanimate object must be lower in elevation than where it was thrown from, however. Normal projectiles cannot penetrate defensive ninjutsu, but Large projectiles may pass through defensive ninjutsu 2 Stages lower than the highest Stage the user knows in this list.														
988	2	3	Projectile Call	Yobikake no Yadama	Channeling chakra to their fingertips, the user sends out a pulse in a 30 foot radius. All projectiles not within arms reach of another person within this radius are then launched towards them. The projectiles travel in a completely linear path, at the same Speed and Strength Levels of the user. If the projectiles do not strike another target and hit the user, rather than causing damage, a temporary sealing tattoo is formed on the body of the user where they strike, which then can be unsealed at any point in the thread to regain access to that projectile. If the user desires, the projectiles can be sealed into the appropriate medium (scrolls, tags, books, etc) rather than as tattoos.														
988	2	4	Twin Dragon	Futago Ryuu	Two scrolls burst outward, forming a spiraling helix with the user in the middle. The scrolls extend up 10 feet in any direction, and the user may freely move up and down through the column as if levitating while performing this technique. Projectiles can be thrown normally or summoned from the scrolls, and as long as the user remains within the two scrolls all their projectiles gain 2 Levels of either Speed or Strength. Large projectiles gain both. The spiral extends out to the user's reach and lasts for 2 posts, and the scrolls can be destroyed by any mundane means to end the technique early. Stage Three: The scrolls can extend an additional 10 feet for every Stage known in this list. Stage Four: The spiral can last 1 more post OR provide double the Physical bonus.														
988	2	5	Spider Bomb	Kumo Bakudan	A single projectile is thrown with a special seal carved into it. When the projectile hits a target a slimy spray of string erupts from its surface in a 10 foot radius, slowing those caught in it by 1 Speed Level for 2 posts, to a minimum of 1. The user is always vaguely aware of how fast a target is when they get caught in this technique. This projectile can also be buried or otherwise hidden, and only activated at will by the user, or by some other triggering means like a tripwire or if stepped on. The string lasts for 2 posts after forming. A Large projectile may explode several times after being thrown, up to the highest Stage known in this list, flinging the slime anywhere along its trajectory. Stage Three: Effect radius increases to 30 feet. Stage Four: String (but not the stat penalty) lasts for the duration of the thread.														
988	2	6	Infection	Kansen	Projectiles can be thrown that seal themselves onto a surface on impact, rather than causing damage. On living targets this takes the form of a tattoo, while on inanimate objects it appears more like an engraving. At the user's will they can either harmlessly cause the tag to pop the item back out, or immediately reactivate the projectile which inflicts its damage onto the target. A Large projectile seal causes damage twice, as if the projectile had passed straight through the original target. The only way to remove the seal once it is in place is with a relevant sealing jutsu, using a medical extraction technique, or by physically carving out at least half an inch of flesh below the seal.														
988	3	1	Projectile Rain	Ame no Yadama	A projectile is thrown with numerous other sealed projectiles on its surface. At the user's will, the sealed projectiles are released, which expand and cover a 10 foot radius (30 feet for Large projectiles), all traveling with the same speed and power of the original. One additional similar projectile can be thrown for every Stage known in this list.														
988	3	2	Hovering	Teimei	When used, projectiles the user controls may be frozen in midair. While locked in place, a blue seals forms on the projectile, designating it as frozen. When frozen like this any normal attack will knock them loose and cause them to lose all velocity. However, the user themselves can treat the projectiles as stationary, and in fact can walk/jump/climb using them as they wish so long as they remain frozen. At the user's will, the projectiles may be unfrozen, at which point they resume their normal flight trajectory. Stage Four: Frozen projectiles gain +1 Level of Speed and Strength every post they are frozen.														
988	3	3	Distraction	Gyakujou	A projectile is charged with either sound or light. At the user's will or upon impact, the projectile will play the sound or shine brightly, like either part of a flashbang. Large projectiles may do both. Less energy can be placed into the projectile allowing it to play sounds like human speech, or glow softly as if it has the Glow modifier. No more than 1 post of sound or light can be stored in the projectile, although it may be stored indefinitely once created. One projectile can be charged this way per usage for every Stage known in this list.														
988	3	4	Cherry Bomb	Outou no Bakudan	Requirement: Intelligence 9, Willpower 9, Control 7 A projectile is thrown which upon impact erupts into a cloud of flower-petal like confetti. This can also be done from any mundane seal, such as from a scroll. Each petal of this confetti then explodes upon touch like a firecracker, and can ignite flammable surfaces with a mundane fire. If a Large projectile is used, anyone caught by any of the petals will emit very visible black smoke for 2 posts afterwards. Stage Four: Each petal explodes like an explosive pouch. Stage Five: Each petal explodes like an explosive tag.														
988	3	5	Soul Needle	Reikon Senbon	Blood, either the user's own or freshly acquired from other sources, can be solidified into a projectile. This technique is passive, allowing the user to create any 0 cost projectile from an equivalent mass of blood. Projectiles formed this way fall apart in the post after they are made. Stage Four: 1 cost projectiles may be formed. Stage Five: Blood projectiles have the Tracer item modifier.														
988	3	6	The Needle's Burden	Senbon no Fuka	A projectile is thrown that upon impact erupts into a thick dust in a 1 foot radius (5 feet for Large projectiles). Living targets which touch the dust feel the affected regions become stiff and heavy, as if they were turning to stone, which makes precision movements (like hand seals) difficult to impossible. The dust disappears after 1 post. Stage Four: Double radius dust cloud, lingers for 1 more post. Stage Five: One projectile in sight that was originally thrown by the user may erupt into a cloud instead														
988	4	1	Coming of Age	Seijin Shiki	Considered a ritual rite of passage for projectile users, the Seijin Shiki technique is passive and can only be used once per thread. After a short moment of concentration, the user may perform a single projectile ninjutsu from each Stage they know. Large projectiles thrown while under this technique can use maximum scaling regardless of the user's highest Stage in this list. While performing this technique so much chakra is burned from the user that they often have steam rising off their bodies as a result.														
988	4	2	Five Pointed Fingers	Go Kadogateru no Tesaki	5 normal projectiles or 1 Large projectile may be thrown, with their exact flight path controlled precisely by one finger each on one of the user's hands. The projectiles will cease being controlled by the user once they hit an object, or until the user releases them by using the hand for something else. These projectiles are propelled by chakra, and thus can remain in flight/remain hovering indefinitely, but otherwise only strike with the same Speed and Strength Levels of a normal throw. If a Large projectile is used, the user may close their eyes to view visual information (but not auditory) through the projectile so long as it is under control of this jutsu.														
988	4	3	Hidden	Namaru	After using this technique the user's skin seems to become hazy and indistinct. For the duration of the technique, the user is effectively invisible while their projectiles are still in flight. They can still be detected by augmented vision but to mundane sight they are completely transparent. This lasts for 3 posts, but ends immediately if any projectile thrown draws blood. Stage Five: One additional nearby person may be cloaked as well.														
988	4	4	Flying Raijin	Hiraishin no Jutsu	The user claps their hands and may swap places with any projectile they've thrown in the thread. The chosen projectile does not need to be in eyesight, but it does need to be motionless relative to the user. If this is used in combat, it consumes a kawarimi usage. If used out of combat, it cannot transport the user farther than one mile, but up to 3 other individuals may be transported alongside the user. Stage Five: 1 other consenting person may be swapped together with the user.														
988	4	5	Needle Art: Shower of Needles	Senbon Ninpou: Senbon no Uchuu	A seal is carved into a projectile, which causes light to refract off it abnormally when in midair. Anyone staring at the projectile will see numerous copies of it, like the reflections of a prism, spreading out radially from the original projectile. No matter what direction one looks at the projectile from, it always seems to be pointed right at them. The effect ends when the original projectile hits a surface or is otherwise intercepted.														
988	4	6	Needle Memorial	Hari-Kuyo	A single projectile is thrown that attaches a seal to whatever target it strikes. For the next 3 posts, at any point the user may snap their fingers, and the target or object with the seal on it will immediately be safely teleported back to the location where they were originally struck. Large projectiles have their seal last for the duration of the thread. The seal can be removed by a counter sealing technique, the medical extraction technique, or by carving it out. The seal disappears by itself once used.														
988	5	1	Iron Maiden	Kurugane Fuushuku	A bunshin of the user is created using a held projectile, rooted right in the spot where the technique is used. This bunshin has the same stats as the user (including taijutsu bonuses), but cannot move from where it was created and can only attack using copies of the original projectile it was created from. This bunshin can also use 1 projectile ninjutsu the user has access to without disappearing. The bunshin falls apart in 3 posts, or if struck once. Power 25: The bunshin can be created on top of any projectile the user has thrown in the thread. Power 32: The bunshin can survive 2 hits and use 2 jutsu.														
988	5	2	One Thousand Projectiles	Issen Yadama	After using this technique the user must stand in one spot, and pick out a specific location (not a target) to aim at, which cannot be altered once the technique begins. Then for the duration of the post they may throw as many projectiles as desired or as possible at that location, bombarding that spot and a 20 foot radius around it with their technique. This requires such a blinding amount of speed that steam is often seen rising off the user's body and fingertips as they do this.														
988	5	3	Cutting Wind	Tachi no Kaze	A projectile is thrown, which upon landing places a seal on the surface it touches. This seal empty a 25 foot radius air for 2 posts after impact, or until the original projectile is removed from the radius of the seal. The lack of air is extremely loud and noticeable, but once the technique end the area becomes immediately breathable again. This also removes and prevents smoke (normal or from a jutsu) and puts out natural fires. Large projectiles last 2 additional posts.														
988	5	4	Cherry Inferno	Outou Shounetsujigoku	Every intact projectile thrown by the user currently in their line of sight explodes like a base effect Outou no Bakudan (Cherry Bomb) jutsu. Large projectiles explode with maximum scaling.														
988	5	5	Liquid Metal Blood Congestion	Ekitai Kinzoku Juuketsu	A thrown projectile that breaks the skin infects the blood of the target, leaving a liquid silver seal at the impact site. Unless the target uses an antidote or similar poison-removing technique, 1 post later they will begin to cough and hack up sharp steel projectiles, which severely damage the throat and mouth on their way up. This lasts for 2 posts. If the original projectile was Large, this lasts 3 posts instead, and the size of the projectiles being expelled increases with every post.														
988	5	6	Penetrating Throw	Kantsuu Entou	Two seals also form under each foot, which root the user in place, and a special seal appears on the user's forehead which signifies this technique is active. The user must remain standing still, but so long as they do not remove their feet from the top of the seals, they gain 3 Levels of Strength and Speed for the purposes of throwing projectiles. While this technique is active the user also suffers a penalty of 3 Levels of Speed and Strength (to a minimum of 1) for all other taijutsu performed. This technique may be maintained indefinitely until the feet are removed from the seals, and once broken the penalties linger for 1 post afterwards. Large projectiles thrown with this technique will hit as if they were Stage Six ninjutsu in addition to their normal taijutsu Levels.														
988	6	1	Dagger Cascade	Otaki no Kaiken	After throwing a projectile, the user seems to disappear as well, only to reappear holding the projectile upon its impact. After pulling the projectile free the user may then throw the projectile again and repeat this process without consuming a usage. No other action may be taken apart from throwing the original projectile again, or this jutsu ends. This cycle may repeat indefinitely until otherwise uninterrupted, and can happen so rapidly that it may be done up to 3 times per post, but requires the projectile to land before it can be teleported to. This technique can only be '˜stopped' by hitting the user before they throw the original projectile again. Large projectiles used with this technique also let the user throw 1 normal projectile after reappearing as well.														
988	6	2	Projectile Explosion	Sakuretsu no Yadama	Over the course of two posts, the user throws 4 projectiles, eventually creating a 4 sided boundary. At the end of the second post, copies of the 4 projectiles begin to shoot inwards towards the other boundary points, spraying the area from all directions. The copies disappear on impact but otherwise carry the same power of a normal projectile thrown by the user. This continues indefinitely, until 2 of the original projectiles are removed or destroyed. Large projectiles used for this jutsu, and their copies, explode with the force of an explosive tag once the jutsu is broken.														
988	6	3	Flaming Projectile Wave	Akaakato Nami no Yadama	The user's entire body appears to become covered with ghostly blue flame after using this technique. Trails of fire are emitted whenever the user throws a projectile while this is active. Anyone who crosses or touches these trails of fire will feel their entire body burn as if they were engulfed in flames, and the sensation is real enough to cause those of lesser constitutions to pass out. Large projectiles leave behind the same trail of fire, but instead cause actual flames to burst forth on those who touch the trails. This technique, the trails, and subsequent lingering effects, last for 3 posts.														
988	6	4	Triple Throwing Scroll	Sandangamae Entou no Ippuku	3 scrolls unravel and wrap around the user, forming 6 scroll-like appendages that float in the air. Each appendage can fire off its own independently aimed projectile, allowing the user to shoot 6 projectiles at the same or different targets each post. The scrolls will also automatically (even against the user's will) leap out and intercept any Stage Four or lower ninjutsu (from a friend or foe) that approaches them, blocking it and destroying themselves in the process. Lasts for 3 posts or until all 3 scrolls are consumed.														
988	6	5	Booming Wave	In'intaru Nami	An enormously loud projectile is thrown, deafening anyone within 10 feet of it while in flight and within 30 feet of its impact point. Those affected will be deaf for 2 posts unless treated by a medical jutsu. If a Large projectile is used, a shockwave follows the projectile, blasting those in its path with Strength Levels equal to the highest Stage known in this list, and blasting those at the impact point with twice this Strength Level.														
988	6	6	Chakra Prison	Chakra Kangoku	A projectile is thrown which attaches a seal to a living target it strikes. The seal lasts for the duration of the thread or until removed by a counter sealing technique, medical extraction technique, or if the flesh around the seal is carved off down to the bone. The seal burns hot and bright every time the user performs a ninjutsu, draining the affected targets of the same number and Stage of ninjutsu usages. These losses are '˜virtual', though, and are returned if the seal is removed at any point in the thread. If the affected target does not have a usage to consume in that Stage, they are overcome by an immense fatigue for that post, and are at risk of passing out completely. Those affected will have a gut feeling about how much chakra they are losing, and will suffer the penalty should they use techniques that drain them past 0 usages.														
988	7	1	Feast of Banners	Tango no Sekku	A seal appears on the forehead of the user, signifying this technique is active. Holding onto a single hand seal along with a projectile, a single copy of that projectile emerges from some immobile surface within 5 feet of every living target within eyesight. This can even emerge from the surface of the target themselves. The copied projectile is fired and aimed however the user wishes. This technique can be held indefinitely so long as the user maintains their hand seal and grip on the original projectile, though targets within eyesight must be designated each post.														
988	7	2	Winter's Extreme	Dongzei	All projectiles in a 200 foot radius around the user are frozen, including projectile ninjutsu Stage Six or lower. Any offensive action farther than arm's reach from a person is considered a '˜projectile' for the purposes of this technique. Every affected jutsu or projectile gains a small blue seal on it that is cold to the touch. The user may selectively removed the seals from certain projectiles, and exclude them from this effect. Lasts 3 posts, after which the frozen projectiles and/or ninjutsu are again released. This technique is known for causing a substantial and unnatural chill in the air, noticeable to all those affected by it.														
988	7	3	Projectile Overseer	Yadama Genbakantoku	The user points at a location or target, and a small seal appears on the surface. Then at the user's will, every projectile thrown by them in the thread may be launched towards that point. This does not have to be done all at once, and waves of projectiles can be launched as the user wishes for the duration of the seal. The seal itself lasts for 3 posts and its target/location can be changed each post, and cannot be removed through any means.														
988	7	4	Iron Sheet	Kurogane Bankin	The user takes a projectile and imbues it with a seal, then slams it into their body. Rather than hurting them, it sinks in, leaving a copy of the original seal on their flesh. From that point onward a copy of that projectile will be fired out from the user's body with perfect aim at every target that initiates a hostile action at the user, no matter the distance. If the user sustains damage from an attack while under this jutsu, any blood released from the injury can be instantly formed into additional projectiles (including Large projectiles), allowing them to use for no action or usage cost one Stage Five or lower technique from this list in that post. Lasts 3 posts.														
988	7	5	Seasonal Division	Setsubun	For 3 posts, every object thrown or touched by the user places a seal on targets that they hit, draining 2 Physical Levels from them and causing them to faint if this brings their Physical Levels to 0. This effect stacks over the 3 posts, and applies itself once per projectile. The seals can be removed (and the penalties negated) through normal seal-removing techniques. The user may at any point end this technique early and throw 1 projectile that places a much more difficult to remove seal on the target it hits, draining 6 Physical Levels (and causing unconsciousness at 0) for the remainder of the thread.														
988	7	6	Final Spear	Inbo Kyousha	A projectile is thrown into the air, where it seems to disappear. In the following post a meteorite-sized copy of that projectile can be seen burning up in the atmosphere far above. In the post following that one, the enormous projectile lands where the user was standing when the technique was first used, indiscriminately annihilating the area. Anything 10 feet around the impact site is completely vaporized, with the shockwave from the blast itself capable of toppling buildings and uprooting trees within a 100 foot radius around itself. If the user is still within the impact point (whether they are alive or dead), the blast radius increases to the size of a city block at the cost of obliterating their own body in the process. Considered a war crime by most civilized nations if used anywhere near a human settlement.														
987	1	1	Puppet Arts: Puppet Pointer	Kugutsu Gigei: Kugutsu Shishin	Although Kugutsu Shishin is a basic technique, it's utilitarian nature serves quite well in the field. After forming the three seals needed for this technique, the user pumps a minute burst of Chakra down the threads connected to the puppet of choice. Immediately after, the puppet will spin three times then point in the direction of the user's objective (ie. traveling to a town, it will point towards the town). It's also been known as a useful hunting and assassination tool by SUNA Puppeteers, whose targets often move throughout the day; with Kugutsu Shishin, they can regularly check up on where their victim has moved to. If trying to locate a person, this technique requires several things of the Puppeteer: knowledge of the person's full, real name (aliases will not work), their general location (what village they were last in), and an item of their target's belonging (a kunai, a strand of hair, etc).														
987	1	2	Puppet Arts: Casting Call	Kugutsu Gigei: Chuukin Omimai	Building off of the mundane Bunshin no Jutsu, Chuukin Omimai instead creates clones of the user's puppets. These clones are corporeal and possess 1/10th of the puppet's statistics and fall apart after one hit. Substantially weaker than the original machines, the clones possess no weapons beyond their body parts for punching and kicking. Base Effect: One puppet clone is created. Stage Two Effect: Two puppet clones are created. Stage Three Effect: Three puppet clones are created. Stage Four Effect: Four puppet clones are created.														
987	1	3	Puppet Arts: Miniaturization	Kugutsu Gigei: Kogotaka	A cute travel technique, when Kogotaka is performed on one of the user's puppets that he is touching, the puppet will shrink and become a keychain he can carry around handily. At the drop of a dime, though, the user can dispel the technique to call the puppets back to their full size and glory. This was mainly designed to marvel the children by making them see a giant puppet condense into a tiny figure. This can only be used on one's own puppets. This cannot be used in battle unless Miniaturizing puppets to escape.														
987	1	4	Puppet Arts: Forced Closure	Kugutsu Gigei: Kyouseiteki Heisa	While all Puppeteers are able to establish and sever the links between themselves and their puppets, this jutsu does so in a memorable fashion. After creating the Boar seal, the Puppeteer quickly cuts off the threads of Chakra to his puppets with a violent yank of his hands. Due to the volatile nature of the cut, the puppets will spasm uncontrollably for a few seconds afterwards, lashing out wildly with its body parts. While not particularly powerful, it can be quite the unexpected attack to land a puppet's fist or leg on an unwary opponent.

987	2	1	Puppet Arts: Still String	Kugutsu Gigei:Nao Ito	Nao Ito is a simple jutsu in itself. All it does is allow the Puppeteer to control his puppets through the normal Chakra strings, but without having to move his hands. Normal Puppeteers usually have to tug and pull on the strings to animate their minions, but with Nao Ito, his hands can be doing something entirely different - or not even moving - while the puppets are in motion.														
987	2	2	Puppet Arts: Crafty Snare	Kugutsu Gigei: Roukai Motsure	Puppet Equipment Requirement: String or Razor Wire or Bola Net By selecting the puppet equipped with the necessary arsenal, the user forms several handseals and flicks the threads attached to that minion. The puppet will then rush towards the target as its joints unexpectedly fall apart and shoot the limbs and head outwards. Trailing from the limbs and head (connecting all back to the chassis) will be the string/razor wire/bola net to create a bigger capturing net. The net is mundane in all aspects, but if the puppet is also equipped with poison, the lines of the net can be thoroughly doused in it. Base Effect: The net covers ten feet in diameter. Stage Three Effect: The net covers fifteen feet in diameter. Stage Four Effect: The net covers twenty feet in diameter. Stage Five Effect: The net covers twenty-five feet in diameter.														
987	2	3	Teachings of the Master	Kugutsu Gigei: Oshie no Kyoukan	Through the hard hours of practice, the Puppeteer can teach his puppets to fight as he does in martial styles. In bonding with his machines, he learns how to move them more efficiently, to control the flow of Chakra and harness the ultimate strength of his puppets. With Oshie no Kyoukan, one puppet can gain 1/10th of the Puppeteer's Taijutsu bonuses when in combat, though the Puppeteer must remain still while employing this technique - moving will automatically break the jutsu. Base Effect: One puppet can be enhanced with 1/10th of the user's Taijutsu bonuses. Stage Three Effect: One puppet can be enhanced with 1/3rd of the user's Taijutsu bonuses. Stage Four Effect: Two puppets can be enhanced with 1/3rd of the user's Taijutsu bonuses. Stage Five Effect: Two puppets can be enhanced with Ã‚Â½ of the user's Taijutsu bonuses.														
987	2	4	Puppet Arts: Dismantle One Shot	Kugutsu Gigei: Kaitai Ippatsu	Targeting one of his puppet's limbs (arm, leg, tail, or head is acceptable), the Puppeteer can detach that specific part from the puppet and control it with a single Chakra thread as it flies around. The end of this part is usually equipped with a kunai or blade so the user can still try to stab something if the main body of his puppet is immobile. Afterwards, the Puppeteer can reattach the part to the body without a hitch.

987	3	1	Puppet Arts: Subterranean Ambush	Kugutsu Gigei: Chichuu Fukuzei	Often times a straightforward attack yields no results, so a sneak attack is in order. Chichuu Fukuzei allows the Puppeteer to select one of his puppets and have it burrow underground to gain a superior, more surprising position and launch an attack. The puppet cannot both enter and exit the ground in the same post, and if the puppet remains too long underground, the Chakra threads will weaken and automatically sever, leaving the machine stuck down there until the Puppeteer can manually dig it out. Base Effect: One puppet can go underground for two posts at a time with a one post cooldown. Stage Four Effect: One puppet can go underground for three posts at a time with a one post cooldown. Stage Five Effect: Two puppets can go underground for three posts at a time with a one post cooldown.														
987	3	2	Puppet Arts: Reconstruction	Kugutsu Gigei: Saikenchiku	There are times when a puppet's limbs are forcibly ripped off from the chassis or small pieces (such as hands or digits) are chipped off when they are vital to the overall operation of the machine. Sakenchiku allows the Puppeteer to make an impromptu 'repair' of sorts, by using Chakra threads to reconnect the separated pieces back to the whole. However, the joints involved still function awkwardly and can only act at 1/3rd of the original statistics. This technique does not allow for an actual puppet repair - if the puppet or puppet part is torn apart and crushed into shrapnel, Saikenchiku will do nothing - this is strictly a small scale, temporary technique until the Puppeteer can bring his creation back to an actual workshop for extensive reconstruction. Base Effect: One piece can be reattached. Stage Four Effect: Two pieces can be reattached. Stage Five Effect: Three pieces can be reattached.														
987	3	3	Puppet Arts: Dismantle Full Machine	Kugutsu Gigei: Kaitai Tappuri Kiki	This technique can only be used on one puppet at a time, as it requires both hands until the Puppeteer attains Kugutsu no Jutsu IV (at which this jutsu only requires one hand). Essentially, the chosen machine will break apart into its various pieces: head, chassis, left upper arm, left lower arm, right upper arm, right lower arm, left upper leg, left lower leg, right upper leg, and right lower leg (one for each finger; two for each finger when Kugutsu no Jutsu IV is achieved). The user can then control each piece separately as they fly around, though bladed weapons are usually mounted on the limbs somewhere to stab a target.														
987	3	4	Puppet Arts: Liar's Sorrow	Kugutsu Gigei: Usotsuke Kanashisa	Based on a foreign children's fairy tale, this jutsu allows a puppet to unnaturally extend and lengthen a part for a farther reach. Most commonly for arms and legs, this means a puppet can punch or kick at a greater distance, which an enemy may not be expecting when standing a few feet away. Only legs, arms, and tails may be selected for the effect of this technique. Base Effect: One part can be extended ten feet. Stage Four Effect: One part can be extended twenty feet. Stage Five Effect: Two parts can be extended twenty feet.														
987	3	5	Secret White Technique: Innocent Spy	Shiro Higi: Ganzenai Saguri	The first in the line of Shiro Higi, this technique is the basis for which all subsequent similar jutsu revolve around and is a necessity to advance further in the path of the Secret White Puppeteer. Ganzenai Saguri requires the Puppeteer not be controlling any puppets for its duration, as full concentration and focus is needed to maintain it. Choosing a human as a target, the user will cast a single thread of Chakra that travels in a straight line. The thread will attach itself to whatever it touches first; while initially visible in its casting, once it connects, it turns invisible to all except the wielders of specialized Chakra-sensing doujutsu. If a connection is established with the target human, the Puppeteer will then be able to hear and see what the target hears and sees as long as the thread remains intact. However, the Puppeteer and target must remain within the range of the user's highest level of Kugutsu no Jutsu, otherwise the thread will break. Furthermore, if the target or the Puppeteer uses any Ninjutsu or Genjutsu during this technique, the thread will break. Base Effect: The thread lasts for three posts. Stage Four Effect: The thread lasts for four posts. Stage Five Effect: The thread lasts for five posts.														
987	3	6	Secret Red Technique: Subconscious Subversion	Aka Higi: Kaishiki Kairan	The first in the line of Aka Higi, this technique is the basis for which all subsequent similar jutsu revolve around and is a necessity to advance further in the path of the Secret Red Puppeteer. Kaishiki Kairan requires the Puppeteer not be controlling any puppets for its duration, as full concentration and focus is needed to maintain it. Choosing a human as a target, the user will cast a single thread of Chakra that travels in a straight line. The thread will attach itself to whatever it touches first; while initially visible in its casting, once it connects, it turns invisible to all except the wielders of specialized Chakra-sensing doujutsu. If a connection is established with the target human, the Puppeteer can, once per post, inject one of his own thoughts as a subconscious idea, command, or notion within the target's mind as long as the thread remains intact. It will appear in the target's head as one of his own natural thoughts, though is not at all forced to act on any subconscious command (such as 'kill yourself', 'betray your team mate') and can fully debate against it by himself. Usually used to implant false facts and lies, Kaishiki Kairan is a useful jutsu to use on treasonous informants leaking valuable information to enemy ears. The Puppeteer and target must remain within the range of the user's highest level of Kugutsu no Jutsu, otherwise the thread will break. Furthermore, if the target or the Puppeteer uses any Ninjutsu or Genjutsu during this technique, the thread will break. Base Effect: The thread lasts for one post. Stage Four Effect: The thread lasts for two posts. Stage Five Effect: The thread lasts for three posts.														
987	4	1	Puppet Arts: Hundred Grasp Manipulation	Kugutsu Gigei: Hyaku Shouaku Ayatsuri	A slight misnomer to make the technique sound more formidable than it is, Hyaku Shouaku Ayasturi involves the Puppeteer selecting one of his puppets and forming the handseals for this jutsu. After sealing completion, the chosen puppet will extend forth an arm, which will bend and crack open at the elbow; flowing forth will be a multitude of hands that stretch forth on bamboo extensions to try and grab onto a target. Even if they all miss, the target is often trapped within a forest of arms and is limited in movement. At a moment's notice, the arms can be severed neatly and detached from the main puppet. Base Effect: The hands cover a diameter of fifteen feet. Stage Five Effect: The hands cover a diameter of thirty feet. Stage Six Effect: The hands cover a diameter of forty-five feet.														
987	4	2	Puppet Arts: Area Assassination	Kugutsu Gigei: Kuiki Ansatsu	Heavily based upon an ancient technique created by a deadly criminal, Kuiki Ansatsu involves a puppet arm being stocked with senbon. While not requiring the arm be chock full of the needles, the less stored inside, the less effective this technique becomes. After finishing the handseals, the user flicks a single thread connected to the puppet's arm; the forearm will shoot off and rocket into the air above the target. As it arrives, the arm will split apart and launch cylindrical containers over a wide area, which also split apart and rain down senbon needles. While by itself Kuiki Ansatsu is not capable of dealing lethal damage, victims caught by the storm of senbon are left in great amounts of pain, resembling human pincushions and wide open to a follow up finishing blow by the Puppeteer. This can only be done on one puppet at a time, and the deployed arm can be reassembled and reattached to the puppet body using Saikenchiku or Tappuri Kiki Saikenchiku. Base Effect: The senbon cover a diameter of ten feet. Stage Five Effect: The senbon cover a diameter of twenty feet. Stage Six Effect: The senbon cover a diameter of thirty feet.														
987	4	3	Puppet Arts: Distance Manipulation	Kugutsu Gigei: Kyori Ayatsuri	Range can be quite a bothersome factor to try and keep in mind while in battle, as Kugutsu no Jutsu determines how far the puppet master can be before losing control of his puppets. Kyori Ayatsuri allows the Puppeteer to somewhat bypass the limitations of Kugutsu no Jutsu, using his own puppets as 'extension points' of his Chakra threads. After establishing a connection to a single puppet, the user will then touch that puppet and draw new Chakra threads to the next one, connecting the two. This effectively doubles (or triples, quadruples, quintuples, etc depending on the amount of puppets connected) the range of Kugutsu no Jutsu. However, it comes with a heavy price as only the puppet closest to the Puppeteer retains its full stats. Each puppet further out has the stats of the puppet previous in the chain, but reduced by half. For example, the puppet closest to the Puppeteer has 12 Strength/Speed/Stamina, which means the next puppet in the chain will have 6 Strength/Speed/Stamina, and the next will have 3 Strength/Speed/Stamina, and so on.														
987	4	4	Puppet Arts: Machine One Shot	Kugutsu Gigei: Kiki Ippatsu	Puppet Equipment Requirement: Two puppets (one of at least Large chassis size, the other equipped with some form of bladed weapon kunai-sized or tanto-sized) Rumoured to have descended from the Godaime Kazekage's older brother, Kiki Ippatsu is a complex technique that requires several specific puppet builds to work. The first, larger puppet will sneak up or directly assault the victim and swing its chassis panels wide open. If successful in engulfing the target, the chassis panels will slam shut and lock, making escape impossible - this stage is the crux of Kiki Ippatsu. After that occurs and the victim is trapped, the smaller puppet will break apart into its pieces, each with a blade on its end, and ram themselves into the larger puppet's chassis in multiple locations. Effectively stabbing the prisoner several times, Kiki Ippatsu can end in death or at least unconsciousness from rapid blood loss. Before being impaled, though, the prisoner can break out if his Strength Level (or value, if they are equal in level) is greater than the puppet's Strength Level, or with a Ninjutsu equal or higher in stage than the Puppeteer's highest level of Kugutsu no Jutsu.														
987	4	5	Puppet Arts: Machine Customization	Kugutsu Gigei: Kiki Kasutamuka	There are unfortunate situations where puppets are not individually properly equipped to handle an opponent, but if they were to combine parts, would form a winning solution. Kiki Kasutamuka allows the Puppeteer to swap parts amongst his creations without suffering any disadvantage save for the exchanging puppets losing a quarter of their statistics for the rest of the thread until they exchange back. However, the rest of the regular puppetry rules remain - large parts cannot fit upon smaller chassis, and so on. Base Effect: One part may be swapped between puppets. Stage Five Effect: Two parts may be swapped between puppets. Stage Six Effect: Three parts may be swapped between puppets.														
987	4	6	Open Slot																
987	5	1	Puppet Arts: Maddening Rotation	Kugutsu Gigei: Kuruoshii Kaiten	Designed as an improvement over Kyouseiteki Heisa, Kuruoshii Kaiten operates in the exact same way, but with an expanded result. Instead of simply thrashing about, the puppets spin wildly with any bladed weapons extended, chasing after the enemy. In such a frenzied state, the spinning is so rapid that the puppet can chip away at stone and bash through saplings. Once the technique ends, though, the puppets are unable to be connected to for one post, leaving the Puppeteer vulnerable for that time period. 17 Power: The puppets will spin for one post. - 24 Power: The puppets will spin for two posts. - 31 Power: The puppets will spin for three posts. 16 Control: Kuruoshii Kaiten can be used on one puppet at a time. - 24 Control: Kuruoshii Kaiten can be used on two puppets at a time. - 32 Control: Kuruoshii Kaiten can be used on three puppets at a time.														
987	5	2	Puppet Arts: Consciousness Transfer	Kugutsu Gigei: Ishiki Tensou	Inspired by the Shintenshin of the Yamanaka, Ishiki Tensou transfers the puppeteer's mind into any one of his puppets. He - quite literally - brings the puppet to life and can manually control the puppet while in its body (retaining full Taijutsu bonuses). While in this form, the puppeteer's human form will be in a comatose state and all other puppets he was controlling will be unoperational until the puppeteer's consciousness returns to his own body. However, there is a risky flipside to using this technique. The puppeteer can only safely remain within the chosen puppet's body for a certain time before getting stuck in that puppet forever, unable to transfer back - life as a puppet is not grand; they will not be able to move unless another Puppeteer controls them through Chakra threads. At any time before the limit is passed, he can snap back into his human body; the threads of any puppets he had been controlling at the time will resume automatically (Chakra strings will restore themselves). If the puppeteer is transferred and the puppet is destroyed, his consciousness will immediately return to his normal body, leaving him slightly dazed. While in a puppet, the Puppeteer can use jutsu covered by his highest level of Technique Adaptation. 17 Tactics: The user can transfer for two posts at a time with a one post cooldown. - 24 Tactics: The user can transfer for four posts at a time with a one post cooldown. - 31 Tactics: The user can transfer for six posts at a time with a one post cooldown.														
987	5	3	Puppet Arts: Protector of the Sanctuary	Kugutsu Gigei: Naijin no Hogosha	While most jutsu involving puppets are offensive in nature, Naijin no Hogosha is the first truly defensive jutsu in puppetry. By calling a large puppet to his aid, the Puppeteer can either enter and hide inside the chassis of it or use it as a wall to seek shelter behind from enemy attacks. By reinforcing the puppet's material with Chakra, the puppet is able to withstand the assaults without taking any structural damage - unless the attack is too strong, at which the puppet will begin to shatter and break apart. Due to the excess amount of Chakra in its form, though, the puppet is unable to move while this technique is being used. 18 Power: The puppet can shield against Stage Four Ninjutsu and Stage Three Taijutsu. - 25 Power: The puppet can shield against Stage Five Ninjutsu and Stage Four Taijutsu. - 32 Power: The puppet can shield against Stage Five Ninjutsu and Stage Five Taijutsu														
987	5	4	Puppet Arts: Mega Size	Kugutsu Gigei: Megasunpou	Building upon the foundation of Usotsuke Kanashisa, this technique instead amplifies the total dimension of a singular puppet in the Puppeteer's arsenal. Under the influence of Megasunpou, the puppet of choice is enlarged twofold, so while it may have originally been five feet in height, it grows to ten feet. Weapons stored remain the original dimension, untouched by the jutsu; the puppet's Speed is effectively cut in half while Strength is doubled (Stamina remains the same). No other puppets can be manned while the user controls the doubled puppet with both hands. 18 Tactics: The jutsu lasts for two posts with a one post cooldown. - 25 Tactics: The jutsu lasts for three posts with a one post cooldown. - 32 Tactics: The jutsu lasts for four posts with a one post cooldown.

987	6	1	Puppet Arts: Deathly Fumes	Kugutsu Gigei: Tsuchiiro Kemuri	Puppet Equipment Requirement: Lethal Poison equipped to a puppet Developed by one of the most powerful Puppeteers in the history of Sunagakure, Tsuchiiro Kemuri was designed as a stealthy method of assassination. Selecting one of his puppets and completing the handseals for the jutsu, the Puppeteer then flicks the threads controlling that minion. One of the joints on the puppet (can be an elbow, wrist, knee, jaw, etc) swings open and releases a heavy purple stream of cloud - a modified lethal poison. Enhanced and mutated within the puppet by Chakra, the poison is now gaseous and has its effects slightly delayed. The cloud billows outwards and can either be ingested through inhalation or through contact with the skin (seeping through the pores and into the bloodstream) if victims remain within it for one post. The poisonous cloud will then fade, leaving no trace of its presence. Any infected with the poison will receive no symptoms at first, but on the next post will experience cringing pains. Within five posts' time, if they have received no medical treatment from a Jounin level medic, they will instantly fall dead and the poison will dissipate from the body as if it were never there. 21 Power: The cloud lingers for one post. - 28 Power: The cloud lingers for two posts. - 35 Power: The cloud lingers for three posts. 20 Control: The cloud covers a diameter of fifteen feet. - 28 Control: The cloud covers a diameter of twenty-five feet. - 35 Control: The cloud covers a diameter of thirty-five feet.														
987	6	2	Puppet Arts: Machine Projection	Kugutsu Gigei: Kiki Tousha	A cunning technique, Kiki Tousha was designed to combat against agile opponents. Upon activation after the user's handseals, the puppet will emit visible Chakra threads from all over its frame. The Chakra threads will attach to whatever they strike first (and then turn invisible except to Chakra-sensing doujutsu), but all those not connected to a human or animal body will immediately fade - after which the Puppeteer can cancel out any other remaining threads. From that point on for as long as the threads exist, when the puppet fires its projectiles, the projectiles will travel along the Chakra threads as if magically guided to the target (though this doesn't make it an autohit as the target can still knock them out of the air). The threads can be broken prematurely if the origin puppet is struck in any manner. Each puppet part (excluding the chassis) fires off two threads. 21 Tactics: The threads last for one post. - 28 Tactics: The threads last for two posts. - 35 Tactics: The threads last for three posts. 20 Intelligence: The threads can be shot out a maximum of fifteen feet. - 28 Intelligence: The threads can be shot out a maximum of thirty feet. - 35 Intelligence: The threads can be shot out a maximum of forty-five feet. 19 Willpower: Kiki Tousha can be done with one puppet at a time. - 28 Willpower: Kiki Tousha can be done with two puppets at a time. - 37 Willpower: Kiki Tousha can be done with three puppets at a time.														
987	6	3	Puppet Arts: Full Machine Reconstruction	Kugutsu Gigei: Tappuri Kiki Saikenchiku	As a definite upgrade to Saikenchiku, this version of the technique is a handy one learned by most advanced Puppeteers of Sunagakure. If a puppet part or a whole puppet is ever broken into pieces and shattered, unable to be covered by Saikenchiku, Tappuri Kiki Saikenchiku allows for a complete repair of the damaged machine - so long as all the parts still exist. If an arm was incinerated into slag by fire, the puppet will still be missing its arm after undergoing this jutsu. However, it's still a clutch technique to have when caught in a pinch. This jutsu can only be used on one puppet at a time with a cooldown of one post, and takes up the entirety of the Puppeteer's post (both offensive and defensive action). 23 Power: This jutsu can be done once per thread. - 30 Power: This jutsu can be done twice per thread.														
987	6	4	Puppet Arts: Godly Sacrifice	Kugutsu Gigei: Shinjin Gisei	Special Requirement: Admin approval Puppet Equipment Requirement: At least two puppets This jutsu was, for a certain time period, considered to be Kinjutsu and was outlawed for its nigh-unlimited potential within puppetry. Over time, though, people forgot about the technique as it passed down from precious few Puppeteer masters to even fewer students, until it eventually resurfaced under its current name. It allows Puppeteers to enhance their puppets to an insane degree by passing on half of one machine's statistics onto another, thereby boosting up the capability of that lucky unit. The more puppets one has, the greater a minion can be empowered; the limit, though, is that it is all or nothing - only one puppet can be enhanced, even if the Puppeteer commands ten puppets (in other words, the bonuses cannot be spread around; all must be concentrated on a singular puppet). The creations that sacrificed half of their statistics are then unable to be controlled for the next five posts and simply fall limp to the ground. The enhanced puppet, after the technique ends, has its statistics cut down to 1/5th of its original state for two posts, making this quite the double-edged jutsu. 23 Tactics: Shinjin Gisei lasts for one post. - 30 Tactics: Shinjin Gisei lasts for two posts. - 37 Tactics: Shinijn Gisei lasts for three posts.

987	7	1	Puppet Arts: Last Sealing	Kugutsu Gigei: Igen Houin	Special Requirement: Sealing Tags By taking all of the sealing tags on hand and clumping them into a ball, the Puppeteer holds them together with an exorbitant amount of Chakra. After one post of charging the sphere, the user can then throw the ball at will; it travels in a straight line, but as it hurtles towards its victim, it transforms into a ferocious looking white animal head with several rows of teeth. The longer the target waits to dodge, the worse it becomes because the head actually accelerates in its flight, picking up an enormous amount of speed. When it hits something, the teeth extend to trap the target; at that point, the victim is finished, because all of his Chakra is henceforth sealed. Unable to perform even the simplest jutsu, the prisoner can only escape if the Puppeteer commands the seal to recede, or if an ally crushes the seal with a Taijutsu technique equal or greater in stage to this one, or with Stage Six (and higher) Ninjutsu.														
987	7	2	Puppet Arts: Giga Size	Kugutsu Gigei: Kyosunpou	An extremely fearsome technique when used on the right puppet, Kyosunpou amplifies a single puppet's overall size by three times its original dimensions. Weapons and such remain the same size, but the puppet's Strength is tripled and Speed reduced to a third (Stamina remains constant). While no other puppets can be controlled or jutsu used - save for those under Technique Adaptation - during this technique as the Puppeteer requires both hands, he has in his command a formidable machine to operate. This lasts for three posts, after which the targeted puppet cannot be operated in any way for two posts.														
987	7	3	Puppet Arts: Mutated Puppet	Kugutsu Gigei: Henka Kugutsu	Often times, Puppeteers who have reached this stage of mastery are weak in body and prone to attacks. Using Henka Kugutsu, the master is able to turn himself into his own puppet. While no other units can be controlled during this time, the Puppeteer creates ten Chakra threads (one per finger) and attaches them all about his body. At this point, he is much more dexterous with his hands and fingers than with his entire form and is able to fight at a higher capacity. Effectively, by making himself into his own puppet, the user's Physical stats are now dictated by his Chakra stats (just like a puppet, Power translates into Strength, Control to Speed, Reserves to Stamina), with Taijutsu bonuses added. While Ninjutsu and Genjutsu cannot be used during this time, the Puppeteer becomes ten times better with his body than before, all through the mastery of puppetry. Henka Kugutsu can only be done once per thread for three posts (it must be sustained til its end once started) due to the great strain it places on the body, and for two posts afterward the Puppeteer is exhausted and unable to move.														
987	7	4	Machinery Substitution	Kugutsu Gigei: Kiki Daigae	Special Requirement: Admin approval to obtain, admin approval to use A Puppeteer's body is his weakest point, and while he does everything he can to maintain its healthy status, factors such as disease can often claim parts of it. With Kiki Daigae, a Puppeteer is able to substitute one of his (registered) puppet parts as one of his own, with all of its stored weaponry. This does not mean he can gain a third arm, but rather replace one that has been lost as a pseudo-prosthetic. A disadvantage is that the remaining 10 WP the Puppeteer receives is reduced to one, permanently (no matter the amount of AP or thread points used to try and gain extra afterwards). The process of attaching a puppet part to a human being is an excruciating one and requires one full thread to accomplish - because of the tolling effects on the body, this can only ever be done once in a lifetime.														
987	7	5	Secret Red Technique: Hundred Manipulation	Aka Higi: Hyaku Shouaku	Releasing control of all but one puppet for the duration of this jutsu, the Puppeteer places ten Chakra threads with both hands onto the last unit. Forming handseals for one post prior to activation (no offensive actions can be made during this time), the one puppet is multiplied one hundred times - in number, not size. However, only the original retains its statistics; the other ninety-nine puppets carry 1/10th of its statistics and are only equipped with kunai (non-launchable). Because of such great numbers, the Puppeteer is unable to command each one individually; the packed mob must be guided and directed exactly as that: a mob.														
987	7	6	Secret White Technique: Reincarnation	Shiro Higi: Tensei	This is the final act of any Secret White Puppeteer to combat those of the Secret Red. Long ago, techniques existed (and it is rumoured they still exist today) to turn human bodies into puppet frames; Tensei was invented by a village elder to do the exact opposite: turn puppets back into living humans. An unexpected side-effect was that it could also resurrect deceased humans, so long as their bodies had not yet fully decayed. Taking three posts to mold the entirety of his Chakra, the Puppeteer transfers all of that Chakra and life essence into the body or the human puppet. Immediately the corpse is revived as a living, breathing human, or the puppet is transformed back into a living human, both with memories and jutsu intact. The Puppeteer, however, has made the greatest sacrifice and, in three posts (or the end of the thread), dies.														
987	8	1	Secret Red Technique: Human Puppet Domination	Aka Higi: Hito Kugutsu Seiha	This technique is where the divergence between the Secret Red and Secret White is evident; taking five consecutive posts to place a seal on an unconscious (or, strangely enough, willing) target, the Puppeteer turns the sealed person into a puppet of sorts. By placing subconscious commands such as, 'Meet me every third Monday of the month,' the Puppeteer can make a very useful spy out of the victim. Whenever the commands are activated through a designated trigger ('Whenever you see a kunai'), the victim is overcome with an urge to follow through with whatever they were ordered to through the seal. While it is possible to break the seal, it requires a tremendous amount of Chakra to do so - after, of course, somehow discovering the seal has been placed on you despite having no memory of the sealing process.														
987	8	2	Secret Red Technique: Human Puppets	Aka Higi: Hito Kugutsu	One of the most fearsome techniques in existence, Hito Kugutsu takes a human corpse and transforms it into a puppet. While the frame is in no way convincing enough to pass off as a human, the strength of this kinjutsu lies in that the puppet retains all of its Chakra from when it was alive. Kekkai genkai are preserved through the process of human puppification, and the puppet can use any jutsu and Taijutsu it knew up and including Stage Four (though it's jutsu uses per thread are halved) along with those covered by Technique Adaptation. To control a human puppet, though, requires a full hand of the Puppeteer.														
987	8	3	Secret Red Technique: Human Puppet Transfer	Aka Higi: Hito Kugutsu Tensou	Only the most dreadful of Puppeteers could ever make use of this technique, and only the most desperate of Puppeteers would hope to learn it. For those who seek the preservation of life, to triumph over death and attain immortality, Hito Kugutsu Tensou is their path. Taking one full thread to do so, the Puppeteer undergoes a painstaking process to condense their Chakra and life essence into a canister, which is then quickly placed into a puppet chassis (takes up 5 storage slots on its own). In the next post, the human body dies from a complete lack of Chakra and consciousness; however, the user lives on through his puppets, and is able to transfer from machine to machine as he pleases. Doing so takes up both the offensive and defensive action of the post.														
987	8	4	Secret White Technique: Human Puppet Show	Shiro Higi: Hito Kugutsu Kyouran	While this technique may be similar in nature to Secret Red Techniques, in actuality it serves a much more benign purpose. The Puppeteer, after choosing an ally and completing the handseals, casts ten Chakra threads (one per finger) upon him or her; that person then becomes the human puppet of the Secret White Puppeteer. While it is difficult to get detailed and precise motions, the Puppeteer can guide and direct his subject with his hands, making the person much more agile than before. Effectively, this adds on half of the Puppeteer's Control statistic onto the target's Speed statistic. However, it is not perfect, as it requires absolute synchronization - if the target were to try and move in a different direction than the threads suggested, the Control bonus is negated for one post and Speed is cut in half.														
987	8	5	Secret White Technique: Group of Ten of the Chikamatsu	Shiro Higi: Jikki Chikamatsu no Shuu	Chikamatsu Monzaemon was the first Puppeteer to ever emerge within the Shinobi world; he boasted great prowess in the art, able to manipulate ten at a single time with one puppet per finger. It was said that Monzaemon conquered an entire castle with just his ten.

986	1	1	Balance		Eating dirt is never fun, and falling from high places is even worse. Extensive training in steadying your body can help prevent falls the first time, and furthermore help to steady high landings. You now have the power to run steady over even small beams or poles, and need not fear a slip or fall on slippery surfaces. But beyond that, you will not be hurt if you fall from a height equal to or lower then your stamina with bonuses in feet.														
986	1	2	Coded language		Two people who have this skill can speak to each other in coded language. This allows them to strategize right in front of an enemy without them understanding a word that is going on. This only works if both people with this skill previously knew each other (were in the same thread or are part of the same organization or clan.)														
986	1	3	Magician's escape		Put under lock and key, bound with rope, a mercenary has to be ready for just about any form of imprisonment. Being bound by rope or simple shackles is no problem, and the mercenary's knowledge of different locks or knots can easily make these obsolete. This skill takes one whole post, but any non-chakra enhanced rope or shackles can be removed through proper manipulation of joints and bone, or simple untying/unlocking. (For your escape or another's).														
986	1	4	Play Possum		A childish tactic enhanced through controlled breathing and good acting. Sometimes you just want someone to think you've bit the bullet, and that's all there is to it. To the untrained observer, the mercenary will seem pretty dead. Slowed controlled breathing, controlled heartrate, and good body positioning is as far as this technique goes though, as anyone with enough medical knowhow would be able to foil the mercenary's ruse.

986	2	1	Eyes of the Mercenary		Smoke clouds, steam clouds, explosions, people are always trying to put something between you and your target. But you'd be surprised how little obstructions like these matter to the trained eye of a mercenary. Though details are lost, the general position and shape of an object can still be infered through a cloud of smoke. This skill shows that the mercenary can see general objects through any non-chakra enhanced clouds. While they cannot see in detail, they can still make out objects and movements.														
986	2	2	Acrobatic Leap		Ninja's have it easy, using chakra to bound high into the air without much physical effort. Mercenaries need to learn how to do this safely, and after much practice can effectively double their vertical leap, though it's rather painful to do so. The increase in vertical leap makes long horizontal leaps possible as well.														
986	2	3	Steady Mind I		A passive series of anti-genjutsu techniques. A mercenary's training consists of the knowledge of common illusions that may be used against you. This prior knowledge helps a mercenary find the common fallacies or problems that are prevalent in many illusions and makes it simpler to break free of them. For Genjutsu Stage 2 and Below, the user is considered to have 1 stage of genjutsu training.														
986	2	4	Impeccable Memory		A trained eye is useful when on the prowl With this skill, you can remember in good detail an object that you saw, heard, tasted, or smelled within the thread, or even across threads if it pertains to a particular object. This allows absolute recall in great detail, enough that you could accurately picture the exact scene and details unless they have been otherwise altered. If your intelligence is above 10, you can make exact sketches or recreations of that object in a medium of your choice.

986	3	1	Hunter's Instinct		Who knows who or what you will have to track when on the job, so it is best to just be ready for it all. When people are in a rush to get from point A to point B, they leave small clues to their movements. Footsteps, broken branches, nipped clothing, and strong odors. Noticing and following these is slow and methodical, but possible with practice and training. Any target you have fully identified (what they look like, what they are wearing, etc.) you can track their location for up to a mile before their trail goes cold. This can also be used to guess the location of those moving between nearby brush.														
986	3	2	Effortless Ascent		Constant training of the body lends to amazing physical feats over the years, some more useful then others. This skill acknowledges the all too popular '˜wall run' that many hope to achieve. Gaining a running momentum, the mercenary can now run up a solid vertical surface to a height up to four times their own.														
986	3	3	Lucky Bastard		One of the most important techniques for a warrior. On top of all your physical fitness and expertise, you just need to be darn lucky. Lucky you tripped on that rock while a kunai was coming at you, or picked up that penny when that fireball nearly hit you. This skill allows you to RP your way out of any one physical hit. Only useable once per thread (Still gotta figure yourself a way out of it though. No effect on genjutsu.)														
986	3	4	Catch		While many just give up and take the blow when a weapon is launched at them, an agile mercenary can catch some items and throw them back before their effect goes off. This is extremely useful for things like smoke bombs or things that should explode on impact. A gentle hand can catch them and return them to sender without them detonating on you or harming you.

986	4	1	Eagle Eye		Without the ability to enhance vision or accuracy with ranged weaponry, Non-shinobi need practice, practice, practice. This is the final sign of that practice. Accuracy up to 60 yards is 100% on a still target without outside interference.														
986	4	2	Wall Bound		Nearing the peak of normal human physical fitness, those who have come this far know that you always need a new trick to show. Using careful balance and concentration allows a mercenary to jump from any solid surface as if it was a floor. This allows the mercenary to jump as high as they usually could off a vertical surface, or whatever other angle they may find themselves at. This can only be used once a post, but Mercenary's with 20 strength or higher can Wall Bound off two surfaces.														
986	4	3	Steady Mind II		A passive series of anti-genjutsu techniques. At this stage, a mercenary is well versed in more complex illusions that may be brought against it, this includes strenuous psychological training to come to terms with loves lost, dead family, and training on how to stay on task. For genjutsu Stage 4 and below, the user is considered to have two stages of genjutsu training.

986	5	1	Total silence		Without the assistance of chakra, it takes hard training to learn to be completely silent. Slow and steady movement mixed with a trained breathing pattern makes you completely silent to anyone that doesn't have some special way of hearing you. Course they can still see and smell you, so be careful. The mercenary can only move at half speed. Base Effect: 1 post duration - Strength 23: 2 post duration -- Strength 30: 3 post duration														
986	5	2	Blade Catch		An advancement of the basic tenets of catching thrown items. Advanced hand eye coordination is used to accurately catch a blade with two hands, and be perfectly unharmed by the cut of the blade. This is only possible if the Mercenary's Speed or Strength (whichever is higher) is higher then the attackers Strength.														
986	5	3	Nerve Pinch		A move best used in stealthy situations, this is a full gripped pinch to the nerves along the neck. This will send anyone sorry enough to be hit by it into a short rest. This is hard to pull off on anyone that is able to move away from your grasp, as the nerves have to be specifically struck, but against those that are currently bound or that aren't aware of your presence, it can be a powerful tool. Those knocked out will only stay under for 3 post, and are easily woken by a good shaking.

986	6	1	Steady Mind III		A series of anti-genjutsu techniques. At this level, the most advanced of illusions are trained for. These genjutsu are known for deeply altering a person mentally and previous anti-genjutsu training is of little to no use, so a more drastic measure it taken. By folding the hands across each other, then bending fingers back in a way that causes extreme pain, the mind can be snapped back to attention by thinking it is taking pain greater then what is actually occurring. For stage 6 genjutsu and below, the user is considered to have 3 stages of genjutsu training.														
986	6	2	Murderer's Strike		This technique is a tried and true method to take down any target who falls under this blow. The strike takes complete concentration to perform, is fairly slow and obvious, so it must be done from a still stance. An open palmed strike is delivered to the target's chest, just below the heart. The area affected will instantly display a bright red bruise that will grow over the next 3 post. 3 Post after this technique is landed, the blood flow to the heart is stopped, and the target will slowly die. Any time during the 3 post between the technique's landing and death, chuunin level medical jutsu can heal the bruise and stop any future complications. Any hard armor or protection over the area will easily block this. Requires Opponent's Permission														
986	6	3	Perseverance		A strong mind and a strong body both together striving to continue on regardless of circumstance. Using this mild meditative technique, you can keep yourself up and moving as if you have not sustained any injury. You will not feel the broken foot, burning lungs, or searing flesh, and will move like normal (barring completely missing or dysfunctional body parts.) Can only be used once a thread.

985	1	1	Clone Technique	Bunshin No Jutsu	Trigger: Must be within eyesight of targets A jutsu that creates an illusionary clone of the user, in numbers of one or more. The clone disappears after being struck with an attack, and can deal no damage. This jutsu is one of the basics, and required to pass the shinobi academy. The user can create 1 Bunshin for every 2 control they have. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 6

985	1	5	Stupification Technique	Bouzenjishitsu no Jutsu	Trigger: Eye Contact The user locks eyes with the target and performs a quick single hand-seal.

He has been effectively made stupid for the duration. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 6

985	2	1	Demonic Illusion: False Surroundings Technique	Magen: Kokuni Arazu No Jutsu	Trigger: Within Eyesight of the performer. An illusion technique which disguises the surroundings as something else. For instance, you can make a classroom number that actually is room 201 appears as room 301... This will only work on targets no bigger than an adult man. The scene only changes, no animated illusions may be made all must be static. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
985	2	2	Demonic Illusion: Vision of Hell Technique	Magen: Narakumi No Jutsu	Trigger: Falling small debris A low-level illusion skill, which makes the opponent envision a very traumatic scene. After being put in some form of trance by leaves, grass, flower petals, and dust flying in front of the eyes, the target creates this vision himself. The jutsu only forces the target to think about the worst event possible for them, and then capitalizes on that by showing it happen. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
985	2	3	Sly Fellow Mind Skill	Kori Shinchuu no Jutsu	Trigger: Must be able to see the target This technique was developed in order to slow down an enemy's movement and confuse them while the user prepares an assault against them. It cannot be used once combat has started, therefore the user has to ensure that they are unseen by the enemy and hidden from their view. Then performing a series of seals, they create a powerful genjutsu that binds the selected targets to the area they are currently in. This means, every time the victims attempt to leave the area they will loop around and be straight back to the beginning. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
985	2	4	Track Covering Technique	Senro Ue Fuku no Jutsu	Trigger: Area of Effect: footprints This is a simple genjutsu that allows you to cover up foot prints in mud, snow, sand and grass. With each step the user takes they send a small burst of chakra to their feet. The chakra that is left on the ground where they stepped creates an illusion that makes it look like whatever element they were walking in hasn't been disturbed. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
985	2	5	Camouflage Technique	Meisai no Jutsu	Trigger: Must be able to see the enemy This skill allows the user to become transparent and slink into the confines of a natural resource. It takes a small amount of chakra to initiate but it can take quite a bit depending on how long you wish to stay camouflaged within the confines of the natural resource. Elaborating on natural resources, it must be something like a tree or the ground or a boulder that has not been created or shaped by mankind.

985	3	1	Heaven and Earth Reversal	Tenjou Gyakumodori	Trigger: Must be able to see the person, (single person) This simple genjutsu is one that is used for testing the skill, logic and handling pressure abilities of many academy students and genin. When applied on an opponent or a test subject, they will feel as if they are upside down with their feet still on the ground but feeling as if the direction of 'down' is the direction of the sky. This genjutsu puts much stress on the mind of an opponent, since there is a strong feeling (mainly because the user has suggested it into the opponent's mind) that if he\she would move one of their legs, he\she will 'fall' into the sky. This genjutsu is superb at testing which genin or academy student has the bravery of taking a calculated risk, and is most used by academy teachers, rather than in combat. There is a very easy way to defeat this genjutsu, hence its simplicity and the common use of it as a test: you only have to move one of your legs and the directions of up and down automatically right themselves.

985	3	3	Chained Mind Technique	Atama Kusari No Jutsu	Trigger: The Target must watch the hand gestures. This technique uses intricate hand movements and subtle chakra waves to render the target hypnotized and incapable of movement*. However, this effect will only last as long as the shinobi continues to perform the technique and the target can see the shinobi's hands. In other words, while performing this jutsu, you are helpless, but so is your target. (Similar to the Shadow Bind technique, but this genjutsu uses far less chakra). Ideally, this technique would be used as part of a team strategy. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Mx Duration: 5														
985	3	4	Fake Chakra Power	Ikamono Chikara no Chakra	Tigger: Enemies must watch the performer as jutsu is initiated. Another genjutsu that is meant to scare the opponent into surrendering or retreating. The shinobi makes it look like a glowing and sparkling chakra aura surrounds him/her, so that he/she is extremely powerful and dangerous. The color of the chakra is up to the user but it is often red, black or purple in order to make it look more evil and powerful. The enemy can see the chakra as well as feel its enormous (but fake) strength and presence. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
985	3	5	Instant Strike	Suguni Ouda	Trigger: Eye Contact For this technique the user must have eye contact with the target. A single hand seal is formed and the user vanishes with a loud bang. In an instant the user is standing in front of the target, a weapon (such as a kunai or katana) plunged into the opponent's body. The opponent feels a blast of pain and the shock of being stabbed, but then the illusion of the user vanishes, revealing it was merely genjutsu. This technique means to paralyze the target in temporary terror. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1

985	4	1	Inflict Emotion Technique	Ataeru Kanjoo No Jutsu	Trigger: Must see the hand-seal. This is a fairly high level genjutsu where the shinobi temporarily changes the emotions of the target to his/her liking. The emotions imparted can be anything from ecstasy, despair, overconfidence, grief, etc. One would be advised against using this technique on teammates, however. After the effect has passed, the victim remembers the one who used the technique, and almost always with hostility. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
985	4	2	Sleep	Nemuri	Trigger: Gentle Touch A genjutsu technique where the ninja places their hand on their target's shoulder and makes them feel like they are in a deep slumber. A useful technique when subterfuge is involved with a mission, but utterly useless in combat. Takes one full post to complete. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
985	4	3	False Summons Technique	Nise Shookanjoo No Jutsu	Trigger: The Enemies must be within eyesight of the performer. This crafty technique has the user mimic the hand gestures used to perform a summon; however, nothing is actually summoned except for an incredibly lifelike illusion shaped to the caster's will. Since the only thing being created is a chakra projection and not flesh, this genjutsu can be used by lower level shinobi who would normally not have the skills to perform an actual summon. The catch is that the shinobi's genjutsu skills will determine the size and detail of the chakra projection. (A genin might be able to create a false summons of a tracking dog, while a jounin could create a false summons of Gamabunta himself). The illusion is extraordinarily lifelike, in fact is indistinguishable from the real McCoy (of course, not to the Byakugan or Sharingan); its movements are controlled directly by the shinobi. If attacked, the chakra projection will stay there, but any decent ninja would figure out it's an illusion and simply ignore it then. The best use of this technique would be for intimidation or as a bluff ("that punk kid shouldn't be able to summon THAT! He must be a genius!"). Note: Making an illusion of higher level summoning can only be done by jounin-ranked genjutsu specialists. Anyone else is limited to medium-sized summons at best (Orochimaru's snakes at the Forest of Death, for example) Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
985	4	4	Heaven and Earth Reversal, Advanced Version	Koudo Tenjou Gyakumodori	Trigger: The user must be able to see the target This is the same genjutsu, but with a twist: When the subject of the jutsu eventually moves one of his\her feet, instead of directions returning to normal, he\she will start to 'fall' towards the sky. The advanced version of the genjutsu isn't used as a test as commonly as the simple version, mainly because at the wrong hands, the metaphorical fall may cause an actual literal jumping straight into the earth. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
985	4	5	Spiritual Possession	Kitsunetsuki	Trigger: Enemies must see the user complete the handseals. An upgrade of the Fake Chakra Power illusionary technique. The chakra aura becomes bigger and more intensified. The user's body starts to change into something evil, like a demon. The form is up to the user. He/she can grow longer sharper fingernails and teeth, change hair and eye and skin color, grow horns from anywhere on the body. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4

985	5	1	Visions of Paranoia	Genmu no Henshuubyou	Trigger: Area of effect with a radius of [(Willpower+Tactics+Intelligence)/3] meters This is an area effect that once the victim(s) have entered the area, for four posts they start to think that there are things watching them. The area effect makes it looks like there are shinobi in the trees or hiding. When seen through the corner of the eye they are there, yet upon moving the head to pinpoint the spies they seem to vanish. The technique stays even in a combat situation, and can be lethally distracting for the enemy. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
985	5	2	Internal Spawn Technique	Naisenranki no Jutsu	Trigger: Enemy must see the hand-seals performed. Once that target is caught in the genjutsu (by seeing the user perform sealing) they begin to feel something moving inside of them. In a few moments slimy, blood covered tentacles come out of every orifice (mouth, nose, ears, eyes anything else in your imagination, wounds) in their body. It tastes like blood and many other bodily fluids (and makes strange squelching sounds). One of the effects is causing a gagging reflex. This gives the feeling of a helpless sort of weakening on the body. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
985	5	3	Salvation Temple Technique	Nehan Shouja No Jutsu	Trigger: All in the surrounding area, including the performer. An illusion that is two fold. Firstly the targets will have their vision blurred by a thick scene of falling cherry blossoms. After this initial effect the affected people will feel exceptionally drowsy, comfortable and fatigued. This sets an illusionary perfect condition for sleep, it does not force sleep upon anyone. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
985	5	4	Smokescreen Technique	Enmaku no Jutsu	Trigger: Targets must see the performer when the final hand-seal is performed. Forming the hands into a seal, the user fills up the area with an illusionary smokescreen, impossible to penetrate with the eyes or ears. Only the user is not affected, and can use this as a perfect escape plan, or even an attacking strategy. However, the smoke cannot be felt or smelled, which may cause the enemy to realize it is an illusionary smokescreen. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4

985	6	1	Slow Down Skill	Kouchi no Jutsu	Trigger: The Target (single) must see the hand-seals performed. After performing the necessary hand seals the user may attack to the victim it takes fifteen seconds longer for the user to even do the attack. Essentially, this delays time by fifteen seconds for the target for the duration of the genjutsu. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3														
985	6	2	World of Illusion	Gensou no Udai	Trigger: The Target must be touched A technique that is meant to find out vital information from people without using physical torture, mostly on prisoners and captives. It cannot be used during battle. The target feels calm, peaceful and an intense desire to share all that he knows. Above all else the target feels an overwhelming feeling of trust for the performer of the genjutsu. The victim cannot see or hear any other enemies or allies, just the person performing the genjutsu. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3														
985	6	3	Body Stop Technique	Gotai Habamu no Jutsu	Trigger: The Target must see the hand-seals performed After forming the proper seals, the user seems to swirl and vanish into thin air. Instead of using a tree to trap the victim, it seems as though the user has appeared behind the enemy like a solid ghost, gripping the back of his neck with one arm. The victim feels a sense of paralysis settle over his body, and the user is free to do to his captive what he wants. The technique requires at least two posts: in the first, the user disappears (and the victim can still move), in the second the user re-appears and paralysis takes hold. The user of this genjutsu does not need to attack but may to make the illusion more real. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3														
985	6	4	Melting Flesh Skill	Hyoukai Nikutai no Jutsu	Trigger: the Target must see the hand-seals completed Upon watching the user form the necessary hand seals, the victim will see many chains suddenly surround and bind him to the ground, upright. Slowly, he will feel the flesh on his bones melt and drip to the floor, all over, on his limbs and torso and face. There is a great deal of illusionary pain involved, of course'Â¦ Even after the effects are over, the victim feels compelled to pat himself, just to make sure he isn't really melting.

985	7	1	Blood Itch Technique	Chishio Kayumi no Jutsu	Trigger: Eye Contact must be made. This requires eye contact with the enemy. Immediately after, the victim feels an incredible itching all over his body. If the target scratches then he feels relief and yet a more intense desire to scratch. The victim scratches harder, reddening his skin, and then harder still, eventually tearing some of his clothing and right into his own flesh. Still, the itching doesn't stop''it seems to be taunting him right from his very core. More than one shinobi to fall under this genjutsu has clawed himself right down to the bone. Any pain that results from this will not serve to reduce the duration. Min duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 3														
985	7	2	Mince Meat Brain	Tataki Nouzui	Trigger: Touch the head This requires the user to make physical contact with the head region of the intended victim, even if it is just a tap on the back of the head. After, the enemy will feel the urge to sneeze, and will do so'Â¦ but wait! What is that on his hands and the ground? To the victim, he will see a tiny puddle of slimy, slightly translucent fluid with little bits of pale-pink, squishy meat, and he realizes to his horror that he's just sneezed out a bit of his brain. Shocked, the genjutsu induces the victim to sneeze yet again, expelling more of his brain through his nose and mouth. The more panicked he becomes, the more he sneezes. The pain is intense and being exposed to this genjutsu for too long may reduce the victim to an incoherent babbling mess, so convinced is he that he's sneezed half his brains out. Proper counseling might help, if such is the case. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 3														
985	7	3	True Nightmare Technique	Jissei Muma no Jutsu	Trigger: Eye contact must be made with the target. This technique requires physical contact with the victim before it can take hold. The target falls into a state of a waking dream, only it isn't a dream, it is a nightmare. In this nightmare, he is attacked and shredded by wild beasts, monsters, demons, perhaps all three, and amazingly, he can feel the pain from his injuries but will not wake up. All reality is lost upon him and the dream becomes his reality. The screams from this sleeping torture are chilling to hear. After waking up, he may be afraid to sleep for several weeks. If the pain is intense enough and the duration long enough the brain may even shut down inducing an extended coma. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duratioin: 3														
985	7	4	Death God's Judgement	Seibai no Shinigami	Special: Admin approval Trigger: Eye contact must be made with the target. A technique that can literally scare an opponent to death. First everything becomes black around the victim and he/she can only see his/her own body. Suddenly a large spirit emerges in front of him/her'Â¦ the Death God himself! The sight of the God of Death paralyzes most victims in fear. The Death God moves his clawed arm into the chest of the victim without causing any physical wounds and starts to slowly pull out the victim's soul. The victim does not feel any physical pain but merely an extreme weakening as the very essence of life leaves him/her and then has to watch as the Death God devours the soul. The technique can leave psychological damage on the victim and can only be restored by a skilled jounin healer. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 3

984	1	1	War: Rage	Kousen: Gekido	A genjutsu that can be activated via eye contact and with a single hand seal. If the genjutsu hits the anger of the victim raises slightly. The anger is no more extreme than someone being annoyed to the point they want to physically harm an individual. The victim of the genjutsu can still distinguish between foe and ally. Durations: 1, 3, 6														
984	1	2	Famine: Hunger	Kyoukou: Kiga	Description:A very simple technique that only requires the user to start talking about food after using several hand seals. Upon hearing the user's voice, The affected will suddenly feel very hungry and may feel the urge to feed this craving. Eating something can be a quick cure for this genjutsu otherwise it may effect a shinobi's concentration. Durations: 1, 3, 6														
984	1	3	Plague: Annoying Cough	Soeki: Okkuu Seki	Using the hands to reveal that something is wrong with ones throat triggers this genjutsu if the opponent makes visual contact of the gesture. Once contact is made the opponent simply believes he has the urge the cough and may go into a coughing fit.This can easily disrupt a Shinobi's concentration. Durations: 1, 3, 6														
984	1	4	Death: Memories	Oujou: Iji	A rather simple technique that sadly takes a decent sum of chakra. Saying the words 'Never forget' (The enemy must hear it) activates this technique. The jutsu evokes simplified memories of dead family members or friends, maybe even an enemy. Usually the image is accompanied by them saying something rather chilling.

984	2	1	War: Assault	Kousen: Kagai	By simply forming several hand seals and laying a single finger on an enemy they can create the illusion of pain. For a brief amount of time, the nerves are tricked into believing that the area that the user has touched has been stabbed with a kunai. The 'pain' fades at the end of the duration, and merely serves to surprise their opponent. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	2	2	Famine: Malnutrition	Kyoukou: Eiyoushicchou	The user forms several handseals then places both hands on his stomach. If the opponent sees this movement, the Genjutsu will affect him. The enemy feels as if they haven't eaten in days. Oddly they do not feel hungry though, but they do feel tired. Their body doesn't want to move, they feel sore and heavy. In rare cases they may even be compelled to sleep. Simply moving can actually cancel out all of these effects. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	2	3	Plague: Spreading Sickness	Soeki: Hirogari Furei	A very odd technique that scares the enemy into thinking everyone around them is sick with a virus. After performing a series of handseals, the user can activate this technique simply by coughing, sneezing, or even spitting on a shinobi within the range of two feet. They think that everyone around them is sick and their mind actually shows everyone as being sick. The people in the area start coughing and sneezing and slowly start growing pale, they look sickly. The shinobi works very hard to avoid the sickly people. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	2	4	Death: Omen	Oujou: Zenpyou	The user performs a series of handseals, then slams both hands down on the floor. If the opponent sees this action, the technique is activated. This technique makes the enemy see signs around them that would suggest that they will die soon. Things like shadows in the shape of blades and monsters form around the user. Their eyes show them glimpses of things such as nooses hanging from trees or they may even see something dangerous from their past. These things only last for about a second before turning back into a shadow, hanging branch, rock, puddle, and so on. Durations: 1, 3, 5

984	3	1	War: The Sword's Silhouette	Kousen: Sono Ken kageboushi	The user forms a series of handseals then makes eye contact with the opponent. When eye contact is broken, the genjutsu is activated. The target sees the shadow of a meancing claymore on the ground before them. Nothing happens on the first post -- but by the 2nd post, a maniacal cackling comes from the shadow that seems to overwhelm all other sounds. In the cackling is a whisper that prompts the target to kill... to start a war. This technique can drive the opponent to believe that he is insane temporarily. At the end of the technique, the sword fades away as it lets out a blood-curdling screech. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	3	2	Famine: Starvation	Kyoukou: Kikatsu	An upgraded version of Kyoukou: Kiga no jutsu. This technique is again activated by the user talking about food, preferably one the intended target likes. The shinobi feels an undeniable pain in their stomach, they cannot ignore it. They feel like they haven't eaten in years and probably want nothing more but to fill their empty stomachs. This can easily grab a shinobi's attention and make it harder for them in battle. Upon that even if they do eat, they still do not feel satisfied. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	3	3	Plague: Decay	Soeki: Gensui	The user forms a series of handseals then says the word "decay". If the target hears it, the genjutsu is activated. The shinobi's eyes are tricked into seeing everything that he touches die. Grass turns yellow and brown as if scorched by a relentless sun... plants turn brown and wither with a single touch... animals keel over in pain and die before his very eyes. The illusion then directs the target to his allies, and even if they do not touch, the ally starts to turn black (as if they were withering) at a point the affected may or may not have touched. If they were to touch an enemy it would have no effect though. After the duration everything that they have touched turns back to normal as if it never died in the first place'Â¦ well because it didn't. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	3	4	Death: Grim Feeling	Oujou: Ikatsui Kibun	The user forms a series of handseals then touches both hands to the floor. if the opponent sees this action, he is trapped; Where the user touches his hands, a silhouette suddenly appears. Blood is everywhere around the silhouette, and it leads to the affected shinobi, most likely leading him to believe that that they have recently killed someone but they can't remember who, why, or even how. This jutsu can easily get on someone's nerves and force rash decisions. Durations: 1, 3, 5

984	4	1	War: Bloodlust	Kousen: Chigokai	A technique that causes the enemy to enter a state of savage behavior, activated by eye contact. The genjutsu fills the shinobi's mind with strange thoughts. It tells him that those around him are annoying little pests, they will just get in his way, or even that they are worthless. This genjutsu simply presents urges, it doesn't force the shinobi to actually talk out against his allies or strike them. Durations: 0, 2, 4														
984	4	2	Famine: Lack of Food	Kyoukou: Fusoku no Sesshoku	This technique is activated by the user saying, "I can't find anything to eat." If the opponent hears it, this technique is activated. This technique causes the enemy not only to feel a deep hunger but makes them think that all of the food in the world has gone rotten. They believe that all of the produce has wilted to dust and that all of the fruits have gone sour. They believe that all the livestock has been poisoned and that there is nothing left to eat. If used in combination with a hunger technique it could prove to be very useful. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	4	3	Plague: Itching Skin	Soeki: Kayui Gaihi	After a series of handseals, if the user manages to make some sort of skin-to-skin physical contact with his opponent, then this technique is activated. A very cynical technique that causes the enemy to feel a very deep and almost painful itch on their skin. This deep itch does not seem to go away no matter what the shinobi does it tries to lure the shinobi into scratching their skin so hard that they actually break their own skin. Unlike Chishio Kayumi no Jutsu (Blood Itch Technique) this technique is no where near as powerful. The shinobi usually only causes minor scratches and very small cuts on themselves. Durations: 1, 3, 5														
984	4	4	Death: Murder	Oujou: Satsujin	The user forms a series of handseals then touches both hands to the floor. if the opponent sees this action, he is trapped; Where the user touches his hands, a silhouette suddenly appears. The silhouette looks familiar -- like one of the target's close friends or relatives. A trail of blood follows from the silhouette to the opponent, likely tricking the opponent to believe that he himself killed the close friend / relative. The details supplied for the murder they have caused is very vague so it may or may not be believable. At the very least it can cause the target to feel very stressful or guilty.

984	5	1	War: Battlefield	Kousen: Senjou	This technique is activated by eye contact; when the eye contact breaks, the opponent is overwhelmed by the illusion. The entire area turns into a burning battlefield covered in corpses and injured soldiers from every country. Screams and cries fill the air and fights can be seen in every direction. This technique affects everyone within twenty yards including the user but not only does it trick the mind into seeing a different area. This technique often stirs up adrenaline in the watchers to the point that they wish to fight to kill. The smarter shinobi are able to discriminate between friend and foe, while some cannot. Durations: 0, 2, 4														
984	5	2	Famine: Skin and bones	Kyoukou: Gaihi soshite Kosshi	A word activated technique that requires the enemy shinobi to hear the speaker say 'You look a little thin.' Upon hearing this, if the shinobi in any way sees their own body '' this includes hands, legs, feet, chest, and many other parts, which basically makes very hard to avoid '' they see that their body is incredibly thin and frail looking. Their thin limbs begin to shake uncontrollably (not physically, but part of the illusion), at times making them want to fall to the ground. Durations: 0, 2, 4														
984	5	3	Plague: Purification	Soeki: Kiyome	Description :A very disgusting technique that convinces the enemy that they are very sick and have recently consumed something that could kill them. This technique is activated by the user making a loud gagging noise. If the opponent hears it, the technique is activated. This technique urges the shinobi to throw up and purge themselves in anyway possible. If a shinobi is forced to throw up three times in the same thread it will cause damage to the lining of the throat. Durations: 0, 1, 2														
984	5	4	Death: Foresight	Oujou: Yoken	A horrible genjutsu that can quite literally make one go insane. Activated by a series of handseals and simple eye contact, this genjutsu gives the target premonitions of their own death. They see clear and very vivid details of their own death and it shows that it will occur within an hour, in most cases it involves who they are fighting or a close friend in the vicinity.

984	6	1	War: Dying	Kousen: Fuki	Description:This technique is activated by the user dragging his index finger horizontally across his neck. (The 'you're-dead-meat' symbol, you could say.) A very painful genjutsu that gives the illusion that the target is laying motionless on the floor in middle of a bloody battlefield. Their body is covered in wounds and different sized cuts cover almost every inch of their body. They feel the pain as if it was real and it lingers even after the genjutsu dissipates. There is no evidence of any wounds on the target's body; all the pain he feels roots from the mind. The pain disappears definitely when then opponent examines his body and realizes that he is not physically harmed. Durations: 0, 2, 3														
984	6	2	Famine: Feast in Flesh and Blood	Kyoukou: Chisou in Namami	Possibly the most vile and downright wrong technique in this entire tree. Some would even consider this technique too disgusting to use. This Genjutsu is activated by the user forming a series of handseals then exposing the opponent to the smell of blood. If the opponent smells it, the technique is activated: it causes a hunger so dire and demanding that the opponent most likely do anything to sate it. The genjutsu user will fill their target's head with thoughts of actually eating others around them including their allies just to stop the hunger'Â¦ anything or anyway to get rid of such a killing pain would be good. Durations: 0, 2, 3														
984	6	3	Plague: Yellow Fever	Soeki: Koushoku Netsu	A very powerful genjutsu that copies the effects of the bacteria that produces the sickness known as yellow fever. While it emulates the effects of yellow fever all of this happens in the head of shinobi, they are not really sick. The normal yellow fever may take days to actually have any real effect but this genjutsu only takes a fraction of the time. Those unlucky enough to be hit with this genjutsu don't notice anything right away but within one post they start to sweat and ache. In two posts they feel as if they have a high fever and develop the urge to vomit. Within three posts the shinobi feels extremely fatigued. Upon the end of the jutsu the effects end and everything returns to normal. Durations: 0, 2, 3														
984	6	4	Death: Sacrifice	Oujou: Gisei	This technique often brings a person to the edge of their sanity. The shinobi using the genjutsu must first use a whole post to form hand seals and prepare the needed chakra before unleashing this technique. The opponent must've seen the user forming the seals. Once caught in this horrible genjutsu the target suddenly senses a change in the world around them, they cannot place this change though. The air seems thicker, the shadows deeper, the sky darker, and their emotions stronger. Slowly, one by one, a person that is close to the shinobi walks upon the area in which he was engaged in combat. Even if he screams for them, calls for them, or tries to warn them, they cannot hear him. They look past him, as if he is not there at all and they search for him. One by one though, they die, each one of them is extinguished in a horrible and gruesome way chosen specifically by the user of this technique. The shinobi cannot do anything but watch in horror as his family, teammates, and friends die. One illusion may be killed per post. Durations: 0, 2, 3

984	7	1	War: To Plant the Seeds of Hatred	Kousen: Shokubutsu Za-men no Gojou	Passionate hatreds can give meaning and purpose to an empty life. These people haunted by the purposelessness of their lives try to find a new content not only by dedicating themselves to a holy cause but also by nursing a fanatical grievance. A mass movement offers them unlimited opportunities for battle. This genjutsu is known to be activated by various methods, but the most common is verbal phrase or physical. The user of this jutsu selects a person within sight of both the victim and user. Once the person is pick the victim begins to be annoyed by the selected individual. It starts out as a mere annoyance, but as the person continues to act something about them begins to piss off the victim of the genjutsu more and more to the point that at the pinnacle of this jutsu the victim has the unstoppable urge to kill the selected individual. This jutsu does not affect blood related people or people who are truly in love, but all other individuals are free to be selected. Durations: 0, 2, 3														
984	7	2	To Feast on Ones Self	Kyoukou: Dzuki Chisou o Onore	They said they were anhungry; sighed forth proverbs-- That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds They vented their complainings, which being answered And a petition granted them, a strange one, To break the heart of generosity, And make bold power look pale, they threw their caps As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon, Shouting their emulation. Dzuki Chisou o Onore no Jutsu is another disgusting and almost taboo genjutsu. All those who have suffered to its wrath know what true fear is, they learn the true power of genjutsu. This Genjutsu is activated by the user forming a series of handseals then exposing the opponent to the smell of blood. If the opponent smells it, the technique is activated: The shinobi is again struck with such a powerful hunger that it almost drives them insane. No sane man without strict discipline could bear such a pain. Suddenly, an alluring smell drifts from the affected's own skin, one that smells of foods more delicious than they've ever tasted before. This technique has a good chance of driving the opponent to feast upon himself. This requires enemy permission or a death enabled thread. Durations: 0, 2, 3														
984	7	3	Plague: Black Death	Soeki: Kuro Oujou	As man, perhaps, the moment of his breath, Receives the lurking principle of death, The younger disease, that must subdue at length, Grows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength. The Black Death or bubonic plague has been feared for centuries and this technique takes that fear and emulates it into a genjutsu of its own class. The technique perfectly emulates the bubonic plague but also adds a few of its own touches. Do note this again, this is a trick on the eyes and body and no one actually has the disease. The victim must be touching the shinobi for this technique to take effect. Upon being touched the shinobi breaks out into vicious, illusionary, black welts called buboes. These welts cause severe pain when touched by anything. The welts last for a single post and explode into a disgusting well of puss and blood. Not only this, but another post they suddenly feel as if their stomach is rejecting whatever they ate. The shinobi can sit with the disgusting feeling or choose to force themselves to vomit to stop the gut withering feeling. Upon vomiting they actually release illusionary blood but in all honesty it is normal vomit. What makes this so much deadlier then the yellow fever technique is that it spreads. Any shinobi that comes within ten feet of an infected shinobi (Including the genjutsu user) is also infected with the same exact genjutsu. They too believe that they are infected as long as they were in the initial area when the genjutsu had been used. Durations: 0, 2, 3														
984	7	4	Death: The Peaceful Shadow that Clings	Oujou: Sono Yasui Kage are Koshou	Death, rock me asleep, Bring me to quiet rest, Let pass my weary guiltless ghost Out of my careful breast. Toll on, thou passing bell; Ring out my doleful knell; Let thy sound my death tell. Death doth draw nigh; There is no remedy. Despite being such a powerful technique and at the top tier of the death genjutsu, this tends to be a very peaceful technique. In some ways, it is almost a mercy compared to some of the more cynical techniques that plague this tree. The shinobi lays a single finger somewhere on the opponent, although the head would be recommended to activate this technique. Upon being a chill is sent up the opponent's spine warning them what has happened and they can actually see his shadow changing shapes. The shadow takes the shape of the grim reaper; it sits ominously behind them and tells them what is to come. In all honesty this technique does not and cannot kill someone but instead fills them with such fear and chaos that it can be to much for many shinobi to handle. While of course this isn't true for all shinobi, especially since each man is his own, it is still rather nerve racking. They believe that at the end of the genjutsu that something will come and kill them in a very gruesome manor. Upon the actual end of the genjutsu they see the shadow materialize into the real grim reaper but it simply dissipates. For obvious reasons this technique is only useful once per thread.

Quite simply put this technique simulates the power that is the apocalypse in the mind of those around him. The sky above erupts into flames and jets of fire roar as they arc across the sky. Liquids of all sort slowly begin to change color and texture, they grow thicker (Or thinner depending on what it is) and begin to evolve into a bloody red hue. In the distance a low humming sound works its way across the horizon and slowly grows louder until it becomes so overwhelming that the ear drums begin to bleed.And above, if one was to look, four galloping horses mounted by dark riders sprint across the sky as if it was solid ground. As they draw closer the elements begin to take over. Balls of raging scarlet flame fall from the heaven like corrupted angels and cause explosions so catastrophic that it rattles the planet itself. The source of the beating wings finally become visible as swarms and throngs of locust reveal themselves. They encircle victims and devour them alive, they leave nothing but bones. This technique is so torturous that even the corpses of the fallen illusions cannot rest, the skeletons and burning remains rise and stumbles towards the nearest sign of life. Cries of the dying fill the thick air; it seems that no one would be able to live through this.The ones caught within such a horrible genjutsu often lose their minds halfway through. This technique can affect up to three people at a time. Genin and chuunin stand no chance against such a powerful technique so by the end of this technique they are not the same person they used to be. Instead they are more of a empty husk, a shell of what once was. What remains now is simply madness, chaos... anarchy. A jounin with more willpower than half of the Sennin's willpower may be able to come through with their mind intact. This requires a death enabled thread or enemy permission.Durations: 0, 2, 4														
983	1	1	Desperate Measure Fist	Kyuusaku-Ken	At this point, not much is leaned in the way of interesting attacks. The user works on their punches, kicks, and getting the stances down(which amounts to being able to accurately gauge the distance between them and their foes). Fighting isn't much of an art at this level. In fact, it's basically just brawling.	4	3	2			4	4							
983	2	2	Desperate Measure Fist	Kyuusaku-Ken	Punches and Kicks are more refined, and the stances are considered to be mastered by this point. In addition, the user learns a few useful techniques.	4	3	2	Dust Blinding: One of the most basic of the basics, it amounts to stealthily scooping up a bit of dust, sand, or loose dirt, and tossing it into the opponent's eyes. It's best done after being knocked down, or forced into a crouch, where the dust scoop may go unnoticed, until it's too late. Most often utilized in the Middle Stance.Shin Kick: Let's face it, our shins are very sensitive, especially to hard kicks. If the kick is hard enough, it can even break bones. But mostly, it just causes painful bruises. Best used in the Close Stance, where seeing it coming is difficult.One Arm Shoulder Throw: Grabbing the arm of the opponent with one hand, the user places the other under their armpit, and turns their back towards the opponent. Using the hip, they lift and throw the opponent over their shoulder in one smooth motion. Best used in the Far Stance, as a counter to some types of punches, or in the other stances as a regular attack.Stacking The Odds: Fighting without making use of all your resources is foolish and wasteful. By maximizing your advantages, more battles are won. Taking on an opponent with a friend may not be sportsman-like, but it's a hell of a lot more safer than fighting on your own. Challenging an opponent to a fight in an area you've already rigged with traps is perfectly reasonable. And attacking before your opponent is ready is just plain common sense.	Hasai Dainamaito Akuto[Crushing Dynamite Heel]: Painful, humiliating, and oh so effective, the user must be in the Middle Stance. He begins and ends the technique with a powerful rising heel kick between the legs of the opponent. Less effective on females, but still quite painful.	8	6				6			
983	3	3	Desperate Measure Fist	Kyuusaku-Ken	The aim of this stage is to learn how best to disabling the opponent's lower body, usually through breaking bones. In addition, he learns a few more techniques:	4	3	2	Leg Break: Kicking an opponent above the waist is best left unused, but this technique deals not with kicking, but catching said kicks. Executed in Middle or Far Stances, the user simply catches the offending leg by the ankle with both hands. Shifting one hand farther up the leg(around the knee), he then brings his knee up and attempts to break the lower leg, effectively disabling all but the most hardcore opponents.Knee Crush: The knees are an important part of the leg, but so very fragile. There are so many ways to ruin them, too. The simplest is to crush it through sheer force. So the first way to ruin the knee is a drop kick to said joint, putting the full weight and force of the user behind the blow. The other way is to kick at the side of the knee from a standing position. While this requires a bit more effort, it is usually easier to pull off in a fight.Foot Smash: The feet are surprisingly often left alone in a fight, but once broken, they make things difficult for the opponent. In the Close Stance, the user simply stomps down on the innocent thing, usually after grabbing hold of some part of the opponent's body, to prevent missing. The weight and force of the blow will shatter the foot bones, making walking or even standing very troublesome.Painful Knee: The groin is a very interesting spot. So sensitive, and so easy to target. While in the Close Stance, the user brings the knee up to hit either between the legs or the front of the groin area. Quite painful.Resourceful Fighter: A good brawler can knock people around with his fists. A smart brawler will realize that using an object can greatly enhance the amount of damage caused by his strokes. Basic resourcefulness allows the fighter to quickly locate and utilize blunt objects as clubs. Chairs, branches, or even the occasional rock are just a few of the items used as both close and long range instruments of blunt trauma. It's none too graceful, but it usually gets the job done with less effort than just using your fists.	Sori Jiten Ryuusei [Arch Spin Meteor]: A difficult but effective throw, the user starts by crouching and using a sweeping kick to knock the foe off his feet. Reaching out with their hands, they grab one of the legs and fall back, swinging the foe overhead to slam into whatever is on the other side of themselves, such as a wall, tree, rock, or even just the ground. The tricky part is catching the leg after the sweep, but with practice the timing becomes second nature.	12	8				8			
983	4	4	Desperate Measure Fist	Kyuusaku-Ken	At this point, you'll want to concentrate on the arms and chest, but by now the punches and kicks should be perfected. Quick and powerful, they should be enough to give all but the toughest foe trouble.	4	3	2	Elbow Break: The elbows are the central joint of the arm, and if broken, things get much more difficult. Upon grabbing the opponent's arm, the user will twist the arm(if necessary) in order to get the elbow facing up. A sharp hand chop will follow, forcing the arm into an unnatural and very painful position, breaking the elbow. Normally starts in the Far Stance, and ends up with the user close enough to easily need a Close Stance change. Great for countering punches.Hand Seal Stop: Pesky Nin or Genjutsu users are always making those complex and delicate hand seals with their delicate hands. Simply put, the point is to prevent this from happening. A hard punch, or rarely even a kick, will usually be enough to break those poor fingers. Serves 'em right, damn it! Works best if the user is at least in the Middle Stance, though Close works better.Hand-Crushing Counter Elbow: The elbow is made of tougher stuff than the human hand, at least when it is used in blows. So while in the Far Stance, simply use an elbow thrust directly towards an incoming punch, and bear the brief pain while your foe has his hand break on him.Kidney Blow: Fairly simple and very painful, the user simply targets the opponent's lower kidney area, usually from behind, but also occasionally from the side. Because the lower kidney is not protected by the ribs, it can cause a great amount of pain to the target. Best used in the Close Stance.Guard Crash: At times there will be those who seek to block or parry your punches. This is a bad thing, but hopefully more so for the opponent. With luck and some good reflexes, open your fist and grab the defending limb. Use this for everything from keeping your opponent in one place, to turning it into a throw or simple hold.	Ketahazure Abara Houraku [Incredible Rib Collapse]: The chest contains some valuable equipment in it, and if you're lucky enough to break some of those precious ribs, it has a tendency to mess someone up, usually by causing internal bleeding or puncturing vital organs. In Close Stance, the user simply puts all of their strength into a single hard punch to the upper chest. The goal is to break the ribs, and if the opponent is female, this may be more difficult. If that's the case, you can still rest assured that they are in pain.	15	14	14			14			
983	5	5	Desperate Measure Fist	Kyuusaku-Ken		4	3	2	Throat Strike: The throat is the pathway that the air you need to breath flows through. Damaging this area will result in difficultly breathing, even to the point of suffocation. To perform this, a common way is to stiffen the hand into a 'knife' position, and thrust it at the front of the neck. Done correctly, it will bruise or even crush the windpipe. Can be used in either the Close or Middle Stances.Eye Poke: Eyes are good for seeing, so naturally, taking them out is a good idea in a fight. By extending to fingers, either in a V-shape or held together, the user pokes at one or even both eyes of the opponent. The effects are obvious, and common side-effects include blindness and severe pain. Used in the Close Stance.Nose Smash: The nose is a fragile part of the face, and a hard palm heel strike can easily break it, causing tearing and bleeding. In addition, if aimed at a certain upwards angle, it can even kill the opponent by pushing the bone into the brain. Should be used in either the Close or Middle Stance.Hair Grab: The hair of an opponent, in addition to sometimes helping them look better, is a useful leverage tool. Grabbing and pulling on hair is both painful and useful. It provides a good grip to immobilize the target for other attacks. Obviously, the target must have hair in order for this to work, and it gets easier the longer the hair is. Best used in the Close stance.Neck Launch Slam: A brutish move, it requires grabbing the opponent by the neck, and using it as a leverage point for a throw. In addition to the pain caused by the throw, it also causes strain to the neck. Difficult to pull off, the damage capability makes up for it. It does require good speed, making it ideal for the Far Stance.	Shiga Jikogisei Chien [Uncaring Self-Sacrifice Delay]: There are time when a blow most be taken for the greater good, i. e. victory. This technique delays the pain and shock of a blow for a total of two posts, during which time a counter-attack should be made. Charging through an attack without seeming to feel it can be very demoralizing, as well as useful. However, the full effects of the attack are felt after the delay. This technique can be used twice per thread.	20	19	17			16			
983	6	6	Desperate Measure Fist	Kyuusaku-Ken		4	3	2	Straight Knife Blow: By stiffening the hand into a knife-like shape, it's thrust with incredible strength at the abdomen section of the target. The force and narrow profile of the blow make piercing skin a definite possibility, and damage to the organs is a sure outcome.Bone Breaking: By striking a bone with enough force, it will break. Very simple in theory, this puts it into practice. Common targets are the arms and legs, but the ribs are also effective, as are the hands and feet. Executed in the Close Stance.Sternum Crush: The sternum of the body protects the most vital organs, and breaking this bone will often cause pieces of it to be embedded in those vital organs, and makes it next to impossible to breathe, and any breathing that IS accomplished is done with great pain. Using great strength, the user throws a straight palm heel thrust at the center of the chest, crushing the sternum with your incredible strength. Used only in the Close Stance, for the necessary strength.	Juubun Eda Hakai [Perfect Limb Destruction]: The user targets one limb of the opponent, then punches three times in the span of a second. This breaks the limb in three places, no more than two inches in-between each break point. In return, it breaks the user's hand, allowing it to be used a maximum of twice a thread. Used in the Middle Stance.	27	24	24	18		18			
983	7	7	Desperate Measure Fist	Kyuusaku-Ken	By this point, the user's imagination and knowledge of fighting is more than enough to improvise attacks of their own. If you wish, you may register a few normal attacks when taking this stage, but it is unnecessary.	4	3	2		Kyuukyoku Asshou Shiagekou [Ultimate Complete Victory Finisher]: An impressive sounding attack that delivers on it's name. If it connects, 80% of the time it will end the battle. In the Close Stance, the palm is thrust straight out into the chest, pushing the opponent out to arms length and likely breaking some ribs. Gripping the front of the clothing, the user follows with a blow to the throat, and finishes with a power-packed straight to the heart, crushing the organ with brutal strength. As it consists of merely a dangerous combination of blows, it can be used up to four times in a thread without breaking the fist on the bones of the target.	34	33	32	22		22			
982	1	1	Iron Fist	Gouken-Fu	This is the initial stage of learning where fundamentals and hard work are key. Any person practicing this style will from here on out begin to physically condition their body through all sorts of exercises. Rows of pushups, sit-ups, and miles of jogging are common amongst even Academy Students wishing to excel in this art. As per the teachings in this stage, Gouken emphasizes the geometric function of the straight line: it is the shortest and quickest path between two destinations. And when your fist is point A and your opponent's chest is point B, this can be the determining factor in any engagement.	3	3	3			4	4							
982	2	2	Iron Fist	Gouken-Fu	This stage of development serves to display the first onsets of might in any Gouken user. Still not especially powerful by most regards, the teachings of the first stage begin to take shape and form in the style. Fast and solid strikes become a staple here, though nothing outside the realm of average. Often, though, passerby's will find a young student practicing their art against the bark of a tree for hours on end, perfecting the art of striking fast and hard whilst also accustoming their hands or legs to the force.	3	3	3			7	7				6			
982	3	3	Iron Fist	Gouken-Fu	Here is where things begin to take a larger turn for the better in the art of Gouken. At this point the user is more aware of their strength and speed, able to determine their opponent's physical endurance simply through observation. After calculating this, they are then able to formulate a standard of battle in which they can either end a fight quickly through their now noteworthy speed, or they can reserve their attacks and simply delay an opponent's movements.	3	3	3			10	10				8			
982	4	4	Iron Fist	Gouken-Fu	The halfway point, this is where we separate the novices from the adept. The differences are distinct in this stage. Dash and leap attacks are a constant factor, mixed with punches and sweeps to create a fast-paced, hostile environment for any opponent. Strikes are now more than solid, easily capable of breaking bones in multiple points with ease and precision. This is owed mostly to the form and speed of such attacks, each now becoming more linear and direct. Nothing is more chilling than the bone-crunching thud accompanied by the attacks of a Gouken-user at this stage.	3	3	3			15	15	13			14			
982	5	5	Iron Fist	Gouken-Fu	Fluidity of attacks is seamless at this stage, the user tying in an ample of amount of kicks to punches in a variety of manners. What might start as a straight punch to the chest might switch to a low sweep to the legs followed by a straight heel to the chin while crouched from the ground. Fantastically aerobatic at this point, the user is able to move in ways that would otherwise cause too much strain on the body. Previously these movements might have been sparse, but here the user is most fit and comfortable with their body and makes routine out of them.	3	3	3			20	20	16			16			
982	6	6	Iron Fist	Gouken-Fu	Stage growth takes a certain leap at this point. Constant training and toning have developed most users of this style into superb fighting specimens. Their muscles are hard and lean, completely devoid of any imperfections. It is hard to imagine that any practitioner of Gouken is able to progress any farther in either style or body. But that is not the case at all.	3	3	3			27	28	20	16		20			
982	7	7	Iron Fist	Gouken-Fu	What else can be said except that this is the absolute zenith of Gouken-fu? True to the point, a practitioner at this Stage is completely self-aware of themselves and the immense destruction they are capable of sowing. Movement here is not stressed as much as previously, but only because from here on it normally only takes one precise blow to render an engagement ended.	3	3	3			35	36	28	20		24			
981	1	1	Perfect Balance	Kanbeki Kenkou	Balance: At this level of development, the user sees very little change in his physical ability. Above average balance allows the user to walk along narrow paths without much worry of falling, but when any outside influence tries to make him fall, he will go down just as easily as anyone else.Flexibility: There is no defining difference between the user and any other person. Natural flexibility is all he has.	3	3	3			3		5						
981	2	2	Perfect Balance	Kanbeki Kenkou	Balance: At this point, the user's balance is growing quickly. Handstands are a simple task, and the user can even fight on one foot if necessary. It is still possible to be knocked down, of course, but it is highly unlikely that the user will trip.Flexibility: While still not excellent, flexibility is growing in some areas. Currently, the user's most flexible area is the back. He is able to bend backwards without a problem, though getting back up again can be a bit of a challenge in mid battle.	3	3	3	Vertical KickDescription: With the level of flexibility growing, but the balance not quite at a sufficient level, the user attempts a dodge coupled with a counter offensive. By leaning backwards and kicking up his leg, the user unleashes a strong attack, catching himself with his hand to keep from falling.Wall VaultDescription: A very simple skill, really. When the user jumps up into the air, he positions himself in a way so that his feet will come into contact with a stable surface, then jumps off of it again with his full jumping height, but in any direction he should choose. This can only be done once per jump, so multiple launches are impossible.		8		6		6				
981	3	3	Perfect Balance	Kanbeki Kenkou	Balance: Even at this relatively early stage, the user shows proficiency in the aspect of balance. Now, the user is able to perform some difficult feats, and performing is not unthinkable. The limitations on the user still keep him within fairly normal limits, however.Flexibility: More flexibility is available in the back, now, allowing the user to twist more than ninety degrees at the waist, allowing him to turn around in mid-battle. Arms and legs are also getting the flexible effects, though it is not incredibly noticeable.	3	3	3	Feint Kick (Credit to Jped for this one)Description: The user swings his leg out at the opponent. At the last moment, the leg is bent slightly, just missing the opponent. With a quick reaction, the leg is brought back, smashing the heel into the opponent's side with full force. By using the first strike slightly differently, it can knock a weapon away, lowering defenses, but it makes the second strike more difficult to carry out.TwistDescription: As flexibility increases, the user becomes able to shift his body into more difficult positions. This technique has the user twist his upper body ninety degrees, making the surface area that can be hit by an attack much smaller.Wall ReboundDescription: Using the same principles as Wall Vault, the user twists his body about in the air to properly position himself, and then leaps off of a wall or other stable surface. However, with the increase in flexibility and control of the body, the user can reposition himself in midair several times to accomplish the Wall Vault several times. However, there must be a second surface to jump off of, either a perpendicular wall (meaning a corner, for instance), or a parallel wall (such as an alleyway). For every 5 points in stamina, the user can accomplish an additional Rebound beyond the first (this does not include bonuses).		9		11		8				
981	4	4	Perfect Balance	Kanbeki Kenkou	Balance: Normal limitations on balance are now being broken, to a small degree. The user becomes able to stand in very strange positions, such as leaning back at a 45 degree angle to the ground, without worry of falling. Getting back up from these positions is still a bit of work, though.Flexibility: In conjunction with the increased level of balance, the user's flexibility makes for a very strange person. Now the user is becoming on par with an amateur contortionist, able to mash his body into places others would find cramped. With the excellent balance, the user can stand in some very odd positions.	3	3	3	Radial AssaultDescription: Either from a run or a standstill, the user leaps forward slightly, rolling forward in the air. His legs extend to their full length, smashing down both upon the target in front of the user. As the spinning continues, his legs hit the ground, allowing both arms to attack as well while the feet catch the ground, returning the user to a slightly crouched position.Fall BackDescription: A very simple technique in execution. The user simply leans backwards a great deal, keeping his feet firmly on the ground and using his ankles to lean at a 45 degree angle to the ground. By itself, the technique can only evade attacks aimed at the upper body. After being back for the moment, the user leans back up to a standing position. Usually, the user can go about two feet backwards with his head, and the distance tapers off as attacks are aimed lower.Air VaultDescription: Identical in execution to the Wall Vault, this skill has only one major difference. While Wall Vault requires a stable surface, Air Vault does not. Using the now excellent physical control of the style, the user is able to jump from anything, as long as it is roughly the same weight as the user. If, for instance, the user jumped into the air and used another person for a surface, that other person's trajectory would not be affected at all, while the user could jump fully in whatever direction desired. This can only be used once in a jump and can't be combined with the other Vaults.		17	14	12		14				
981	5	5	Perfect Balance	Kanbeki Kenkou	Balance: This is the point in the style where any limbo practitioner would become jealous to no end. Balance is so efficient now that the user can bend at the knees, his back becoming parallel to the ground, and remain in that position with ease, even walking forward. Speed is reduced, of course, but it is still impressive.Flexibility: Just as balance has reached an incredible level, so has flexibility. Now the user is a full-blown contortionist, nearly able to wrap his body around itself, fitting it into small crates and places. With both balance and flexibility at such levels, the user would be considered quite the freak among other taijutsu practitioners.	3	3	3	Gyro AssaultDescription: A more advanced version of Radial Assault, Gyro Assault adds a third dimension to the attack, as well as several more strikes. The spin is lateral, now, but done at a slight angle. The user runs up and leaps into the air, spinning and attacking with one arm and leg first, followed by the other arm and leg. After the two sets of strikes, the user's body twists, changing the angle he is spinning at by ninety degrees, and following up with a second attack, the mirror of the first.LimboDescription: A technique that mimics a limbo dancer in the way it is used, but its purpose is quite different. Bending at the knees, the user leans backwards until his body becomes parallel to the ground. This allows him to dodge any attacks aimed above the knees.Wall ClimbDescription: Another advancement to the Wall Vault, though much more practical than Wall Rebound. Multiple jumps are possible along a single wall, the user simply rising vertically with each and every jump. For every 10 points of Stamina, he can perform another jump without touching the ground. The number of additional jumps per post is determined by the person using it, and must be agreed upon by the other member(s) of the thread.		22	16	18		16				
981	6	6	Perfect Balance	Kanbeki Kenkou	Balance: There is very little change from the previous level of balance. Knocking the user down is nearly impossible; reflex and sense of balance make quick recoveries a simple task. Impossible positions are elementary for the user, such as balancing on a single finger and even "walking" on a pair of fingers. This does not mean, of course, that the user cannot be knocked down. Extreme circumstances can do so.Flexibility: The user is becoming almost serpentine, now. An odd stealth method involves the user lying on the ground and slithering like a snake, using bodily strength to propel across the ground. Flexibility is also going far beyond what even the most perfectly double-jointed person would be able to do, allowing limbs to bend in reverse if necessary, though this cannot be done too often (twice a thread).	3	3	3	Omni KickDescription: Utilizing the amount of speed the user has obtained through massive training, he becomes able to release a flurry of kicks in a short instance. Flexibility plays a big part in this attack, as the leg is whipped around to attack so much. Each kick is fired straight out at the opponent. The number of kicks is equal to the user's speed + strength divided by ten, and this technique can be used a number of times equal to the user's stamina divided by ten per thread.FloaterDescription: A very similar technique to Limbo, floater goes one step further. The position for limbo is assumed instantly, and then the user propels himself backwards by kicking off from the ground. His entire body becomes parallel to the ground, making it nearly impossible to strike him.Feather StepDescription: The abilities of the Air Vault are enhanced remarkably with the user's incredible control of his body. Air Vault required the user to jump from something of equal mass, but Feather Step does not have such a requirement. With such great knowledge and control of his body, the user can leap off of anything that is a mere fraction of his mass. Anything less than half of his mass will be pushed back by the force of the leap, but the user will still be able to jump with his full ability. For this technique to be used, the object must be solid and at least the size of a shuriken. Again, this cannot be used in conjunction with the other jumping techniques. Also, this can only be used once a jump.SlitherDescription: Lying on the ground, the user pushes with his abdomen to move at full speed. This technique is used most often for stealth, as it is very difficult to see the user sliding along smoothly. However, the drawback is that the user is in a very vulnerable position while moving along.		25	20	30		19	17			
981	7	7	Perfect Balance	Kanbeki Kenkou	Balance: No change.Flexibility: Joints are no matter to the user anymore, as he can bend his body past their limits with ease, allowing him to assume horrendous positions and even invent new, nontraditional methods of fighting. However, due to the extreme nature of these contortions, this can only be used once a thread.	3	3	3		UnhingeDescription: A disgusting technique, as far as most are concerned. The user unhinges all of his joints throughout the body, causing massive pain for an instant. Afterwards, he becomes mass of scarcely-connected bones and skin, giving him ultimate flexibility, surpassing all previous levels. This dislocated form lasts for 3 posts.Sky StepDescription: This is the most incredible technique the user is able to attain within the style. Feather Step allowed him to leap from a small object, but Sky Step allows him to leap from nothing but air. Because of the utter complexity of the technique, it can only be used once per jump.	33	33	33		22	22			
980	1	1	Drunken Fist	Suiken	After taking some alcohol and getting drunk (or faking it) the user begins to sway back and forth, his voice slurs, and he is prone to fainting and collapsing at irregular intervals. The user's speed and reflexes increases dramatically and the user can attack from positions not regular to normal taijutsu users.	3	5	1	Li Tie Kuai He is a lame and disfigured beggar who, in his drunken stupor, takes off his tattered shoes and hangs on to his crutch for support. Li employs a two-handed grabbing technique, called lo kiu, which is aimed at pressure points on his opponent's arm. The technique can numb the skin. Strong squeezing of the limbs is acquired, and the movements are usually thrusting of arms forwards, messily, drunkenly grabbing onto the opponents limbs, rubbing them.Han Xiang Ci Although too drunk to stand, he can still play a lively tune on his flute and can make flowers bloom instantly. He is a scholar and is the patron saint of musicians. He uses a solid-fighting technique that dislocates joints. The user thrust body forward to the opponent, and if they were to wound someones joints in their elbow, they would put their dominant forearm on the opponents inside forearm, and resting the other forarm on their elbow, crushing the opponent arm. This style is used for all limbs.		3	5

Li employs a two-handed grabbing technique, called lo kiu, which is aimed at pressure points on his opponent's arm. The technique can numb the skin, and at this level, they can probably dreak minor bones to the opponent at full power. Takes a lot of strength out of the arms, though.Han Xiang Ci (Level Two)Although too drunk to stand, he can still play a lively tune on his flute and can make flowers bloom instantly.

Han's fighting techniques are ground-fighting movements because he is too drunk to stand upright. He pulls his opponent toward him with both hands while simultaneously delivering a powerful low kick to his enemy's knee or groin. The users stance is obviously crouching extremely low to the ground, and when the user moves, they roll on the ground kicking the opponent. In this upgrade, rolls become much faster, style becomes more fluid and confusing, kicks are stronger, and at this level, swinging-down punches are used as well, to have better combos.Li Tie Kuai (Level Three)He is a lame and disfigured beggar who, in his drunken stupor, takes off his tattered shoes and hangs on to his crutch for support. Li employs a two-handed grabbing technique, called lo kiu, which is aimed at pressure points on his opponent's arm. The technique can numb the skin or break bones, if the user has practiced it enough. Strong squeezing of the limbs is acquired, and the movements are usually thrusting of arms forwards, messily, drunkenly grabbing onto the opponents limbs, rubbing them. At this stage, one clean blow is almost certain to bring excruciating pain to the enemy, tearing flesh off, and bone breaking can be common in a clean attack at this level.Chang Kuo Lao An old man who rides a donkey, Chang is so drunk that he's riding it backwards and is holding onto the animal's tail to keep from falling off.

He pulls his opponent toward him with both hands while simultaneously delivering a powerful low kick to his enemy's knee or groin. The users stance is obviously crouching extremely low to the ground, and when the user moves, they roll on the ground kicking the opponent. At this level, clean kicks can knock the opponent out completely, if directed at the groin, and can immobilize the legs in kciks there. The fist techniques can cause quite harsh damage as well,a nd all of the techniques are much stronger than before. Rolling is much faster.Chang Kuo Lao (Level Two)An old man who rides a donkey, Chang is so drunk that he's riding it backwards and is holding onto the animal's tail to keep from falling off.

However, she wants nothing to do with his frivolous brother, because all he can do is hold his wine cup and stare at the moon. The drunken practitioner's hip presses against and immobilizes his opposition, then the user will step and spin around the opponent, hitting various pressure points around the body and ending in a double kick to the back, knocking them down to the ground. A great combo, used many times, and can cause harsh inner body damages to the opponent.		13	18	12			14			
980	5	5	Drunken Fist	Suiken	After taking some alcohol and getting drunk (or faking it) the user begins to sway back and forth, his voice slurs, and he is prone to fainting and collapsing at irregular intervals. The user's speed and reflexes increases dramatically and the user can attack from positions not regular to normal taijutsu users.	3	5	1	Lu Tong Pin A drunken Taoist priest and scholar who carries a sword with which to overcome evil, his technique is deceptive and hard to follow. It often weaves and ends with a powerful sword-finger strike at lethal pressure points in the body, often in the neck area where little protection can take place. Strikes resemble the Hyuuga's 64-hand strike, but instead of hitting at the chakra holes, it hits at various pressure points continually, and in a much more drunken fashion. Movements are always unpredicatable.Chang Kuo Lao (Level Three)An old man who rides a donkey, Chang is so drunk that he's riding it backwards and is holding onto the animal's tail to keep from falling off. His technique bends and breaks opponent's fingers. The user bends backwards and continuously strikes the abdomen area with 'cup hands.' Totally in use of Paiken, it's continuous strikes there, rolling off completely. At this level, massive damage can be cause to the abdomen, causing extreme loss of breath one a good combination in the style has occurred. EVerything else is improved as well.Lan Zai Hou Lan is a very drunk young boy who carries a flower basket in one hand and a wine cup in the other. This seemingly innocent youth actually turns his flower basket hand into a paralyzing grabbing hand, and transforms his drinking hand into a devastating eye strike that will temporarily blind the opponent.

The user's speed and reflexes increases dramatically and the user can attack from positions not regular to normal taijutsu users.	3	5	1	Lu Tong Pin (Level Two)A drunken Taoist priest and scholar who carries a sword with which to overcome evil, his technique is deceptive and hard to follow. It often weaves and ends with a powerful sword-finger strike at lethal pressure points in the body, often in the neck area where little protection can take place. Strikes resemble the Hyuuga's 64-hand strike, but instead of hitting at the chakra holes, it hits at various pressure points continually, and in a much more drunken fashion. Movements are always unpredicatable. In this upgrade, strikes are much more efficient and strong, causing twice the damage. Aim is a lot better, as well.Lan Zai Hou (Level Two) Lan is a very drunk young boy who carries a flower basket in one hand and a wine cup in the other.

979	1	1	Flawed Fist	Kizuken	At the most basic level, the user has basically no readily available form or style to depend on other than being a bit faster than other genin.		5	4				5	3						
979	2	2	Flawed Fist	Kizuken	Power - The severity and form of the user's blows in this level are quite basic. Not able to do much else rather than cause bruises and such unto an opponent, this is the true starting point of the styleAgility ' Since Kizuken users don't rely on power, they had to develop bodies fitting acrobats, thus working more on speed and agility. Fluidity in the movements is quite pronounced, differing slightly from other linear styles. Dodging is made much easier with the increased elasticity of the body, which is however not as supple as the user would want it to be. The user is able to leap about head level at his level.		5	4				8	6			6			
979	3	3	Flawed Fist	Kizuken	Agility ' At this stage, the fluidity in the movements is even more noticeable, allowing the user to bend make his body take positions which would be quite uncomfortable for the average Gouken user. Dodging ease is brought to another level now that the user's body is extremely flexible and supple.		5	4				12	8			8			
979	4	4	Flawed Fist	Kizuken	Agility ' At this stage, the fluidity in the movements is almost perfect, the user becoming quite unpredictable, although not up to the level of a drunken boxer. Suppleness doesn't change much from the previous level, but the user learns how to use those fluid movements even while he is in mid flight, thus allowing him to dodge projectiles and punches while he is supposed to be '˜defenseless'. He is also able to jump higher than before'¦		5	4			13	17	13			14			
979	5	5	Flawed Fist	Kizuken	Agility ' At this stage, the fluidity has more a sense of purpose. The user knows exactly where he wants his body to go, moving like water. While the style is close to perfection, it hasn't quite got there yet.		5	4			16	22	18			16			
979	6	6	Flawed Fist	Kizuken	Agility ' Fluidity can now be considered as perfect, the user doing the strict minimum in his actions so as to waste the least amount of energy as possible. At the same time, he keeps his unpredictability by virtue of his ability to shape his elastic body like a contortionist, able to take the most unthinkable positions. Spinning around oneself while jumping in the way of a dancer or acrobat, the user, although possessing extremely supple muscles, is still bound by the limits his joints place on him.		5	4			21	30	24	14		22			
979	7	7	Flawed Fist	Kizuken	Agility ' Extremely agile, supple and flexible, the user's body is now perfectly conditioned so that it allows the user to shape his body beyond the possibilities of a regular corporeal frame. Almost seeming as if he were boneless, the adept appears to dance through the most linear, predictable and repetitive attacks, dodging them skilfully using his body's elasticity. Massive leaps are now within the skill scope of the user.	4	1	4			24	39	33	20		27			
978	1	1	Fierce God Fist	Sa Kishin Kobushi	Slow punches that hurt if they land and amazingly the child has a cast iron jaw. Well when it comes to facing other children of course, other peers find it difficult to withstand the oppressive power this taijutsu gives its owners. At this stage though there is nothing else truly spectacular.	5		4	Name: Kurogane Sokudan (Iron Snap Judgment)Description: What is referred to as the one inch palm strike has a different use here. The user no matter how close he is to the opponent is able to move and strike with the full force of a punch as if he or she had the perfect distance. This is obtained with the correct twisting and forge generated with weight.		4		4						
978	2	2	Fierce God Fist	Sa Kishin Kobushi	The genin now has become quite the force to be reckoned with. They have already become immensely strong for their age and can withstand quite a bit of damage. Though they are still novices they can be topped with the right strategy. The genin continue to develop their now growing bodies and mastering all ranges of movement allowed.	5		4	Name: Rixyu-ju Dangan (Sledge Shot)Description: At first maximized movement only went from in front of the user. He or she was able to generate the appropriate force from short distances. Now with Rixyu-ju Dangan that principle branches out to include downward attacks. This though works best if the user is much taller than their enemy but it otherwise is effective. The user swings his arms back and than drive them upward and downward. This is an impressive powers hot accompanied by the force generated from a 180 degree turn.		7		7		6				
978	3	3	Fierce God Fist	Sa Kishin Kobushi	There have been mentions of some genin who have progressed so deeply into a taijutsu at an early age that they are able to dominate the field against even some experienced enemies. At this point the genin has grown to the very limit of his potential at this tender age. His muscles and body can generate enough power to break boards with ease and their body is build to withstand pain and punishment.	5		4	Name: Kishin Enchou (Fierce God Extension)Description: The arms have a certain reach all around them, in every single twisting angle. The strength this taijutsu has become known for can be fully used from any direction in front or to the side of the user. If for example the user was surrounded by 3 enemies all within range he or she will be able to strike all of them down with their pull strength.	Name: Kishin Ago (Fierce God Jaw)Requirement: Strength 8, Stamina 8, Speed 6Description: The very first defensive ability within a slew of more. The first and most typical place to attack someone is the face and jaw, so delicate and accompanied by many other delicate things. With the use of chakra the user can tighten his or her jaw and neck to the point where most attacks do not hurt, hell 9 times out of 10 the attack will be mostly ignored, typically it would feel like a regular blow. If used on time: hand to and blunt weapon taijutsu across the face can be endured with little or almost no flinching. If the stamina of the user surpasses the enemies strength this defensive move is successful.If the enemy's strength surpasses the users control + Â½ stamina (no tai bonus) this technique is not performed correctly and the user takes extensive damage that can easily cause the jaw to break.Name: Kishin Sentou (Fierce God Punch)Description: With the abundant strength developed within the body of the genin, he or she is now able to push themselves beyond their limits. The body is able to withstand the force generated by their powerful special attacks. What starts off as a simple punch changes with a simple addition. As the punch is heading toward the enemy the practitioner releases a jet of chakra from the elbow to add to the strength of the user not only increasing the punches speed but power as well.	10		10		8				
978	4	4	Fierce God Fist	Sa Kishin Kobushi	The chuunin has learned much about their abilities and is introduced to a new aspect of the style known as Tentouitten or Heaven Point. (this was used in the Kishin Sentou special technique) These are specific spots along the body were movement is key for attacks. It is at these points that become an additional study for the student of Sa Kinshin Kobushi. All of the other classics remain; the intense physical training - which only deepened as the body needs more muscle to withstand the higher grades of power generated-, the mastery of movement and the ability to endure.	5		4	Name: Karada Buki (Body Weapon)Description: An enhancement of the Kishin Enchou (Fierce God Extension) where only the arms were able to be used with the body's full strength. Now the entire torso including elbows and the head can be used with this amazing abundant force.	Name: Kishin Chikaraashi (Fierce God's Strong Legs)Requirement: Strength 12, Stamina 11, Speed 10, Willpower 12Description: The users of this style are slow but efficient. They are unable to catch up to enemies quickly and need to calculate movements carefully to pin enemies so if you wish to create distance one would target and weaken the legs. Well to bad that plan has now gone down the toilet. This forcibly tightens the leg muscles in order to defend against an incoming taijutsu or blunt weapon attack. Sharp or bladed weapons cut through this technique and deal damage to the user as normal.Strikes that could normally cause knees to buckle, ankles to break and toes to shatter will be endured. The amount of damage is lessened to the point where it looks as if nothing has happened. Though the user of the jutsu will feel pain but it is something they will be able to endure with some ease.If the enemy's strength surpasses the users control + Â½ stamina (no tai bonus) this technique is not performed correctly and the user takes extensive damage that can cripple him or her.Name: Kinshin Assai Nigiri (Fierce God's Crushing Grip)Requirement: Willpower 12, Tactics 11, Intelligence 10, Strength 12Description: The first Tensouitten learned are those on the joints and knuckles of the hands. When the user grabs the enemy in any point this special move can be unleashed, a sudden pushing of chakra from the finger joints causes the hand to suddenly squeeze. That plus the strength of the user can lead to an attack that can quite possibly crush a human jaw, wrist or ankle in a snap.	17	10	16		14				
978	5	5	Fierce God Fist	Sa Kishin Kobushi	The training has been grueling, the patience has been tested and the spirit refined and now it shows the years of paid off with the discovery of ones Tenshouitten the user has become a one man gang. Able to protect and withstand blows from many different enemies and able to in only a mere instant deliver pain. Of course there is still much to develop the strain of the body has not lessened in the slightest and now the user has become proficient to the point where he or she is able to kick. Of course the proficiency with said kick is not wonderful but it is better than nothing.	5		4	Name: Wareru Tsuchi (To Cleave Earth)Description: Calling this a devastating kick would be insulting its freakish strength. This may look like a simple roundhouse to the mid-section but with the trained control of a Sa Kishin Kobushi specialist turns this simple move into an attack that can cause internal damage. With all of the twisting and all of that extra force this generates a kick that can break a rock in two.	Name: Kinshin Karada (Fierce God Body)Requirement: Strength 17, Stamina 16, Speed 16, Willpower 15Description: So at this point the head and the legs are out of reach from damage. What is left but the torso yes? Uh no! You have just hit a wrong area once again. This uses the Tenshouitten across the stomach area to tighten and protect the stomach and all of the weak organs hidden inside of it.Blunt weapons and hand to hand trauma become somewhat useless. The body still endures shock and there will be bruising but overall in comparison to what could have happened this would be cake.If the strength of the user surpasses the control + 2/3rd stamina of the user this defense is useless. The damage dealt will rip all of the stomach muscles apart.Name: Kinshin Senshi (Fierce God Stab)Requirement: Strength 18, Stamina 17, Willpower 17, Tactics 14Description: Even though it is not an attack with a weapon getting hit by this attack sure as hell feel like it does. This is a driving knee aided by tenshouitten; the hips and ankles mostly. Both of them push the knee at the same time with the user and almost stab the user's knee into the enemy. This can rupture organs if the enemy is weak enough.	20	16	20		16				
978	6	6	Fierce God Fist	Sa Kishin Kobushi	The now master has nearly reached the pinnacle of skill. The body is an engine of destruction, pain and sheer oppressive power. There is one final step that must be learned and that is using this power and matching it with some sort of speed to form a combination. So far all of the attacks have been single powerful strikes that can level opponents. But for those who are resilient being able to take multiple strikes will be a problem. This stage of mastery has given the master simple yet extremely effective combo abilities.	5		4	Name: Nigenteki Kire (Dual Cut)Description: A pair of powerful uppercuts some toward the enemy. The user steps into the enemy and uppercuts the liver and as the face falls downward a teeth breaking uppercut lands on the jaw and	Name: Kishin Ushiro (Fierce God's Back)Requirement: Strength 21, Stamina 20, Speed 19, Willpower 17, Tactics 15Description: Now at this point these darn defenses have become quite difficult to penetrate the defenses of the Sa Kishin Kobushi master but maybe the back will reveal a weak spot? Once again it is unfortunate that the master has now learned how to properly manipulate his tensouitten to force his muscles to tightly close and defend against physical and blunt attacks.What could shatter ones spine, rupture kidneys or break off your tail bone will no longer do such damage. Instead the attack feels more like a good swift hit with a kendo stick.If the strength of the enemy surpasses the control and 2/3rd stamina of the user, the user will suffer extremely and have some ripped back muscles leaving the master unable to turn side to side.Name: Kishin Hagane Kobushi (Fierce God's Steel Fist)Requirement: Willpower 21, Tactics 20, Intelligence 19, Strength 17, Stamina 15Description: The user winds up and prepare him mentally for a punch that will not only devastate the user but if not done properly devastate him as well. The user turns around and leans back and then turns forward. The user expels chakra from tenshouitten all around him to quickly turn himself toward his enemy once again and pushes more out to even push him or herself forward to the enemy to ensure one hell of a punch.Name: Kishin Haraguroi Eidan (Fierce Gods Malicious Decisive Judgment)Requirement: Willpower 23, Tactics 23, Intelligence 22, Stamina 16, Speed 15Description: A deadly move that if used properly can be fatal to the enemy. It starts with a low wide 3/4s uppercut which once it is in motion is pushed upward faster by tensouitten across the arm. Then an overhand punch comes downward once again aided by tenshouitten to crush the face in between both of the user's hands. This force is so intense that it has been known to not only break jaws but shatter teeth and even cause eye problems.	27	23	25		20	16			
978	7	7	Fierce God Fist	Sa Kishin Kobushi	Complete perfection, there is nothing left for the master to learn at this point. The punches are filled with destructive power, the body a near endless stance against enemies. Those who have dared to stand in the way of this style will learn that only death and pain will come to them.What do you need regular techniques for anyway? You are like a god dude... or dudette.	5		4		Name: Shinsei Kishin Karada (True Fierce God Body)Requirement: Strength 30, Stamina 27, Speed 26, Willpower 22, Tactics 20Description: This is the ultimate physical defense for the grand master. Instead of only various parts being protected this tightens the entire body into a steel-like mass of muscle. Bladed weapons still penetrate and cut the flesh easily but hand to hand or blunt weapon attacks are almost useless against this.If the user has a strength higher than the control and stamina of the user this defense is useless and will cause the entire body to collapse under its own pressure and rip itself apart. The taijutsu master will only be able to operate at half his strength. (All tai styles cut to level 4. Speed down to 20 max including speed bonus. Stamina is also a 20, Strength stays at 30.)Name: Shinsei Kishin Yama Setsudanki (True Fierce God Mountain Cutter)Requirement: Willpower 30, Tactics 27, Intelligence 26, Strength 22, Stamina 20Description: The user first jumps upward using his own strength and tenshouitten along the feet to propel himself as high as he can. After such a high jump the master plummets downward once again using tenshouitten to increase his decent and deliver a karate chop that can not only possibly sever a human being in half due to all of the power but maybe even a mountain as well.Name: Shinsei Kishin Amatsu Hantei (True Fierce God Heavenly Judgement)Requirement: Strength 35, Stamina 33, Speed 31, Willpower 26, Intelligence 18 (Enemy permission required)Description: This final attack gathers every single lesson taught to the master up to this point. Every single tenshoitten, every movement, every inch of the users body. Though anyone who gets caught in such a technique is most likely going to be dead right after so it is suggested to run or do something.This combo starts off by using every tenshouitten across the back of the user (legs included) to quickly charge and slam their shoulder into the enemy. Once at this range the combo goes through these different attacks and they all show true mastery.The first part of the combo starts with rolling punches, the user rolls and weaves and starts to viciously punch their opponent. As this move continues the speed they gather begins to blur out their movements and every shot obviously feels worse then the last. After the last hit the user spins himself and now starts to use back fists instead of straight punches.After a suitable amount of back fists now kicks come in, specifically roundhouse kicks to the body and face. They come haphazardly toward the opponent so attempting to block them is extremely difficult though it is suggested that one does something at this point.The kicks lead to the master jumping on the shoulders of the enemy and front kicking their face at this short range in order to force their head back for the final piece of the attack. The master will stomp the opponent's face all the way into the ground and when there is only one more stomp left the final strike is prepared.The master hops upward and prepares to use both his or her feet to stomp the enemy in the face. The master stretches their arms out like a set of wings and push chakra from their back as they stomp down the enemy. This final strike smashes the enemy through the ground and if they were not in a coma yet, all bets were now off.It is said this combo reaches up to 101 hits but that is all myth. Regardless of that fact this final attack will most likely be the end of many an enemy.	37	29	33		24	20			
977	1	1	Phoenix Dance	Fushichou Buyou	Blocks - These are pretty basic defensive blocks, using the forearm and the legs to block obvious attacks. The blocks are pretty rough and not very graceful at this point in time, and are mostly to relocate where damage is done on the body rather than absorbing it effectively.Kicks - The kicks here are meant to be defensive, to lengthen the distance between attacker and the user. The kicks are basic, fairly slow and not solid.Jumps - The jumps here allow the user to avoid some ground attacks. They get down fairly fast and do not glide. The speed of the lift from the ground can be slow, since the user cannot yet calculate how much pressure they need to appropriately lift themselves up from the ground.Sweeps - Basically, an attack using the legs to knock the enemy off-balance. The sweep requires some speed to it and agility to time the opponent's attack. The aesthetic value of this is rough, not graceful, a purpose-oriented move.Dodge - Allows the user to bend his body forward, backwards and sideways to avoid attacks. This also allows spins. However at this stage, these are just basics and are not too graceful like the other basic stances. The user is still better off blocking in tight situations.	3	5	1			3	5							
977	2	2	Phoenix Dance	Fushichou Buyou	Blocks - Blocks at this level have achieved some grace, the elegance of the dancer playing an integral role. The block can take the enemy's force and with a twist of the wrist, shift his momentum and toss him over the user's shoulder. However, at this stage it requires some preparation, so is ill-used as a surprise attack on an opponent.Kicks - At this level, the kicks are more nimble, being swifter and more graceful. Jumps - The jumps at this level have achieved a sense of accuracy in the amount of power and pressure needed. Coming down is slower as the user is beginning to train on landing.Sweeps - The speed and timing of the sweep is now better and faster. The opponent may now be knocked off his feet completely, not an often occurrence but a possibility.Dodge - The user is now trained to be more flexible and faster. He is now more accurate in timing most attacks and can bend his body further. There is a certain level of grace achieved now, and so it looks more elaborate.	3	5	1			6	8				6			
977	3	3	Phoenix Dance	Fushichou Buyou	Blocks - Blocks at this level achieve a level of grace that can now be adapted to the rhythm of the person's dance. While tossing an enemy is still not a very effective technique, the user has learned to glance off the force from blows so that they are not receiving the full brunt of the attack.Kicks - The kicks are more fluid and faster, and this time they could add some spinning kicks that keep in time to the rhythm and with much power that can injure internally. Jumps - The jumps are high and graceful and look effortless, lifting the user up and allowing him to glide down or spin in the air with grace if desired. Though, because of the energy required, this is taxing to perform more than a few times in a fight.Sweeps - The sweeps are more elaborate and fast. It seems like the timing of the sweep is more accurate and the user can use and add hand movement to emphasize the dance. The sweep is now more like a spin, the user can now spin on the hands while knocking the opponent off-balance.Dodges - Though the movement itself is faster, the degree to which the user can flex his spine is still about a 50 degree angle from upright.	3	5	1			8	12				8			
977	4	4	Phoenix Dance	Fushichou Buyou	Blocks - It is difficult to force the blocker back more than a few feet from a normal punch or kick. Additionally, the user is beginning to learn how to decrease damage down by blades, accepting the attack if needed in a matter than does not pierce a major blood vessel or tear away a chunk of flesh. The dance is now more artful, with a personal rhythm that follows the user's heart beat or clanging of blades or patter of feet.Kicks - Kicks are now powerful yet, seem soft. It can now disguise itself of being a 'false move', a feint that tricks the enemy into countering too soon by a twitch of the leg that looks like a kick. The kicks can now combine with jumps, sweeps and spins, making this dance look like a ballet.Jumps - Jumps here are called 'The Flight of the Crane' just because of the sheer height and gliding of the jumps that makes it seem that the person is indeed flying. The flight can be accompanied by kicks, spins and blocks immediately upon landing, but are again, taxing on the user to perform often.Sweeps - The user begins to mix head-aiming kicks with sweeps. This makes the style slightly more unpredictable by crouching down and supporting one's body with the hands, and then raising the feet from the ground to kick upwards at the opponent's head region. Normal sweeps also begin with crouching down, so the enemy may be uncertain what the dancer is planning to do.Dodges - Dodges are impressive; the user can now even launch a jump from dodge position. The nimbleness and agility of the person gives an extra edge to this move.	3	5	1			14	17	12			14			
977	5	5	Phoenix Dance	Fushichou Buyou	Blocks - Quick, powerful blocks that aim to throw off the opponent's rhythm. While actual prowess with this move has not improved, the user has reached a point where grabbing and tossing an opponent comes easier, and it is harder for the enemy to anticipate such a tactic.Kicks - The kicks here begin deliberately, then snap with a quick, powerful motion that aims to knock down the enemy. Jumps - The jumps are high, involving spins to dodge in the air if necessary. At this level the user also starts implementing distance-covering jumps to surprise the enemy, getting in close from a longer range for a quick strike, then retreating. Horizontal jumps are less tiring than vertical jumps, but still demand much of the dancer's stamina.Sweeps - The sweeps look like a blur, so fast are they and so well-executed that the user can often return to a standing position just by force of momentum alone. Dodges - The dodges at this stage are such that the user can bend practically at a 90 degree angle if needed.	3	5	1			18	22	16			16			
977	6	6	Phoenix Dance	Fushichou Buyou	Blocks - This level makes blocks swift, fast and solid. By adjusting body position while being attacked by either blunt force or a sharp weapon, the user is able to minimize damage done by turning the attacks into blows that merely brush off the body, leaving shallower bruises and cuts than usual. Tosses are performed with more force from the user, though at the same speed.Kicks - Often described as 'hot and fast', the kicks are aimed high and done in quick succession, seeking to knock down the enemy as sweeps do from a lower angle. Jumps - Jumps are quick to launch both horizontally and vertically. As always, they are tiring for the dancer, but with graceful gliding movements reminiscent of a bird's rather than a warrior's, are well worth the frustration it causes the enemy. Even while in midair, the user is able to release a kick should the opponent attack.Sweeps - The sweeps are swift and ferocious; the most famous move is ground-level spin relying on leg strength that makes it almost impossible to make out from where and when the sweep will occur.Dodges - Users here commonly turn a dodge motion into a counterattack, falling over at the waist and then supporting themselves with hands against the ground as their feet snap up to catch the opponent in the face.	3	5	1			25	29	21		17	19			
977	7	7	Phoenix Dance	Fushichou Buyou	Blocks - It feels as though the attack hasn't connected at all. At this level of mastery, if the dancer knows the attack is coming, can move so that it only grazes the skin, turning the enemy's attack into an opportunity for a counter. Throws are quick and forceful, and if the opponent doesn't recover, will definitely set himself up for a second successive throw. Kicks - It seems to any spectator that the user, instead of employing normal movements to skirt around the enemy, is actually using kicks to move forward or backward, making every step he takes into a fast and furious blur of striking leg muscle. Jumps - High dexterous jumps, beautiful glides, lively spins and dives, all with the danger that a snap kick will be thrown your way if you get too close. While traveling, the user practically flies, as though invisible air pads are carrying him farther than is humanly possible. Of course, the strain piles up on the user over continual use. Sweeps - Similar to the previous stage; about the only difference is that the user can perform two sweeps swift enough to hit the opponent's feet and smack into his head region right before he hits the ground. Dodges - Dodging itself has not improved. However, if and when the user's head touches the ground as he bends over, he will turn it into a backflip to return to his feet.	3	5	1			33	38	28		20	24			
976	1	1	Decaying Fist	Chou Jin Genkotsu	Pain threshold: Barely nominal, the student is at the most basic Stage and cannot take much pain whatsoever.Fighting Tactics: What tactics? You know how to brawl and that's about it. None of that fancy martial arts crap has even dawned on you yet. You're just a bit stronger and a bit tougher than the people around you and you know it.	4		5	Simple tactics say you should always go for your enemy's weak points. A man's crotch is just such a weak point, and a swift rising knee will do far more than a similar strike to his chest. Although by the time you can smash rocks with the decaying fist, such a simple manoeuvre will do slightly more than incapacitate someone.		3		5						
976	2	2	Decaying Fist	Chou Jin Genkotsu	Pain threshold: Though a bit more tolerant of pain than a Stage 1 student or other characters, the user is still mentally undisciplined.Fighting Tactics: You've got some experience under your belt. You know when head butt instead of punch and you've got the whole go for his eyes thing pat down along with your foot stamps, and dirty knee strikes.	5		4	StompA simple practice, but one that scales so well as the decaying fist grows in power. You quite simply step on their foot. At this stage it merely distracts your opponent from the fight allowing you a few more vital hits. Although at higher levels you might as well give your opponent a doggy bag to put his pieces in.		6		8		6				
976	3	3	Decaying Fist	Chou Jin Genkotsu	Pain threshold: Students at this Stage are still getting used to pain, so they can still be mentally overwhelmed. Only a few attacks can be absorbed at a time, before the student becomes distracted from the fight.Fighting Tactics: The decaying fist is finally beginning to show itself here, and you've learned how to throw a good punch without fear of retaliation. You're starting to shy away from the little strikes in favour of the big heavy hitters that'll just end the fight.	4		5	Step InBy moving into a blow before it's ready to strike you, you can rob it of its full power and dampen its effects. For example, if someone is extending their arm to strike you and their fist hits you before their arm is fully extended the blow won't be as hard. A useful technique to minimize the damage you take.	MasochismBrute strength comes at a price. Speed is almost completely sacrificed in the decaying fist and while sheer patience and cunning tactics can completely mitigate this sometimes a particularly tricky prey shows up. Masochism explosively expands the muscles in the body at the exact impact point, and attempts to counter a blow with brute force. Basically, if they punch you, you may strike at their attack with half your strength score. This may be enough to completely stop the attack all together - or even break their fist if the difference is large enough. Still though, some prey is simply too fast to counter in this manner even if this technique does even the odds slightly. (Note: This does not mean the user does not take any damage)	8		12		8				
976	4	4	Decaying Fist	Chou Jin Genkotsu	Pain threshold: Students are beginnings to show progress. Now capable of absorbing a succession of quick blows without flinching, fighters at this Stage can begin learning how to strike within the opponent's attack.Fighting Tactics: Punches don't really phase you anymore so by all means take a minuet to just laugh at the people who are trying to hurt you before showing them how to really punch and if all goes to plan you'll knock them six ways from Sunday. Then you'll be able to bask in the glory while enjoying a cool drink.	5		4	An eye for an eyeDespicable, disgusting and used for intimidation more than anything else, an eye for an eye requires little physical ability by itself. However, the decaying fist needs enough power to be able to hold someone still. If they can do that though this technique is simply performed by reaching towards an opponent and plucking out their eye. Painful, crippling and terrifying for all involved it is nevertheless more useful as a scare tactic than an actual battlefield pratice.	MukuukenA special technique born of inhuman dedication and forged from countless days of grueling work. It is an unforgiving technique where you simply pound away unconsciously: fists break, tendons tear, strength dies and yet you still thrust.At this end of this repetition your brain - not even your spinal chord - are needed. When the fist attacks, it attacks through the will of the fist alone. Primarily, this is used against those who think they can simply attack the mind of the decaying fist to ensure themselves an easy kill. Simply, whenever your mind is incapacitated (hypnosis, fear, etc) your body will still react and strike at those who would dare try and kill you at close range.However, Mukuuken will not work if your mind has been duped. Should you believe a bunshin is real and not your opponent to your left your body will not strike the real threat. Only when your mind cannot or will not act does mukuuken take effect. (Note: Although this technique is an sub-conscious, reflexive attack, it still counts as an attack)	18	3	21		14				
976	5	5	Decaying Fist	Chou Jin Genkotsu	Pain threshold: Almost frightening. Now that students have learned how to sublimate their natural response to pain, they can walk through powerful blows from opponents and continue to fight, seemingly unaffected.Fighting Tactics: With your pain tolerance you have no qualms about just waiting for an opponent to hit you so you can get yourself an opening. Singular, powerful hits are also the name of the game here, but you've got to be careful with how you plant your finishing blows because you know you can't fight at full power for very long.	4		5	A bloody handAt this level of physical prowess the Decaying Fist is strong enough to shatter trees with its bare hands. Unfortunately for everyone else, human bone isn't quite as tough. To be very blunt, the user simply clamps his hand around someone's face and begins to squeeze. Should nothing be done to stop this, the end results is more than likely to get rather messy.	A Crown of ThornsTo the decaying fist a punch or a kick is as nothing. Most hits simply do not damage, do not bruise, and do not even hurt. Pointy weapons of all kinds on the other hand are an annoyance. They have a nasty tendency to penetrate flesh, sever muscles, and damage the body as a whole. Enter A Crown of Thorns. Expanding on using their own superhuman strength, a practitioner of the Decaying Fist channels their chakra and hyper-contracts their muscles as the weapon enters their flesh. This almost fuses their skin and their muscles over the invading metal object rendering it completely stuck, and utterly useless. Battle can quickly see practitioners become pincushions of twisted metal - possibly forming a kind of metal armour from dried blood and shrapnel. (Note: This still severely damages the user)	25	6	25		16				
976	6	6	Decaying Fist	Chou Jin Genkotsu	Pain threshold: Inhuman. All but the most powerful of punches and kicks are shrugged off. The fighter can now take on multiple opponents and walk through their physical strikes, while concentrating fully on their own attacks. They can absorb blows from bladed and spiked weapons without flinching, and often do so, just to laugh at their opponent.Fighting Tactics: Your tactics haven't changed much since the last level, but your no longer worried about pointy weapons. I mean, its not like they did anything anyway, but you've finally shed your ability to feel them.	5		4	PunctureAn apt name for a fearsome technique, puncture as it implies is simply the acquisition of enough raw, brute strength to allow your limbs to tear through people rather than simply turning their bones into chalk dust. With this you can effectively amputate people, decapitate them, or merely blow holes in their chests with your feet! Using this technique does not, however, automatically give the ability to hurt an opponent so dramatically. However, the potential is there.		30	10	35		21	15			
976	7	7	Decaying Fist	Chou Jin Genkotsu	Pain threshold: Almost godlike. Even strikes that would normally kill lesser men fail to faze these fighters. Fighters at this Stage have been impaled by spears, have had limbs chopped off and kept fighting, only dropping once the last of their blood has left their body.Fighting Tactics: What more is there to say? You walk up to someone and rip their arms off. Or perhaps you'll just decide to kick them in the face and smear their brains across the countryside this time. Whatever you do, your only plan of action is 'hit the bastard once' and anything else is just there to help you do that. No questions asked and no quarter given.	4		5		QuakeThere is nothing mystical or fancy about this technique. The decaying fist simply stomps their foot into the ground and - with sheer strength alone - they create a localised earthquake capable of demolishing nearby structures, deforming the landscape, and throwing people off their feet in a 15ft radius. It works even better if you jump and land with both feet on the ground.Blood of the DevilThis technique is a horrifying and unholy ability. It allows a master of the decaying fist to continue to fight beyond what the human body could possibly take, to continue to kill and murder with their mortal shells a mere shattered husk. Chakra is used to forcibly sustain, animate and hold together what might have once passed for a human being. With this technique, a master could reattach his severed arms and keep using them, continue to fight with no heart or lungs, or even to crawl after an opponent as a mere severed head - scraping along the ground with their teeth - ever hungry for blood and victory. Truly though, this is a technique of last resort for it turns any man mad enough to use it into a gibbering demon devoid of reason and driven only by the desire to kill. This will last for three posts, and at the end of the third their bodies will simply give out and crumble - nay explode - from the pressures forced upon them.	40	19	40		25	19			
975	1	1	Killer's Resonance 	Satsui no Hadou		5	4			Nanaten (7 Heavens)The user is able to hit one of the pressure points that will lead up to death. This technique although is not instant, but it will cause the body to cease function in all manners after all 7 hits are completed. This technique cannot be used without opponent permission. Also, death cannot be delivered without the finishing blow, 'Shun Goku Satsu.(Yes, the 2 points at the bottom will be on the front side of the legs.)Tenma no Kamae (Stance of Divine Demon)A quick stance that basically involves both hands, one top and one bottom, move in a circular pattern, each moving a full circle in counter-clockwise rotation. This technique basically helps the practitioner to focus his energy for his next attack. Giving him a 10% Speed point boost on the next action and thus wearing off after that one action. The next post will give the user a 10% reduction to the original Speed stat. The third post, Speed will return to normal. This only applies to the original stat without bonuses. If there is no level change, then Speed does not significantly change.	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
975	2	2	Killer's Resonance 	Satsui no Hadou		5	4			Suichoken (Water Crane Fist)The user keeps his hands straight like a dagger or sword and uses it to stab at an opponent. To those who do not have a high defense, this technique can easily slice through you like a sharp edge. If (Speed + Strength)/2 is greater than opponents stamina, then slicing effect can occur. If defense is equal to or higher than the stat, then this technique will only be like a normal punch.	6	8	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
975	3	3	Killer's Resonance 	Satsui no Hadou		5	4			Tenha no Kamae (Stance of all Under Heaven)A quick stance that basically involves both hands, one top and one bottom, move in a circular pattern, each moving a full circle in clockwise rotation. This technique basically helps the practitioner to focus his energy for his next attack. Giving him a 10% strength point boost on the next attack and thus wearing off after that one attack. The next post will give the user a 10% reduction to the original strength stat. The third post, strength will return to normal. This only applies to the original stat without bonuses. If there is no level change, then strength does not significantly change.	8	12	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
975	4	4	Killer's Resonance 	Satsui no Hadou		5	4			Muukaiken (No Limit Fist)The user basically punches the air with open palms to create a shockwave of wind. This wind can hit up to Ã‚Â½ the total power of strength stat and distance equal to 1/10 of Speed stat (in meters). This attack is great for a set up, throwing your opponent off guard, or easily dispatch of weaker opponents.	18	22	3	0	14	0	0	0	0
975	5	5	Killer's Resonance 	Satsui no Hadou		5	4			Musou TenseiMusou Tensei is a rapid succession of slow and quick movements to confuse your opponent. It will seem like there is multiple copies of you that are transparent. This is not an attack but rather an evasive maneuver that easily drains the user of stamina. Though it is hard to tell which one is the true form. Since the user will be concentrated in using this technique, offense is hindered so that strength will only be equal to Ã‚Â½. Due to the extreme drain on stamina, this technique can only be used for one post. Using it longer then a post will cause the user to collapse after finishing. The maximum limit for usage is three posts.	25	25	6	0	16	0	0	0	0
975	6	6	Killer's Resonance 	Satsui no Hadou		5	4			Shun Ten Satsu (Instant Heaven Slay) An incredibly dangerous technique that only the masters of the style is able to use. This technique is but a single strike using 2 hits. Since everything in the world has a resistance to shock and impact, this technique takes advantage of that resistance by giving a second attack before the first impact is fully absorbed. In this manner, the user us able to strike at an opponent while disregarding their defense (stamina defense) totally. This is able to allow the full power of the practitioner to be used on the opponent while completely negating physical defense. This technique can easily turn what would usually only crack to dust. IE. Rocks that usually crack or fall apart will instantly turn to dust with this technique. Due to action-reaction, this technique will also significantly harm the user as well, damaging the fist or foot of the user enough that it can barely be used for the rest of the thread. After this attack, the user cannot use this technique again in the same thread.Hyakuretsuken (100 crack fists)A simple yet deadly fast succession of 100 punches. This technique is basically used so that enemies who are Speedy have a hard time to dodge all the punches. Each punch should be considered to be 1/5 of total strength (rounded up). All the punches can be done in 1 post.	30	35	10	0	21	15	0	0	0
975	7	7	Killer's Resonance 	Satsui no Hadou		5	4			Shun Goku Satsu (Instant Hell Slay)After learning the final hit of the Nanaten, the practitioner is now able to use all 7 hits for an instant death kill. The finishing blow is Shun Goku Satsu. To be hit by Shun Goku Satsu is to instantly experience death. Opponent permission is needed to use this technique.	40	40	19	0	25	19	0	0	0
974	1	1	Flawless Guard	Ten'imuho Keishu	This stage is obviously quite clumsy, as it's the first stage. The user is farily weak as offensive combat, and although he or she can defend themselves better than most others at this level, they can still get hurt pretty easily. They can fight for a good amount of time without breaking a sweat, but nonstop action for an hour would force them to rest. It's considered dangerous to engage in a serious battle with only this first level mastered, the practitioners are too slow to generally catch the opponent off guard, and the strength is nothing special. At this point, the user is still training before he or she wants to even think about getting into a real fight.	2	2	5			4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
974	2	2	Flawless Guard	Ten'imuho Keishu	Everything begins to be rather useful. Although this stage is still quite weak, it is considered the beginning of the actual style, as instead of just being an amateur, training, it can actually be useful in combat. Of course, the combatant is able to fight longer, able to engage in action for quite a long time compared to most other taijutsu users at the same level. Of course, he or she can take hits easier, take more of them. Being used to fighting, there isn't really any trouble with engaging in combat, the user now knows how to think in battle, how to move without tripping, how to attack with control. Although it's relatively weak compared to some styles offensively, it ca be used in a fight, and the defensive power is very useful.	2	2	5			6	0	8	0	6	0	0	0	0
974	3	3	Flawless Guard	Ten'imuho Keishu	It's obvious that whoevers been using this style for this long has been rather devoted to it by this time. For someone that would specialize in the style, it'd take a good amount of time, and be nearly chuunin-level. Like with each stage, the ability to take attacks and stand still, able to withstand the pain without flinching, has reached a new high, and the style now shows exactly how frightening the guard can be, how difficult it is to penetrate. The mental state of the user is great enough to ignore pain, even if their body seems to suffer from it. Strong and quick enough to act well offensively, too, the user is able to fight on-par with any opponents, and even though the hits aren't quite as strong, and the reaction not as fast, the user of this style is able to take so much damage and fight for so long, that it gives them a sort of edge.	2	2	5			9	0	11	0	8	0	0	0	0
974	4	4	Flawless Guard	Ten'imuho Keishu	This is the point in the style that many often stop training at if they want to focus on something else, because as is, they're quite powerful defensively, even if they don't specialize in guarding themselves. It takes a lot of hard work to get to this point, a lot of suffering through such rigorous self-harming training, but it's all worth it. Pain can be easily ignored with the right train of thought and proper breathing, and even then, it's hard to harm the body too much anyway. The user can be in action for a great amount of time, and can fight well with a good increase in speed and strength, although the main factor, stamina, will always remain dominant. Basically, a good update in power from the previous stage.	2	2	5			15	13	15	0	14	0	0	0	0
974	5	5	Flawless Guard	Ten'imuho Keishu	Bonus Points: +5 Stamina, +2 Strength, +2 SpeedStamina can now be considered a specialty of the user, as this is a higher point of the style of combat. The skin is calloused, and while it can be damaged, opponents now require persistence. They can take more hits and can fight longer than most of their opponents of equal rank, and some higher, depending on the specialization of such shinobi. All in all, while many shinobi may study this style to offer a basis for stamina, such endurance becomes a highlight if this stage is learned.						18	18	20	0	16	0	0	0	0
974	6	6	Flawless Guard	Ten'imuho Keishu	While not at a stage of mastery, as it's very close, it's also very intimidating. Pain is easily ignored due to the mentality of the fighter under that mentality so often that it becomes natural. Even physically, it's very difficult for someone to even move a determined Keishuist from where they stand.	2	2	5			25	20	30	0	20	16	0	0	0
974	7	7	Flawless Guard	Ten'imuho Keishu	Masters of the style, and it shows. They are able to fight for long periods of time without breaking out into sweat, able to stand more physical hits, and even stand up after taking fairly powerful ninjutsu head-on. Defense, for these combatants, is not an issue.	2	2	5			35	24	40	0	25	19	0	0	0
973	1	1	Roar of the Beast	Yajuu no Houkou	At this stage the user is just starting to learn the style. They concentrate on aspects that will help springboard them into things they will learn later. The most basic aspects being charging into battle and hopefully bowling over an opponent or two while you are there. Everything is unrefined and at this point the person could barely be called a practitioner of the style so much as someone who knows of it.At this stage the user is barely training in the style, and usually is just seen swinging wildly.	5	4				4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
973	2	2	Roar of the Beast	Yajuu no Houkou	Ferocity- The idea of ferocity is brand new to the user. Attacks are obvious and weak, they also lack any of the brutal edge to get them recognized as a practitioner of Yajuu. Innocent growls and and roars may accompany their assualts.Instinct- Instinct is still undeveloped. Keeping the mind clear and focused to properly use the senses is something left for later training. Clues of nature that would be obvious to anyone are there. Horrible smells, bright lights, loud noises, are all good signs of bad things to come.Affinity- The user is still all but oblivious to nature's call. While most people would see the obvious, (Animals running, or disturbed.) Users of this style can see a bit deeper (Like signs of what they may be running from.). Beastmaster's with pets still rely on obvious verbal clues and cues to get their pets to coordinate attacks, but it still feels more natural then those not trained in this style.Stance Name: KuroKumaStance Bonus: +3 StrengthStance Description:The KuroKuma stance is difficult in early training. The stance requires full use of the upper body which many neophytes to the style interpret as having a stiff back. This still allows them to attack with stiff strikes, which are usually slow yet painful. The downside is that they suck at taking a hit.Stance Name: ShiroOokamiStance Bonus: +3 SpeedStance Description: In early training of ShiroOokami stance, users have trouble maintaining the low height that helps build up a large amount of speed. This leaves them open to more attacks and makes them slow at building momentum and slowing down.Stance Name: KinToriStance Bonus: +3 StaminaStance Description: The KinTori stance is one of the most difficult for a beginner. Acrobatic actions that require high jumps and flips are near impossible and the whole stance is relegated to first finger joint strikes and raking outward attacks.	2	2	2			7	0	7	0	6	0	0	0	0
973	3	3	Roar of the Beast	Yajuu no Houkou	Ferocity- Image is used to add to the visual effect of intimidation. Small pieces of natural fur or feathers may be added to outfits to make the user seem more barbaric. Attacks now seem wild and random enough to cause an uneasiness in enemies who see you go into stance for the first time. Swings and strikes look like they are running on instinct, the user barely in control of himself. Their growls and roars during assualts now at least sound like growls and roars, though their probably still more silly then scary.Instinct- Tracking abilities begin to be trained here. The sources and types of most noises can be identified, even if there is no enhancement to the ability to hear. This instinct helps catch on to the direction and intent of attacks that the user can hear but not see. The mind has become more focused, cutting out sounds that don't related to combat.Affinity- Smaller tells and clues can be used to get pets in time for coordinated attacks, namely non-verbal motions with the arms and hands. On top of that, Knowledge of nature grows. Knowing good places to hide and what ground has the best traction. This allows for better utilization of the surrounding area during combat.Stance Name: KuroKumaStance Bonus: +3 (+6) StrengthStance Description: While they haven't gotten over their stiff back and glass jaw, the KuroKuma stance has taken on a new special role. Because the strength utilized concerns the whole upper body, KuroKuma stance users now commonly use charging shoulders and headbutts to throw off an opponent who concentrates on their paws. Attacks are still slow and methodical, but less so then before.Stance Name: ShiroOokamiStance Bonus: +3 (+6) SpeedStance Description: Staying low in the stance is becoming easier at this stage, but speeding up to pounce on openings is still hard. The user still has trouble picking up the pace in the pinch. The slashing hand strikes are being developed at this stage, allowing for strikes with the nails that cause slight nicks and cuts.Stance Name: KinToriStance Bonus: +3 (+6) StaminaStance Description: High jumps become possible, lifting the user high enough to just barely leap over a person with grace. Usually attacks are a mix of basic and weak kicks, and short hops that end in downward strikes with the second finger joints. But at this stage, they cannot flip over the target for more acrobatic attacks. The use of outward pushes for defense starts here.	2	2	2			10	0	10	0	8	0	0	0	0
973	4	4	Roar of the Beast	Yajuu no Houkou	Ferocity- The user becomes more and more animalistic. Convincing growls and grunts now precede attacks, along with a wandering gaze with a strained eye. The user finally is starting to look like an animal, their head zipping back and forth to assess new threats, their body rigid in pose. Attacks are given at the last second, making them seem to come out of nowhere.Instinct- Tracking improves even more, Following animal footprints and dropping trails can easily lead to a prey's location. The sense of smell is better adapted in this level of training, the different types of smells, what they mean, what they come from, can allow a trained user to discern between different animal scents. The mind can also be cleared of unneeded scents to help better utilize this skill (though this doesn't stop them from inhaling bad things.). This does not enhance the usual power of the sense of smell though, and has little to no battle application.Affinity- Just a slight nod in the right direction is enough to get a pet in step for a coordinated attack. Distinct and complicated commands are now possible using subtle clues yet no spoken language. The user's understanding of animals has made them a friend of beast. Animals that are not being directly instructed (like from a beastmaster) to attack the user will be kind and gentle around them. This includes most beast that would otherwise be ferocious.Stance Name: KuroKumaStance Bonus: +3 (+9) StrengthStance Description: Finally the KuroKuma stance has been mastered in structure, so now application of it's power is the direction of training. The 'glass jaw' weakness is now gone,and many KuroKuma users like to throw themselves into the thick of combat to better get a chance to land a solid blow. While the upperbody stays in the curved-arm stance, the lower body has gained a level of mobility that makes their movements disorienting to those that expect the shinobi to move slowly.Stance Name: ShiroOokamiStance Bonus: +3 (+9) SpeedStance Description: The ShiroOokami stance has now reached a point to where it's actual intent is possible. ShiroOokami users stay low and ready to strike until their opponent gives them an opening, at which point they move forward with a burst of speed that allows them to give a swift strike. The circular 'rending strike' is also being developed, which has both arms move outwards and then in to rake both hands across one location at the same time, using the nails to cause damaging cuts. But at this point in training the rending strikes are slow and unwiedly.Stance Name: KinToriStance Bonus: +3 (+9) StaminaStance Description: Like a raptor in flight, the KinTori stance begins to become dangerous. Acrobatic movement, dodging back away from attacks and then jumping in to strike from just above, is the goal of the stance at this stage. Instead of going around someone, Kintori users will generally flip over them, maybe even striking with their arms sweeping outwards as they come down from the leap. The style is the most defensive of the three, usually hoping to avoid taking hits through staying on their toes and keeping opponents away.	2	2	2			15	13	15	0	14	0	0	0	0
973	5	5	Roar of the Beast	Yajuu no Houkou	Ferocity- Standard practitioners of this style would consider this perfection. "As complete as one would expect" of the everyday man. Their bodies muscles are left tensed and ready to act at the last moment, strategy and direction almost seem random yet sufficient. To an outsider the user may seem possessed in their ability to fight off threats that come within their range. Regardless of what they wear, their look and demeanor is enough now to make people second guess attacking them, constant growls and an overwhelming essence of pure rage seem to come from the user.Instinct- Tracking has become more ingrained, prey can be tracked by torn twigs and disturbed brush. Signs of passing like torn scenery, scents, footsteps, can all be followed if given the time to work through them all. But on top of this, the eyes have been trained. By watching something, it is easy for the user to see when they are preparing to move to strike through muscle and eye movements, or how fast things are moving to leave time to properly dodge. This level of understanding also allows them to clear their mind of all the chatter that may be going on at the edge of their vision. Things that are not considered a thread on the edge of the vision are ignored, making most basic distractions pointless.Affinity- The level of nature affinity does not get trained much at this level. Knowing more of nature and knowing the ins and outs of what is possible for different animals in combat are the full extent of it. Complicated strategies are now just as possible to relay to a pet as coordinated attacks.Stance Name: KuroKumaStance Bonus: +3 (+12) StrengthStance Description: One growling ball of rage. KuroKuma stance has trained the user to become a bulldozer of strength, jumping into a fight and taking wide one armed swings at anyone that manages to get in their way. They hit with enough strength to blow back anything that doesn't manage to dodge their attacks, leaving anyone hit slightly disoriented from the heavy blows.Stance Name: ShiroOokamiStance Bonus: +3 (+12) SpeedStance Description: The usual nature of the stance is nearing perfection. Being able to move from low stance to almost full speed in an instant, taking advantage of even foes that think they are too far away to be struck by the waiting wolf. The rending strikes are becoming as fast as normal attacks, causing greater cuts and slashes, allowing them to replace the rapid palm strikes usually prevalent in the stance.Stance Name: KinToriStance Bonus: +3 (+12) StaminaStance Description: Constant acrobatic motion. Flipping compeletly over a target, usually staying in the air longer then they are on the ground. The most defensive stance of the style is coming into it's own. Now twirls and twist are performed in the air to keep the target disoriented to where they will land or where air strikes will come from. Defensive pushes and shoves are used to keep dangerous foes away until the user can get back into the air.	2	2	2			20	16	20	0	16	0	0	0	0
973	6	6	Roar of the Beast	Yajuu no Houkou	Ferocity- The essence of rage, power, and confidence, all flow from the user in their movements and actions. Attacks are swift and the accuracy and coordination of them assures that anyone that witnesses the user will never doubt their combat prowess. Roars and Growls are now authentic, sounding even more frightening then the real deal.Instinct- Instinct is now all applied to combat. Though. Coordinating timing of footsteps heard, with attacks in the users realm of vision, they can assess everything happening around them to better attack and disable targets. This is done by drowning out all the leftover chatter of the mind, any doubt in the mind of their attacks, or even thoughts not related to the current battle, are now all gone as they focus on this one fight.Affinity- Without a word or a motion, the beastmaster and Pet are in step. They move like one, each knowing the others plans and motions from past experience and movements and the situation. Nature is their environment, and as long as they are outdoors, it is their terrain inside and out.Stance Name: KuroKumaStance Bonus: +3 (+15) StrengthStance Description: The actions of the KuroKuma stance have become even more violent. The strength gained from the stiff backed stance is now enough to knock a man off his feet from a single blow, and usually blows end after one or two clean hits. The downside of speed in the stance is now usually overcome using a combination of surprising skips forward, or using a forward roll.Stance Name: ShiroOokamiStance Bonus: +3 (+15) SpeedStance Description: The stance is perfected. Speed utilized in this stance is from a burst of movement, from zero to full in a quick burst of leg muscles which usually ends in a swift strike from both hands. ShiroOokami stance is now the stance to use when hoping to end a fight quickly, especially against weaker opponents.Stance Name: KinToriStance Bonus: +3 (+15) StaminaStance Description: The defensive nature of this stance has reached a peak. Keeping opponents at just the right distance while twirling around and over them in swift and acrobatic motions. While kicks were used early in the stance to keep foes away, now they are reapplied to mid-air attacks, creating daring flips that end in flipping kicks.	2	2	2			28	19	28	16	20	0	0	0	0
973	7	7	Roar of the Beast	Yajuu no Houkou	Ferocity- The final stage, legendary ferocity and anger all coiled into a human being. Their appearance when they go into stance is identical to that of a beast in the field. Their actions are swift, exact, and deadly. Their roars and words are intimidating, sounding authentic and strong. They are enough to scare off even the scariest animals of the world.Instinct- Instinct is now complete, they are complete in their understanding of the world around them and their instinct on someone's upcoming actions are usually true. Though it would appear prophetic to those around them, this is instead an accumulation of knowledge of how things move in battle, when in a situation of life or death.Affinity- Pet and Beastmaster now move as one, animals and nature bend to the users will. At this stage, even a pet owned by another beastmaster will be hesitant to move against the practitioner of this style.Stance Name: KuroKumaStance Bonus: +3 (+18) StrengthStance Description: The stance at perfection, symbolizing all that is the black bear. All past faults of the style are missing, and the style can now focus itself on getting in range for that killing paw strike.Stance Name: ShiroOokamiStance Bonus: +3 (+18) SpeedStance Description: The stance at perfection, symbolizing all that is the white wolf. The past faults in gaining momentum and stopping have all been eradicated. Now the wolf can wait for that perfect opening and strike with a deadly claw.Stance Name: KinToriStance Bonus: +3 (+18) StaminaStance Description: The stance at perfection, symbolizing all that is the golden raptor. The past faults in defense are now gone, as the user has perfected the keep away style of the stance leading into deadly debilitating strikes. The user flies like a bird, and strikes just as hard.	2	2	2			35	29	35	20	24	0	0	0	0
972	1	1	Infinite Loop	Mugen Rupu	At this stage the mugen is apt at basic moves and basic techniques. The focus is on movement, footwork and kicks. They have learned to never be still; mugen are always rocking from side to side. For an onlooker their moves are deliberate and linear. More agile than the untrained shinobi, they are not as flexible. The hands are not incorporated much at this stage for anymore than defense or cartwheels or spins.		4	5			0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
972	2	2	Infinite Loop	Mugen Rupu	At this stage the mugen involves their whole body and is more flexible. Movements are more sophisticated and fluid and involve rolls and handstands, which makes it easier to dodge. The motions still appear stiff & practiced compared to masters. The mugen becomes more brutal, using takedowns, traps, headbutts, feints and leg sweeps. Punches are also peppered into bouts, but the primary use remains leg attacks.		4	5			0	7	7	0	0	6	0	0	0
972	3	3	Infinite Loop	Mugen Rupu	At this stage the mugen aims to overwhelm and be unpredictable. Fast, nimble, ever moving and unorthodox, the mugen range expands to aerial attacks and mild acrobatics. Training has refined the mugen to have powerful legs, and uses their upper body for torque in handstands, cartwheels and spinning kicks. The mugen is comfortable spinning on their back, hands like they're break-dancing to a beat. All parts of the limbs are apart of the battle at this point. There are tackles, elbows, knees, headbutts, as well as kicks & punches in the midst of their spins.		4	5			0	10	10	0	0	8	0	0	0
972	4	4	Infinite Loop	Mugen Rupu	The speed increases but the objective is the same: overwhelm. Now the fighter is acrobatic. No angles are unexplored. The mugen is never in one place. Whether they catapult from somersaults, half-moon cartweels, backspins or the wall, their momentum carries them along for damaging blows. There is constant pivoting, positioning and leaps. This is where a novice becomes an adept, using the environment as a tool in the onslaught. Combos are meant to be fatal and brutal. The objective is not to string out the fight, but create explosive damage from whichever angle hurts the worst. At this stage, the fighter begins to show their bloodsport roots and yank at mouths, pull nostril holes and strike to win.		4	5			13	15	15	0	0	14	0	0	0
972	5	5	Infinite Loop	Mugen Rupu	Where before the objective was to overwhelm with misdirections, now becomes more of the same but at a faster pace that doesn't seem to end. Combo attacks are strung together. So flexible and trained, the mugen can stand on any limb with complete ease. At this point, the aspects of feinting, timing, and forcing your user to over-extend themselves is second nature. You dodge, not with the objective to evade, but to place your enemy in a position where you can lead the fight the way you please. This is when everything looks fluid. At this point, you don't worry much about how long the fight is -- you can last, and you can overwhelm.		4	5			16	20	20	0	0	16	0	0	0
972	6	6	Infinite Loop	Mugen Rupu	A stage no one has yet to exceed. The mugen has neared perfection. Now, they are a bloodthirsty cyclone on the battle field, twisting or spinning on hand or at the waist, leg or back to evade any strike. An expert in momentum and dexterity, they are renown for absorbing blows and following the kinetic energy into counter attacks. The mugen is always on the offensive and never slows. The feints have become more sophisticated at this point as they bait would-be assailants in close quarters to be trapped into barrage of combo kicks, and movements which are unpredictable, swift and constant.Their physiques is impeccable, built with explosive thighs & thin core. When fighting, they are a blur now. And, if one can somehow keep up, they'll seem to see a man dancing around their enemy like a maestro.		4	5			20	28	27	16	0	20	0	0	0
972	7	7	Infinite Loop	Mugen Rupu	The apex.The weapon, a zenith of pure destruction, the mugen has exceeded all limits, perfected the style, and bares the eye of a feral dancer, always catching its targets misstep of misfortune into doom a midst the whirl of handstands, low & high heel-kicks and helicopters leg sweeps. Even without the assistance of walls, the expert mugen can bounce off air itself, doing full aerial 360 to 1080 degree twist & flips as they spike tackle enemies from all angles.Their speed on ground and airborne makes them nearly impossible to locate a midst battle. Sequenced with aggressive Kyusho manuevers, they can and will destroy you from the outside-in. Stacking dance move flare with blinking fast freezes (stylish poses to end/begin freestyle break-dancing) they will dance all over your body, soul and absolutely [bleep] you up. And your friends, maybe, you're a whole army.		4	5			28	36	35	20	0	24	0	0	0
971	1	1	Illusion Fist	Madioken	The student has begun to scratch the surface, but now no more than that. It is not required that you be good at what you do yet, but merely have the ability to work with the Madoiken in the first place. In the end nothing more serious than the prick of a needle can be replicated in a victim, if you have to gall to call them that at this point. It's not so much the lack of thought or effort on the user's part; they simple lack of ability to actually do anything.		3			Manegoto [Make Believe]Few things are easier to guide than the human mind. All one needs to do in order to properly fool them is to show exactly what they expect, Manegoto taps into this naivety. While the student may be able to create sensations on the body, there is still no change to what they see. That all changes when this technique is active; be it lumps of skin filled with parasites to a sword wound, this utility technique adds an extra level of visual realism to all a user normal techniques in this list.	0	0	0	4	4	0	0	0	0
971	2	2	Illusion Fist	Madioken	By now the student has used their skills enough that their beginning to grow comfortable with the concepts, and is ready to begin the true learning. The most mundane way to use this pain would be to replicate something akin to a kunai stab, but more creative minds will think of far more interesting implications. Migraines, crawling insects, and cramps abound! Still, at this point the Genjutsu are little more than distractions.As the student learns to cause harm to their opponents in combat through the mental field, they must learn how to first reach them. With the instruments of their trade set firmly in place, users have set it in themselves to reimagine fighting. A gentle style if there ever was one, the idea is not to harm your foe, but to touch them. Their movements are stiff and unrefined now, and continually stretch to make their body more supple.		3			Shokubutsu: Memai (Plant: Vertigo)The first real '˜Plant' technique implemented into the style, Vertigo causes the target to be overwhelmed by the condition from which it derives it's namesake by recreating the status that invokes it. First, it causes the target to feel unsteady on their feet due to false messages from their inner ear, and watch as everything in front of them suddenly seems so very far away. This lasts for no more than a second, but is very distracting, as it often fools the mind and body into falling into the real stage of vertigo.Shokubutsu: Nakidasu Tsubame (Plant: Weeping Swallow)A simple plant technique that draws upon ones subconscious regrets and wishes. Upon its initiation, Tsubame will cause what many think to be their conscience to impress itself onto the situation. More often than not, it is a cry of forgotten innocence, the conscience long buried revived in the form of something the victim is very attached to, or simply respects. Be it a loving mother, an oppressive father, a childhood friend, or a powerful superior. The Genjutsu suggests that ceasing ones attack will please these spirits.	0	6	0	7	0	0	0	0	0
971	3	3	Illusion Fist	Madioken	What the student knows of causing pain does not change; however they learn to reach further with their chakra; touching more nerves and covering up to a foot away from whatever part of the body was hit. Some examples of what might be done; a mild burning, a multitude of '˜creatures' underneath the target's skin, and more, though the effect must be constant. Even now, what the student can do could be nothing more than a diversion.Practice has made a student's bodies flexible enough to try a hand at what real movements in the style mean. More often than not, a blow will be both stronger and faster than a user can dodge or counter on their own, so they learn to roll with it. To take the edge off blows they must endure and make those they don't seem a near-miss, and reach around with their hands to trap the attacker in a different world.		3			Shokubutsu: Youma Batsu (Plant: Spirit's Strike)In the field of Genjutsu, the unexpected is always good. Sometimes, a straightforward jolt of pain simply doesn't cut it; and for those times there is the Youma Batsu. The student is capable of using the normally instantaneous transference as a plant, and therefore gaining the element of surprise. If all goes well, the enemy will find themselves besieged by illusionary pain from many angles at once, as if struck by phantoms.	0	8	0	10	10	0	0	0	0
971	4	4	Illusion Fist	Madioken	Schooled in theory, either by themselves or others, a student of the Maidoken style is able to inch into this next level of growth. Once more the practitioner expands their repertoire to include key abilities for their field. Whereas before they had been able to create illusions on or just under the skin of the afflicted, limiting their techniques to the most mundane of distractions, the studentcan now extend their chakra deeper. Deep slashes, probing scalpels, second degree burns; here the Maidoken ceases to be an annoyance and starts becoming the terror it was first meant to be. However, the unfortunate trade off is that they are limited once more to the area covered by their palms.To abbreviate, at this level the studentis able to create illusions of pain or discomfort several inches beneath a person's skin that replicates substantial wounds or effects.Distractions become imperative to allowing attacks to land, so the user becomes versed in them. A forward strike with their palm while the other hand aims to poke at the enemies chest as they dodge, calm misdirection of both real and imaginary qualities; the student can avoid notice, and control it when avoiding becomes impossible.		3			Akuratsu Aruji (Crafty Master)Over time, the student has grown in the subtly of their techniques to such a degree where they become nearly unnoticeable. Their attacks are made and completed with new ease, and therefore their stamina in using the Genjutsu here increases. By now the practitioners are so familiar with the pathways of the mind that finding new hiding places becomes a simple endeavor.Note: this allows the student to ignore the presence of one Plant when concerning Genjutsu Stacking.Tejina (Sleight of Hand)In these years of training utility techniques are in no short supply. The Tejina was designed for the more artful, evasive types in the Shinobi world. In the passing years it becomes possible to spawn an illusion through the slightest touch of ones hand, as opposed to the palm strikes or grapples used previously. Fists, slaps, and pokes with your fingertips all hold the potential to bring whatever unfortunate soul is on the receiving end to hell. However, most of the more advanced arts, such as plants and their greater brethren, must be initiated the old fashioned way.Yakkaimono: Itamu Tahibari (Parasite: Lamenting Lark)The first in the line of Parasitic techniques, Tahibari is the user's first venture away from pain and toward their softer underbellies. Once initiated, the victim will begin experiencing short, traumatic, and oft exaggerated flashbacks, all the while with their thoughts clouded with whispers or even screams of those contained therein. Depending on the person, it could send them bawling, or do nothing at all. Such is the nature of Tahibari, as each illusion is entirely self-induced.	0	10	4	14	15	14	0	0	0
971	5	5	Illusion Fist	Madioken	As the student finally begins to learn the subtle intricacies of the mind, the true problem becomes clear to them. The issue in the Madoiken is precision; the most subtle of messages allow for far more complex, painful things to be woven within the hands of the practitioner, and inserted into others to measure the result. Bones splinter apart, and their skin burns clear off the skin in moments. Any ordinary person would be reduced to a shivering, defeated wretch from half an hour alone with a user, and in combat it is certain to have some effect, if they manage to get their hands on them.Still, while it may be possible to reach into a body and seemingly crush an organ, the student is still limited in what he can reach with that pain. They cannot reach to an area further than two feet coverage from where they first touched, and while they can cause a singular effect in a specific area (A clean break in a bone) they cannot cause more than one effect.By now, their physical abilities have reached new heights. Their body bends and twists like a willow in a storm, making attacks that seem to hit their mark evaporate into nothing or near-nothing on impact. Their touch has become more subtle, and hands quicker than any pickpocket. Their movements are fluid and, when they allow it to show, carry a vipers grace.		3			Yakkaimono: Youma Houyou (Parasite: Spirit's Embrace)Special Requirements: Youma BatsuAnother variation of the normally simple task present in causing anguish through pain, Houyou represents a parasitic version of its kin. Unlike previous alliterations, it takes effect immediately, and stays there. By now it's less a tool to invoke surprise and more a way of creating a torturous environment. The student is capable of imbuing effects two stages below their current skill into the Houyou.Yakkaimono: Fureru no Fuannai (Parasite: Touch of Ignorance)Perhaps more dangerous than the ability to create the unseen is to hide what ones enemy would normally see. Fureru no Fuannai works to play with the target's mind, hiding the feeling of the user's touch and all effects that might come thereafter while subtly suggesting that they were never touched at all. This technique is unique in that it does not bring up the same pains and powers throughout its duration, but maintains a singular illusion while the fight drags on. Many an opponent has perished from very real, simple things that they might have otherwise seen and prevented had this technique not been initiated.	7	13	0	19	19	18	0	0	0
971	6	6	Illusion Fist	Madioken	As the student grows more and more proficient in using the ability they have, in the end they come to realize that in their minds eye such calm is needed to strike true; a calm that could maintain itself in the heart of a cyclone. With accuracy greater than any arrow they strike, playing ever more with the senses of those that call themselves '˜victims.' Rather than an increase in overall power, the student finds that they are able to strike at many points with what was one. What was once a clean break may now become a bone cleanly sliced in three places, or whips pounding relentlessly. As such, three individual effects can be stimulated at any one time.Normal people would be hard pressed to stay sane when exposed to such torment for longer than the briefest moment, and the hardiest of Shinobi are plagued by nightmares of it. Some call it inhumane, but in the end it is just a means to an end. Few will stand in the way of a person holding this kind of power at their disposal.Neither particularly fast, strong, or tough; a student is relaxed completely, at all times. No punches, kicks, or other normal physical damage is done; just grapples and gentle prods here and there. If you're careless when you blink, it's not impossible for you to find two hands wrapped around your neck. By now one is able to quite literally bend over backwards easily without falling, and the same suppleness is present throughout their limbs. If they can't wriggle out of something, no one can.		3			Shokubutsu: Warawa Tei (Plant: I spy)One of the crueler Plants in a student's arsenal, Tei represents the end all of emotional techniques within this type. A victim's eyesight will be overwhelmed by a vision of someone precious to them ending. If they have no precious person alive, it will go after one dead. If there is no one they love period, it will become a vision of a concept or place meeting an untimely demise. Finally, if none of the above applies, they will witness themselves as victim to this torment. In the event that one in particular is crueler than any other, that effect will show itself regardless of whether those before it are possible. Of course, during the post this vision is presented to them, they are completely blind.Sokuseki: Tsukaisugi (Instant: Overload)Sometimes, things like prisoners are extremely hard to transport. This aspect of being a shinobi is heightened a thousand times when the people you're transporting have the ability to reduce entire landscapes to rubble. Tsukaisugi eliminates the hassle normally present in transporting a powerful foe by overwhelming each of their five senses. In this state, they are incapable of telling where their limbs are, what they're seeing, what is touching them, or even if they're moving at all. To properly initiate this technique, the student must have a firm grip on them for two posts, after which resistance will evaporate.Yakkaimono: Setsudan (Parasite: Amputation)Special Requirements: TejinaThe caress of soft fingers, a mocking tap in the midst of battle; that is all this technique first appears to be. However, Setsudan quickly reveals itself to be a far more sinister Genjutsu. In the post following its initiation, the limb struck by this technique will begin to creak and rot; stretch against its using holster before tearing away from and plopping to the ground, turning to dust before their eyes. In reality, the arm has been numbed to the point where they can no longer tell it exists, and rendered invisible to their eyes. Even if they somehow see through this Genjutsu, the simple fact of the matter is they cannot use their arm, leg, or whatever was struck through normal means because they cannot see or feel it.	0	19	17	25	25	25	0	0	0
971	7	7	Illusion Fist	Madioken	Time passes, and a hundred students live and die without ever reaching this. Men who, even had their inner coils ripped from them, carry a weight of knowing enough to quiet crowds. An air of calm, movements full of greatest certainty; the world is a storm, and they its eye. Perhaps somewhere, sometime, another with greater potential waits. Pray they are never born.Some might think that anything more than what was listed before would be unnecessary, but on occasion even cruel doesn't describe what is needed to extract what is necessary. At the slightest touch, bones will seem to detonate, spines will split down the middle and try to pry them in two, and a thousand needles will pierce through defiant eyes.Now, not only can the user reach five feet in any direction along the body from the point of touch, but the number of individual effects rises to six. On top of this, it is possible to cause a particularly cruel effect, such as those listed above, one individual affliction that has no limits in pain of any kind. One that easily breaks past what a body could normally take before springing from this mortal coil. In the event that a target is bound and restrained, a user can use it as they will; but the pace of combat makes it so that they can only focus enough to do it once in intervals of about six seconds. (Two posts)There is little to discuss in the department of physical development that has not already been mentioned. Calm at all times; a user dodges and strikes in the same smooth motions. In absolute control of their body as it bends and moves, few other than contortionists can exceed their ability to bend in whichever way, and none the way they avoid notice while doing so.		3			Sokuseki: Hitokage Sesshu (Instant: Soul Theft)Special Requirements: Yakkaimono: Youma Houyou, Admin Approval, Opponents PermissionThrough the usage of countless Genjutsu, the user has finally reached that destined point, the time when death itself becomes mercy in their presence. A technique designed to bring a body to its natural limits, Sesshu mimics the process of '˜death' in a captives mind. Their fingers go cold and numb, their pulse slows, and eventually their mind ceases in all functions over the course of one post. In ancient times, powerful shinobi used this Jutsu on their enemies and left the shallow husks to remind others of who they were, what they could do. Legends say these same men were demons who fed on souls, though users of this style know the truth. This leaves one in a quasi-perfect coma.Yakkaimono: Sujou (Parasite: Origins)A true Genjutsu user recognizes that it's not torture that's most moving, but the prodding of old wounds that is torture. This Jutsu relies on mental scars left by trauma both physical and mental, causing frequent flashbacks in the case of the later. However, in the case of the former, the oft exaggerated pain from all periods of their life plagues them, brought once more to the surface by invasive illusion. In the first post, they're plagued with random visions of their more tender years. If there is a second, it is bound to be filled with screams as every bit of pain they may have experienced resurfaces to haunt them. This Jutsu relies entirely on the memories and emotions of the afflicted, meaning that it is not necessarily what it truly felt like, but more of a brutal dramatization of these injuries.	0	26	18	33	33	33	0	0	0
970	1	1	Bloodstained Footsteps	Chimamire Kutsuoto	At this level, the user is an eyesore to look at in comparison to a more accomplished foot-fighter. Speed may be higher, but movements are jerky, at best. Weak points are practically everywhere. The power in kicks is slightly higher than the average, untrained foot-fighte, but most often it's nothing to raise a fuss about.The user here is unable to change the direction of the kick once initiated.	2	5	2	ShovelThe user will surreptitiously dig his foot into the ground, and wait for the opponent to charge. At the last moment, the user will heave his foot up, delivering a faceful of earth (dirt, or rocks, depending on what's in the ground) to the opponent's face. (Must be done facing the target)		6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
970	2	2	Bloodstained Footsteps	Chimamire Kutsuoto	A definite improvement from the previous stage; now the user at least doesn't come off like a marionette robot. Some work is still needed to refine legwork and so on, but in general, the user is as fluid as a novice ballerina. The power behind kicks is at least something to work with, and while others may think a foot-fighter silly for not using his hands, a kick to the shin will leave them hopping for days.The user is still focused on bringing a straight-forward attack, so directional change ability has not improved.	3	4	2	The Reptile's Double StrikeCharging towards the opponent head on, the user will bound forwards, flying through the air feet first. The dominant foot will strike the opposite shoulder ( right foot will hit the target's left shoulder, left foot to right shoulder), and immediately after, the CKer's other foot will plant itself across the cheek of the unlucky fellow and knock him aside. (Must be done facing the opponent)Stunted BlowUsually when an adversary moves to attack, their assault requires a certain amount of space before it can reach optimum strength. By moving into that attack, the power of their blow is cut short and lessened, while additionally some of the impetus is absorbed. Stunted Blow is that very counter, by throwing a kick at the attack before the enemy's strike can reach full force. At this stage, Stunted Blow doesn't make all that much of a difference. As one progresses through the list, however, Stunted Blow becomes more effective at what it does. (Must be done facing the opponent)		10	4	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
970	3	3	Bloodstained Footsteps	Chimamire Kutsuoto	Flow and grace has definite made some progress here. However, in aerial kicks, the user is still a bit shoddy, but when it comes to groundwork, the movements are elegant and flow very well. Some points of attack are still open, but it would take a skilled opponent to find and hit one. With much more power, now, the user can definitely hold his own in a fight against someone on the same level as them physically. When matched up against a greater student, though, they look like nothing.The user now has a firm grasp of bodily movement, and can begin to change the direction of an attack in mid-kick form. However, if striking full force, it takes a buffer space of one foot to slow down before the direction can be reversed or changed in any way. Only one direction change is able to be managed.	3	4	2	Double CrescentThe user first dashes toward the opponent, then leaps and flips forwardto execute an axe kick. If the attack succeeds, the user will then flip forward again for a second axe kick. If the initial attack fails, the user will backflip this time to hit the chin of the opponent. (Must be done facing the target)Scissor KickThe user will rush headlong towards the opponent, launching themself into a ferocious sideways feetfirst lunge at the target, legs spread apart. The feet will then close rapidly, like scissors. Scissor Kicks can often lead to clamping the opponent's head between the user's calves. (Must be done facing the target)		14	6	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
970	4	4	Bloodstained Footsteps	Chimamire Kutsuoto	At this stage, the user is much faster and much better at planning out footwork. Every step is carefully designed to advance the user's position, and to watch a user fight at this level is like looking at a work of art: beautiful. One twist leads to another, and it becomes hard to find an opening for a physical strike. Power has taken a huge boost, as now the user can easily perform the old 'wood panel breaking' trick without even thinking about it. Don't take this foot-fighter lightly, or you could end up with a five inch lump on the back of your head.The user has almost mastered his own legs to change the direction of kicks completely. It's still very shabby, but now the buffer space is no longer needed. Instead, when a directional change is attempted, the user will pause for a moment before a redirection is made. Only one direction change is able to be managed.	4	5		Dirty-Handed WindmillIn order to perform this technique, the user will...yes, have to get his hands dirty. While moving towards an opponent, the user will then invert himself to a handstand while extending his legs and spinning. However, due to the initial momentum before the inversion, the user will be able to walk on his hands while his legs are windmilling in the air. (Orientation does not matter)OOC: Basically the user will look like a 'T' spinning around and moving.FootholdThe user will leap at the opponent and slip one foot under the target's armpit and hook it there. Using that as an anchor to stay with the target, the user can then perform any other attack with his free foot; the main purpose of this technique is to latch onto the opponent in a surprising manner, pulling the opponent off balance since the user's body will be parallel with the ground. (Orientation does not matter)OOC: In essence it'll look like a '7'. The vertical line is the target, while the horizontal is the user, with his foot hooked under the armpit of the target.	Lion KickRunning at full speed, the CK fighter will quickly leap forwards, with one leg extended in a kick. A truly devastating blow, Lion Kick packs a huge punch to it, able to blow back an opponent for a distance of the user's [Strength] feet, no matter the target's weight or size (the damage felt, however, is only 3/4 of the user's Strength). What also makes the Lion Kick such a fierce assault is the fact that it can be used at a range. That's right, the leap before the kick is downright monstrous, covering [Strength] feet at most. Unfortunately, this move is quite fatiguing on the legs and can only be used [Stamina/5] times a thread.OOC:So if the user has 20 Strength, Lion Kick lets him leap 20 feet for the kick, hitting the target with 15 Strength and knocking them back 20 feet. Keep in mind that the leap is a horizontal, not a vertical one.	25	10	8	0	14	0	0	0	0
970	5	5	Bloodstained Footsteps	Chimamire Kutsuoto	Flips and leaps are a normal part of the user's repertoire now, and the user will throw in many in his routine. The best time for an opponent to strike the user would be after a flip, twist, or leap, when the user lands and pauses for a split second before the next movement. The magnitude of the user's kicks is now one to fear. A missed axe kick would bury the user's foot in the ground and raise a small cloud of dust and dirt. Imagine what that would do to the human body.The user is now accomplished enough to perform two directional changes without error or pause. For instance, the user could be sweeping in from his left, then an inch before he strikes, he will instantly reverse directions, spinning to land a sweeping kick from the right with the same leg.	4	5		Sky AxeThe user dashes at the target, but a few feet before contact, will drop down and slide on the ground, in a pose similar to a sprinter waiting for the gun to go off. When in range, the user will extend one leg back and out, then sweep around in a full circle. However, this sweep is just a decoy, and is easily avoidable. After the user has completed the full circle sweep, he'll launch himself into the air with a forward flip and come down with an axe kick to the fpe's noggin. (Must be done facing the target)Back BreakerHaving rushed at the target, the user will then leap forward, land one foot on the target's shoulder, and continue to push ahead. The target will be pushed in the direction he is facing as well, as the user will land behind him. The user will then land, curl into a ball and roll backwards until he is in range and on his back, then thrust out both legs together at the small of the opponent's back. (Must be done facing the target)	StrikerBy slamming his foot into the earth, when the user heaves upwards, a laundry machine sized boulder will pop into the air. This makes a convenient projectile for the user to kick and take a shot at the opponent. The range on this puppy is about 20 feet or so.OOC: Ideally, this would only work on rocky, solid ground.	30	15	11	0	16	0	0	0	0
970	6	6	Bloodstained Footsteps	Chimamire Kutsuoto	To watch a user fight at this stage would bring tears to a spectator's eyes. The user now is moving non-stop with a continuous series of dashes, flips, leaps, twists, sweeps, and so on. A solid kick to the torso would leave a target totally out of breath and aching for days. Changes are practically instantaneous now, happening in the blink of an eye. Four direction changes are able to be managed. For example, a sweep from the left can suddenly be pulled in and turned into a solid thrust.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques:Wind-Up TornadoThe user will dash and leap towards the opponent with a sweeping roundhouse. As the user is spinning towards the target in the air, the user will then change the direction and start spinning the other way with twice the force. (Orientation does not matter)Strike of the RobinThe user will leap into the air as high as he can, and while moving towards the opponent in mid-air, will backflip at the apex of his jump. Using the momentum from the spin, the user will then launch a descending kick at the target's chest. However, this first assault is just a feint. The user will land as lightly as possible, as intended, on the victim's chest, and will then continue the assault by letting his leg bend, smashing his knee into the target's face with as much force as possible. (Must be done facing the target)	CyclistBy throwing himself feetfirst towards the target in a ferocious jump, the user will actually be able to rain blow after blow upon the chest of the target as if he was pedalling a bicycle. The number of kicks is equal to half the user's base Stamina, but the strength of the kicks is only half of the user's base Strength. (Must be done facing the target)Free Handed WindmillThe next step up from Dirty Handed Willmill, the Free Handed variant requires a little run to build up momentum. The CKer will then launch themselves into the air with a jump and fully extend both legs out, whirling madly like a helicoptor rotor while moving forwards. The maximum distance this can cover is [Stamina/3] feet. The thing that makes this move so potent is the fact that, if a kick lands, it'll knock the victim back [user's Strength/2] feet and leave them rather winded. (Orientation does not matter)	35	28	12	0	22	14	0	0	0
970	7	7	Bloodstained Footsteps	Chimamire Kutsuoto	Whether bounding in the air or on the ground, the user is now completely fluid. It would take an extremely experienced opponent to be able to find an opening anywhere. The user now resembles the flow of water, constantly moving while leaving no gaps. Don't even think about taking the foot-fighter lightly here, because it would be the last mistake you ever made. At this level of mastery, they show the true, unleashed power of what the foot and leg can do when properly trained.Five directional changes are able to be made now. For example, a thrust can be smoothly transferred into an axe kick, which then becomes a sweep from the side. Changes can be made quickly enough to bypass blocks and leave an opponent bewildered about where the kick will come from. This works in mid-air too.	2	5	2	Moon KickThe user, when in close proximity with the target, back flips, landing a devastating blow to the target's chin, sending the opponent flying into the air (15 feet max). This does not apply to Human Tank archetypes. If Moon Kick is performed on a Human Tank, the HT target will only be lifted five feet, max. The user's strength must be higher than the target's stamina to raise him the full 15 feet. If not, divide the user's strength BY the target's stamina, then multiply the answer by 15. The final number is how many feet the target is propelled into the air. For Human Tanks, multiply the number by 5, instead of 15. Always round down. (Must be done facing the target)Pile DriverIf the target is airborne due to a previous attack from the user, the user will then leap into the air above the target, and axe-kick the target's sternum. Whether or not this misses, when the opponent lands on the ground, the user will then begin to fall, driving his knee down towards the target. (Orientation does not matter)	Drill KickWhat has been coined as the 'Rasengan of all Kicks', Drill Kick entails the user, as usual, starting themselves off with a leaping kick, feet first. Keeping the body rigid, he'll begin to spin rapidly like a drill. When hitting the opponent, all of that spin will be transferred to the opponent. Not only will they get knocked back a tremendous distance ([user's Strength x 2 in feet]), they'll be spinning uncontrollably through the air and even have a little 'shoe burn' from the intense friction of the user's feet drilling against the target's skin (like carpet burn). Drill Kick can only be performed [Stamina/10] times per thread. If the CKer's base Strength is at least 20 points higher than the victim's base Stamina, minor internal damage tends to be inflicted upon the target, similar to the actual Rasengan, albeit on a smaller scale. (Must be done facing the target)OOC:Obstacles will cut the victim's flight path short if they happen to hit a tree or something.Shadow KickRequirement: All previous special techs, including Drill Kick.Possibly the deadliest technique in a CKer's arsenal, Shadow Kick is the upgraded version of the Lion Kick. In the previous attack, the user had to run and build up speed. In the Shadow Kick, such momentum is not needed. He can simply launch himself from standstill, which catches many opponents off guard. Shadow Kick looks, in form, almost identical to Lion Kick, save for the fact that the user is trailing blurry afterimages, making it harder to determine how far he actually is when he seems to be shedding multiple skins. At this stage, the user can knock the opponent back 60 feet, no matter the target's weight or size, while the damage felt is 40 Strength. The maximum distance able to be leapt is 20 feet from standstill, or the full 40 Strength if at a run. Just as fatiguing, if not moreso than Lion Kick, Shadow Kick can only be performed [Stamina/10] times a thread. This move has been known to completely devastate the hardiest of foes, either by collapsing their chests from the might of the kick, or by blowing them back the full 60 feet, through trees, buildings, and so on. (Must be done facing the target)OOC:Should be known that in Lion Kick, obstacles will stop the victim's flight path. In Shadow Kick, he'll get knocked through those obstacles (unless it happens to be a strong metal or 'unbreakable').	40	30	29	0	28	16	0	0	0
969	1	1	Forbidden Sloth	Akazano Namakemono	The main focus upon this stage is introducing various simple submissions and a basic strategy for bringing fights to the ground. As far as submissions go the user is able to execute basic wrist locks, but the true combat finisher will be found within the rear naked and guillotine chokes which will remain the chokes of choice throughout the style. As far as takedowns go, the double leg takedown is a very easy to execute, but consequently easy to counter which makes the preferred takedown of choice for the budding practitioner the back trip. The problem with that being it's difficult to obtain the mount and get into the position to initiate it without the opponent noticing it.	4	2	3	Rear Naked Choke: The fact of the matter is that you're going to have to get behind the opponent to do this, either by catching him by surprise or by forcing yourself behind him. Once maintained though this choke is nearly impossible to escape from (unless Ninjutsu or Genjutsu is used or the opponents Taijutsu greatly overwhelms the users). From a standing position and behind your opponent the user will form his arm into a thin blade like shape and slip it underneath the jaw, do this until the elbow is right under the throat. At this point bring your supporting arm and grab your bicep and put your hand on the back of his head. This will make the choke tighter and if the opponent starts headbutting then you can stop him. At this point all you need to do is squeeze and pull back, this is a blood choke as it cuts off the blood directly to the opponents brain and forces them to either give up or get knocked out. Another tip is that once the choke is gotten to wrap your legs around your opponents waist, this allows him to not be able to squirm as much AND it allows you to utilize more of your torso in the pulling back, thus making the choke go by a lot quicker.Guillotine Choke: Pretty much what the RNC is for surprise attacks, the Guillotine is to defending against frontal attacks. Assuming someone comes at you low to the ground for a tackle, at this point you make your hand as thin as possible and slide it in between the jaw now grip your hand with your other hand and make sure you keep your arms close to your body so he cannot put his arm inside your arm. At this point simply fall back, this takes the fight to the ground, a.k.a. the home field. In order to prevent the opponent from somersaulting out of the move, you're going to wrap your legs around his waist to prevent an escape, remember to keep the legs tight as if you don't an opponent will simply move to the side to escape.The Double Legged Takedown: This move is simply a way to get the opponent on the floor and on their back, in which case a mount can be assumed and the ground and pound can ensue. The move's basis is shooting into the opponent's guard (a low forward dash) and grabbing their legs and simply rising up. While rising be sure to scoop their legs up, literally removing the ground from underneath then and sending them onto the floor. The end result? Their back slamming onto the ground and them being completely open for attacks from above.@The Back-Trip: The move's main basis if a counter for kicks or in later stages when in the clinch. Slipping a leg behind an opponents the user then simply pushes or punches the opponent. Any movement to send the opponent backwards, this causes them to trip on the foot placed behind them and at that point the result is the same as if they're being a victim of the double-legged. Meaning, they fall straight on their back.		4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
969	2	2	Forbidden Sloth	Akazano Namakemono	As stated above the practitioner at this stage shows a proficiency in executing the rear naked and guillotine chokes and also rudimentary take-downs, this causes the focus to switch to more joint based attacks, the star being the arm-bar in both it's flying and ground based variants. Takedowns remain more refined and a special emphasis on low shoot fighting in order to isolate legs and gain positions favorable for the back trip is introduced. Mentally the user is able to grasp the ideas for basic counters, but at the same time has a difficulty grasping things beyond the textbook counters; this of course is medicated with more combat experience.	4	2	3	Arm-Bar: With the opponent in your guard grab your opponent's triceps, with your opposite hand and pull it to the side across your body, making sure that the grip is extremely tight. At this point throw your right leg over your opponent's face while still marinating a grip on his triceps. Now grab the mount of your opponent's hand in order to have a strong control over his arm, while this control is being maintained simply pull at the arm and bend it straight up, the end result is either a broken arm or the opponent giving up. It's flying variant is in itself just an aerial rendition of the move, the benefits are obvious as you don't have to go to the ground to do it, but it does leave you open for your opponent to slam your head into whatever surface you're fighting on.		7	0	6	0	0	6	0	0	0
969	3	3	Forbidden Sloth	Akazano Namakemono	This stage shows a dramatic departure from the rest of the style as the basis is not in submissions, but rather in forming a standing game. At this point in the style the user has recognized and accepted that rarely will he have a fight start on the ground and rarely can he count on the opponent to allow themselves to be caught by a takedown. The purpose of this stage is the introduction of creating defensive stances -varying from user to user and moment to moment, though some obviously show a favor for one specific stance. The most consistent part is the introduction of the clinch which would serve as the basis for introducing throws and other trips that come into play in later stages, the clinch also allows for the rising knees that cause the styles striking game to be limited, but extremely devastating nonetheless.	4	2	3			10	0	10	0	0	8	0	0	0
969	4	4	Forbidden Sloth	Akazano Namakemono	At this point the user has grown skilled in their standing game to hold their own against opponents of a similar rank, though they're still far more comfortable with things on the ground. The answer in development is a simple one, more advanced ways to take the opponent down than pure punches and variants of the double legged and back trips. This is why throws become very important, literally making the opponent now a wall of possibilities and counters. Unfortunately at this stage in development, the user has merely mastered the theory of the takedowns and applying them in practice leaves for quite a lot of openings, at this moment though the user has mastered almost all of the rudimentary and intermediate aspects of the style. All that remains is refinement and mental defenses.	4	2	3			15	13	15	0	0	14	0	0	0
969	5	5	Forbidden Sloth	Akazano Namakemono	Everything the user has known has taken a great leap in efficiency and execution, the most important part of the practitioner at this stage is their ability to apply moves in unconventional ways. Countering a punch with a flying arm-bar, ducking underneath a spear user's spear in order to get them into a double legged takedown. The user is a thinker, the user is an excellent fighter, and most importantly their becoming shockingly more offensive. Against speedy attackers the user will usually stand still in a near perfect defensive shell simply waiting for an opponent to give them a limb, against bigger and stronger fighters they will end up climbing and scurrying on top of them in order to get them in the proper maneuver. The user has taken into consideration and has become skilled in all aspects of the style, but unfortunately still remains a jack of all trades, but master of none.	4	2	3			20	16	20	0	0	16	0	0	0
969	6	6	Forbidden Sloth	Akazano Namakemono	This stage focuses upon the idea that no matter how perfect your plan is, it will fail. At this point the user becomes adept at escaping reversals, countering counters, and even dueling against another master of this style with the ability to escape from submissions that prior to this would've been considered fight ending. Focusing more on the fact that the user's plans will fail this stage also take pride in conditioning at which point the nerves are deadened so much that the user can simply shrug off almost all the pain coming from strength attacks one level above their stamina, this is not to say that if they punch you in the ribs hard enough that they won't be broken, but just to say that your pain tolerance is enough for you to bear through it. The escaping aspect of the style finally becomes pivotal as the user now has the same amount of flexibility as a yoga practicioner and also the pain tolerance to compliment it. Paired up with the intense will to fight and knowledge of the human bone structure that has been trained throughout the style the user is even able to pop joints out of place and pop them back into place later for escapes.	4	2	3			25	25	25	18	0	18	0	0	0
969	7	7	Forbidden Sloth	Akazano Namakemono	At this stage the user has mastered every aspect of this style and is a wall of defensive countering force. The fact of the matter is that those fighting masters of the style (which usually have lean muscles rather than bulky) should instead focus on Genjutsu or Ninjutsu rather than Taijutsu. They don't leave any openings and they're perceptive enough to capitalize on any their opponents tend to give them. Those in the same area of a fight where a master of Forbidden Sloth are fighting usually think fireworks are going off, the sound of broken bones decorating the air.	4	2	3			33	33	33	22	0	22	0	0	0
968	1	1	Kyokogoma	None	At this level the user is only capable of basic kicks that require one foot to remain on the ground in order to maintain control. The user is physically capable of leaping kicks but such attacks are clumsy at best and easily avoided. The most common weakness in users at this level is their tendency to over extend their attacks and leave themselves open as a result. Defensive movements at this stage are slightly better than their offensive counter parts but even still a tendency toward over compensation makes counter attacks less effective than they could be with better control.	3	4	2	Snap Around At first glance this technique seems like a normal kick and indeed it starts out that way as the user does a round house style kick that ultimately ends with their back facing towards their intended target if the first kick lands then the user with immediately throw out a second either by kicking backwards or by spinning back around using the momentum to deliver a second attack. If the first kick misses then the user may hesitate a moment before unleashing their second attack, presumably to catch a target by surprise. The effectiveness of this technique as well as how advanced the follow up attack will be depends on the level of the user.		4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
968	2	2	Kyokogoma	None	Total Accumulated Bonuses: +8 Speed, +6 Strength, +4 StaminaStill only capable of basic kicks that require one foot on the ground the user has none the less become proficient enough in these attacks that they can use them effectively. The user can do leaps or flips for defensive purposes or attack positioning but these abilities are limited. Defensive movements have improved to the point that counter attacks against similarly skilled opponents are now possible and the user can now make some use of pushing or shoving movements to throw opponents off balance or keep opponents at a distance for kicking attacks.	3	4	2	Heaven Phoenix Kick To perform this technique a user will first deliver kick almost straight up while leaning their body back forming an almost Y or T like shape with their body and legs. As the user brings their foot down the body twists and the planted foot pivots so that the same leg comes around and over the user to do a dropping heel kick. There is almost no gap between the two movements and the move drives its name from the fact that a kick rises to the heavens, falls, and is reborn again as another attack, symbolizing a phoenix.		6	8	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
968	3	3	Kyokogoma	None	The user is now able to make limited use of leaping attacks and keeping at least one foot on the ground is no longer required. The primary differences between attacks at this stage and the previous one is that do to improved control and leaping ability the user has a much wider range of attacks to draw upon. Having not yet obtained more than a rudimentary mastery of leaping kicks the user is not able to perform moves that require dramatic hight or multiple rotations. Defensive gestures are improved to the point that the user is now capable of limited grabs that can be used to momentarily unbalance opponents more effectively than simple pushes.Note: Remember, grabs are still attacks and can be avoided or countered!	3	4	2	Swallow KickTo perform this technique a novice user requires at least some forward momentum but as the users skill increases they require increasingly less forward movement and then ultimately none at all. A fairly simple move in motion but more difficult in practice the move amounts to a forward flip with one leg extended in front with the other extended behind in a perfect 'splits' form. The purpose of the attack is to hit an opponent with the forward extended foot using the power behind the flip. The user will typically land in the 'splits' form with arms extended out to the sides slightly.		9	11	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
968	4	4	Kyokogoma	None	With an improved mastery of technique and body the user is now able to make much better use of leaping kicks. Improvements in power and accuracy along with increased speed allow the user to use attacks with greater height and rotation requirements. It is at this stage that the style begins to more accurately resemble the amazing series of kicks and flips for which it is known. Defensive gestures remain largely the same as before but allow the user to make limited use of grabs against incoming attacks as well as counter grabs against exposed areas on an attacker.	3	3	3	AscentWhen this technique is performed the user will kick off from a portion of their targets body, usually the thigh, and then almost literally climb up the targets body using using only the feet. Once the user has climbed up high enough to place one foot on the targets shoulder the user has several different options. The first and most common choice is to use the free foot to kick the opponent in the side of the head while leaping off but is almost possible to use both feet to leap off an opponents back. A more advanced form of this technique that can only be done by higher ranked users (5+) allows the user to turn around once they reach the targets shoulder and then come down facing the target from behind. With the more advanced version of the technique the user is able to grab the target by the head to force them down using weight and gravity or simply attack the targets legs from behind during the decent.		15	18	10	0	14	0	0	0	0
968	5	5	Kyokogoma	None	With improved power, technique and control the user is now able to make dramatic use of leaping kicks and will prefer them whenever possible. Now capable of incorporating all manner of leaps and spins in to attacks the users arsenal of basic attacks is almost fully developed and further training will primarily only improve what the user already knows while allowing for increasingly powerful attacks. Basic defensive movements are now completely perfected allowing the user to take better advantage of grabs and pushes for counter attacks. Grabs at this stage allow a user to knock an opponent down or to hold them momentarily for a kicking attack.	3	3	3	Heavenly AscentOften mistaken for 'Ascent' due to its similarity Heavenly Ascent is actually quite different. This move once again requires landing on an opponents shoulder but unlike Ascent this is done by leaping up and then landing directly on an opponents shoulder followed by the user leaping almost straight up. The force of the landing being followed almost immediately by the force of the jump will knock most opponents down or at least stagger them. After the jump the user will do a flipping turn before coming back down with a dropping heel kick on top of the target.		19	23	14	0	16	0	0	0	0
968	6	6	Kyokogoma	None	Near mastery of form and technique now permits the user virtually free range of movement through the air with only momentary contact required to change directions or maintain momentum. The primary advantage a user gains at this stage is the ability to execute new attacks in the air with the same force as attacks that first started on the ground. Normally when a user has executed one attack that brings them off the ground, as this style often does, subsequent attacks executed while still in the air will not be as effective but with this new level of mastery technique has improved to the point that this is no longer an issue. Pushes and especially grabs at this stage are now capable of sending opponents flying or crashing in to the ground and seem to come without warning.	3	3	3	Rising Storm KickThe Rising Storm Kick does not have a set series of movements and will differ from user to user in exact style and can even be different each time an individual user executes it. Regardless of the execution method and exact series of movements that follow it the idea behind the technique is to deliver a fast powerful kick to a targets chest or head powerful enough to lift the target off the ground. After the target is in the air the user launches a series of two or three spinning kicks aimed at the targets body which when combined with the force of the initial attack continue to move the target up at an angle before knocking them to the ground, usually with some type of top-down type attack.		25	29	20	0	20	16	0	0	0
968	7	7	Kyokogoma	None	The pinnacle of mastery or perhaps only the first step on the true road to mastery depending on whom you ask, this level is reserved for those who have dedicated much of their life to an art. With kicks that seem to come from nowhere and technique that pushes normal human limits the user now has the capacity to deliver blows from seemingly impossible angles and accomplish feats of aerial combat that defy belief. Counter attack movements such as grabs and pushes have reached a level that gives the user the ability to knock most opponents out of a fight by sending them to the ground with almost the same force as a well placed kick to the chest.	3	3	3	Crushing Spirit KickThis move is usually done from beside an opponent for maximum effect but it can be done from any direction and even if the user has their back to an opponent. Moving in a rapid blur a user will deliver a powerful spinning kick, usually to the back of a targets upper body this is followed instantly by another spinning kick to the front of a target, usually in the abdomen or chest. The resulting impact of these two kicks is harmful enough to a target but their effect is greatly increased by their 'opposing' force directed against the target from either side, crushing the target in the middle. Severe injury to internal organs and bones is not uncommon in targets of this technique and it must be used with caution as more than one use per day will result in serious injuries to the users legs.		33	37	28	0	24	20	0	0	0
967	1	1	Fool's Bane	Ahou no Ojike	Right now your goal is to understand. You see their eyes flicker to your torso, but what does it mean? Okay, so now you see them running towards you with a hand on the hilt of their sword; what do you do? Those questions may seem a bit idiotic, but you better form the habit of asking yourself what their answers are now, rather than later.Most of your work is done in a library or at the side of a training field. Your only task is to memorize what you read and see; know the human body and how it works, and how to disrupt that function. Seek out and observe spars between other people; you'll start to see how the other styles work. This knowledge is your friend. Right now, it's your only one.		4	5	Vital Strike: IchibanCarpe Jugulum. There are four points on the neck that you can aim for, but this technique focuses on the two on the outside of the neck; one on the left, one on the right (see figure 1). When you're being charged or attacked in any way that makes the opponent overextend their arm, it gives even you the opportunity to take them down. Continue the motion of their arm and their body will follow, giving you the perfect chance to strike either side of their neck with a hard chop with the side of your hand. A solid hit will knock a weak opponent out.Battle Analysis: In RetrospectÃ¢â‚¬Â¦It's not exactly a technique, but it'll be one of your most used skills. In retrospect, everything seems so much clearer. You see when you should have turned, you know when that block should have been executed, and it seems like every stutter in your opponent's movement screams what they're about to do next. The first in a line of Battle Analysis techniques, 'Retrospect' doesn't really do anything cool. You remember exactly, without fail, anything that happens in a battle you've observed (that includes the ones you actually participate inÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or I hope it does [please tell me you got that]) unless a genjutsu technique prevents you from doing such (in any case, you'd remember what happened while you were under the genjutsu).Pressure Point: EkikaThere is a pressure point underneath the arm that can hinder your opponent if hit correctly. The common technique to get at this point is ducking under a swing and striking with two fingers at the junction between the pectorals and the triceps. It's not quite the armpit, but it's close.Pressure Point: AshigatameLike Ekika or Ichiban, Ashigatame is a technique that requires you to grab your opponent's extended limb and pull. When a kick is aimed at an area above your hips, catch and pull the leg to put your opponent off balance and expose him at the same time. Any of the points on the leg are fair game for the two-finger strike.		0	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
967	2	2	Fool's Bane	Ahou no Ojike	At this point you should be able to tell if your opponent is left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous just by watching them execute a few blocks and attacks. It's also easier to apply that small piece of knowledge, now; aiming for their weak side will begin to happen without conscious thought.You're starting to experiment with attacks. Where before you were only able to intercept and deliver blows with your hands, you've started trying some fancy forearm blocks and even some leg work. It's nothing exceptional, but you've still managed to scrape up some more offensive moves.		4	5	Vital Strike: NibanThis is basically a slight adjustment of Ichiban. Instead of striking at your opponent's neck, you aim for their temples. It's easier to get a hit off if you're using the butt of your hand to strike, or sometimes, even your knuckles. Again, a solid hit can knock an opponent out.Battle Analysis: Do-Over!Like its precursor, this isn't exactly a technique. Using the knowledge you have of your previous opponent, you can make an often-time accurate guess what their reaction to you would have been if you changed one of your offensive or defensive move. Essentially, you take your memory of the battle and change one thing, and the rest of the battle changes accordingly. It doesn't change the real fight, but it allows you to get more of an insight into your opponent.Important! You cannot discover your opponent's range of techniques with this; you will only see them react with the jutsu that you've already seen them use, whether in combat with you or another. Thus, if you spar with someone a lot you'd be able to predict what they'd actually do more accurately than someone you'd only just met.Pressure Point: GekitsuuWhat better way to put pressure on an opponent then horrible pain? One of the 'forearm blocks' that was mentioned before, Gekitsuu involves only one arm. A punch or other arm strike is intercepted with the forearm, and from there the blocking arm is wrapped around the opponent's arm and twisted in a way that causes their arm to break. This is usually executed very quickly, as to provide force to actually break the bone, which you probably wouldn't otherwise have.Pressure Point: KutsuuA technique that doesn't really need to be taught, Kutsuu is, of course, the groin shot. Not a dirty hit by any means, the upward strike executed with your knee is actually aiming for a pressure point. Regardless of whether you believe me or not, you'll get a result out of either gender. One, however, tends to be more extreme.	Tabakaru: Super BasicAs if it's not already obvious enough, this passive technique allows the practitioner to know when they are under the influence of any stage one genjutsu.Important! Kai is still required to cancel out any of the genjutsu affects unless the specific genjutsu says otherwise. The user also cannot tell what genjutsu they are under or what the genjutsu is affecting any more than normal.	0	10	4	0	0	6	0	0	0
967	3	3	Fool's Bane	Ahou no Ojike	Well, would you look at that? Perhaps you may not be as weak as I made you out to be. Dodging has started to integrate itself into the style, although you should probably work on blocking more. A great number of your blocks can be turned easily into vicious attacks on the pressure points, although you're still not at the point where a hit can cause numbness. Decreased mobility can occur if more than one pressure point is hit, though, and if you're facing someone a good bit slower than you, you could put one of their arms out of commission.Mentally, you're now able to use the Battle Analysis from the previous stage to offer insights into your opponent's reactions to your moves during combat.		4	5	Vital Strike: SanbanIf you've seen boxing and think it's all fake, you obviously haven't studied hard enough. A hard punch under the chin can knock someone out for quite a bit, and even a botched hit can cause the opponent to become disoriented. Some prefer to use an upward elbow strike to hit the point, but any way you have of hitting it will get the relatively same reaction.Battle Analysis: Who Goes There?Sometimes looks can be deceiving, but this eliminates all uncertainty. You know that fun carnival game where a bored looking teenager tries to guess your weight and age? This is just like that, only not. You can now tell what rank your opponent is closest to being (i.e., a strong chuunin may end up being seen as a jounin) with just a glance, a useful technique when facing nin you've never encountered.Pressure Point: KokoronimonaiIt can't really be considered a pressure point attack at this point, but this is a sweep aimed at the opponent's legs. Whether you choose to hook your leg behind their knees or go for the ankles, you'll have your opponent on their back in no time. What you do after that is up to you.	Tabakaru: BasicPassive. Allows the user to know if they are under the influence of a stage two or lower genjutsu.GokanPrerequisites: Tabakaru: BasicPassive. Allows the user to know which of their senses, if any, are under the affect of a genjustu, regardless of what level genjutsu is being used on them.Important! This does not indicate what specifically in that sense is being affected.	0	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0
967	4	4	Fool's Bane	Ahou no Ojike	If your house is on fire, what do you take out first? This is the question all that make it this far are asked. It's the first taste the students get of prioritizing their problems, something that is very much a part of Ahou no Ojike from this point forwards.Now is when you start learning how to take on multiple opponents, and basically where you start sucking again. This style is one-on-one oriented, and when it because one-on-many, the practitioner will often become overwhelmed and have to flee. The focus now is distracting the weaker of your opponents and quickly dispatching the strongest, and repeating this cycle while taking the least amount of damage possible. Fakes are used to unbalance your foes, and keeping them constantly guessing by waiting longer and longer to counter is your friend.		4	5	Vital Strike: ShibanThe first of the vital strikes that has the potential to kill without the assistance of a blade, Shiban is the nose strike you've probably heard of. The butt of your palm is thrust up and at an angle at the opponent's nose, breaking it and possibly causing the bridge of the nose to puncture through to the brain, killing them.Battle Analysis: I Choose You!A technique that goes along with the newfound ability to battle multiple opponents, this allows the practitioner to single out the opponent that would be the hardest for them, with their specific abilities, to defeat.Pressure Point: MukankakuThe first time you'll ever be able to numb someone's limbs, Makankaku requires the majority (at least one over half) of the pressure points on an opponent's arm or leg to be hit (3 and 5, respectively). The limb in question will lose mobility and feeling, and will not be able to be used for two posts.	Tabakaru: IntermediatePassive. Allows the user to know if they are under the influence of a stage three or lower genjutsu.	14	15	14	0	0	14	0	0	0
967	5	5	Fool's Bane	Ahou no Ojike	The practitioners of Ahou no Ojike are starting to show individuality in their styles of attack. Those that aim to humiliate rather than harm tend to block less and dodge more, using their increased flexibility to dodge sometimes without moving their feet. Their counters take on a more disarming note, causing lasting soreness to remember lessons rather then quick and immediately harmful vital strikes to end a fight. Senseis tend to follow this route, but those that actually plan to use this style in a fight have taken on a more offensive approach, shutting down the enemy or enemies quickly and efficiently. The flexibility users have allow them to block and execute an attack even at odd angles that would cause others great discomfort with ease.		4	5	Battle Analysis: From Above!You're now becoming adept at keeping track of multiple opponents, and as such, it is now possible to use their attacks against each other. If you find yourself being attacked by multiple opponents in close quarters, you will realize when it's time to dodge out of the fray instead of blocking and letting their attacks run rampant on each other. With this comes the ability to sense where opponents that are engaged with you in battle are in relation to you.Pressure Point: Gobu MokankakuThe effects of Mokanakaku can now take hold with less pressure point hits. 2 hits are required for the arms, 3 hits are required for the legs.	Tabakaru: Advanced IntermediatePassive. Allows the user to know if they are under the influence of a stage four or lower genjutsu	18	20	18	0	0	16	0	0	0
967	6	6	Fool's Bane	Ahou no Ojike	Ichiban and Niban are now capable of killing an opponent if both pointsÃ¢â‚¬'the left and right side of the neck, and the left and right templeÃ¢â‚¬'are struck at maximum strength. The neck will shatter in the case of Ichiban, and Niban will send fragments of the skull into the brain. Ekika can now cause numbness and loss of use in the arm, for the amount of strikes Mokankaku requires has decreased to 1 for the arms and 2 for the legs. Kokoronimonai and Kutsuu can now be considered pressure point strikes that go towards Mokankaku, both counting towards both legs (i.e. using these two techniques would cause both of the legs to lose their mobility), as long as Kokoronimonai hits either the points on the back of the ankles or behind the knees.		4	5	Battle Analysis: I Spy, With My Little EyeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦It's always been easy for the practitioner to understand and guess the emotions of others accurately, but not there's a technique for it. Usable both out and in combat, this allows the practitioner to read the little signs that people give and interpret them to know what they're feeling. If you're even a little bit afraid of losing the battle, they'll know, and they won't hesitate to exploit it.		23	29	23	18	0	18	0	0	0
967	7	7	Fool's Bane	Ahou no Ojike	It isn't likely that you'd find someone that made it to this point without dying, but if you were to, you'd be shocked if you were able to see even a small window of their repertoire of knowledge. It isn't unlikely to find those that are this far into the style in positions of power, surrounded by an extensive web of informants that feed them information about anything and everything. Practitioners of other styles find themselves struggling against both their surroundings and their opponents in enemy territory, at a disadvantage because they don't know all the locals do. Those that practice Ahou no Ojike find themselves never in such a position, knowing their surroundings intimately no matter where they find themselves.Truly masters of all things tactical, it's extremely difficult to get a leg up on those rare few that have reached this level. Every step they take is calculated, every step their opponent takes has already been planned for. If you're feeling confident that you're winning, there's probably something you missed.The movements of Ahou no Ojike aren't graceful and dancelike, they're lightning fast and devastating. It's not odd to see that the user didn't move at all from the beginning of the fight to the closure, for one hit can be all it takes for the fight to end. Even when an overextended limb is grasped in preparation for a strike, serious bruising or even bone fractures can take place. Genjutsu users are in for a nasty surprise if they encounter a user of this level, and even close combat taijutsu users will struggle through a fight with them.		4	5			33	36	30	22	0	22	0	0	0
966	1	1	Initial Gate	Kai-Mon	1 to all Taijutsu levels  Opening Kai-Mon will remove the brain's built-in inhibitors that prevent the body's muscles from exerting their full force. These inhibitors, however, are in place for good reason. They also prevent the muscles from literally tearing themselves apart through overuse. However, there may come a time when a person is willing to risk their body for some cause, and the temporary increase in power that comes as a result of full use of the muscles may be their only option.	0	0	0	Ability: Quick Start - With the limits on the user's muscles taken away, the initial gate allows the user to move to their full acceleration without concern for their body. This doesn't make them any faster, but can make them hard to follow.  Techniques: Kai-mon techniques focus on strength. With the initial gate allowing the user to flex the full natural capability of their muscles, ignoring their limits, these techniques usually cause a great deal of strain to the body. The attack performs one great feat of strength that can be followed by smaller attacks		4		4						
966	2	2	Healing Gate	Kyu-Mon	1 to all Taijutsu levels (Not cumulative)  Kyu-Mon is an important part of the gates, as it helps in the user's tolerance of gate use. When this gate is opened, it forcibly restores a great amount of energy within the body, giving more stamina. This ability chiefly comes into play later. As the user's body becomes more accustomed to opening gates, this gate allows them to do so safely, as Kyu-mon helps to ease the burden that other gates place on the body.	0	0	0	Ability: Rejuvenation - Kyu-mon increases the body's natural rate of rejuvenation. It creates a burst of stamina by quickly replenishing the rate that the body repairs cell damage. Immediately, upon being opened, small damage, scrapes and cuts are closed as a side effect. The body also feels renewed, and any fatigue is instantly wiped away.  Techniques: Similar to the gate techniques of Kai-mon gate, the Kyu-mon relies on one burst of strength that pushes the body to the limit. The difference is that Kyu-mon resets the body before the techniques are used, allowing more daring and dangerous combinations. 		6		8		6				
966	3	3	Life Gate	Sei-Mon	2 to all Taijutsu levels (Not cumulative)  Sei-Mon restricts the flow of the chakra from user's core. By releasing this gate the massive increase in chakra increases strength and movement while also heightening their senses and reaction time. The user's skin turns red as the flow of blood and chakra is increased to a dangerous level. The eyes dilate, and the skin becomes sensitive to the touch. On top of this, a green aura of energy erupts around them, the chakra pouring from their tenketsu enough to cause a visual change in the air.				Ability: Agitated Synapses - Sei-mon is the first gate along the spinal cord, and opening it unleashes more chakra through parts of the body that control sensory input. Because of this, having the third gate open gives a unique benefit, increased sense speed. Fast objects, like enemies moving extremely fast, projectiles in the air, or similar, can be tracked better. The direction of the wind, the taste of sweat in the air, the smell of fresh cut grass, are all read faster than previously possible.  Techniques: Gate techniques after Sei-mon is open can take advantage of the increased accuracy of their senses to perform attacks in quick succession that require specific movements. While a strong blow and a grab isn't that difficult, grabbing specific limbs in succession, or striking specific places on a moving target, are helped by the use of the gate of life being open.		8		12		8				
966	4	4	Pain Gate	Sho-Mon	3 to all Taijutsu levels (Not cumulative)  Sho-Mon is the crucial gate when it comes controlling the amount on pain the body feels, what makes the body feel good and what causes the pain. Releasing this gate completely disables the user's pain receptors thus making him immune to all pain -and most other sensation. This creates a real risk of ripping muscles with use, even without using gate techniques or other risky manueuvers.  Ability: Reduced Pain Reception - Sho-mon's control of the sense of pain turns off the user's response to pain for as long as they have the gates open. While they are aware of their body's movements, a small scrape and a mortal gash both no longer matter to the user. A key benefit is that outside of the physical force of blows, the user will not be stunned by attacks.  Techniques: After Sho-mon, gate techniques take on a new level of recklessness. The user knows they are ripping their muscles as they use them, but the pain is gone, and therefore the reluctance to push to the limit is removed. The pain gate opens up wild combinations, attacks that put the user's own body front and center as the projectile, and others that would be too dangerous for someone who could feel their own body falling apart.

966	5	5	Limit Gate	To-Mon	3 to all Taijutsu levels (Not cumulative)  This gate restricts the muscles from using their maximum power and prevents them from being sprained. The body does not use the full potential of muscles to prevent reduce the risk of them getting strained or deteriorated through reckless or abusive use. Combined with Kyu-Mon, this gate really helps give extra control when using the celestial gates. 				Ability: Clinging Speed - The bursts of speed capable with the opening of To-mon make it possible to press the attack at the risk of personal health. With To-mon (and opponent's permission), offensive special techniques from taijutsu styles can be used in succession in the same post (two special techniques). This allows a lot of damage to be laid down on opponents in a short amount of time.  Techniques: With To-mon, gate techniques don't change much from their previous form. One difference is that these attacks are more likely to ignore or shrug off the actions of the opponent. Not that it provides resistance to damage, it just becomes more common to attack into a blow, or continue to attack through a counter-attack.		18	15	23		16				
966	6	6	View Gate	Kei-Mon	4 to all Taijutsu levels (Not cumulative)  Kei-mon's location in the chain of gates means it opens massive stores of chakra within the body. With it released, the body begins to pour large amount of chakra into the air, causing small vortexes of chakra with their every movement, and even shifting the landscape even while they are standing still. Kei-mon being open allows for instinctual manipulation of the out-poured chakra for powerful attacks that go beyond the physical.				Ability: Excessive Energy - Kei-mon raises the chakra burned off to such a dangerous level that small vortexes of chakra form on their every movement. This can make even weak strikes give off a splash of power on impact that will crumple defenses. Every physical attack also counts as a chakra attack while this gate is open. This means taijutsu strikes count as ninjutsu of stage six, and defensive techniques are destroyed on the greater of that stage or whatever stat would break it.  Techniques: The most distinct part of gate techniques with Kei-mon is that their every action leaves a lasting trail of chakra. Gate techniques in this stage may even use the aftermath of chakra from attacks to perform physical blows without physically touching, or leave the target enveloped in a mass of expelled chakra. 		25	20	30		19	17			
966	7	7	Wonder Gate	Kyo-Mon	4 to all Taijutsu levels (Not cumulative)  After Kyo-mon is open the body lets out truly enormous power. All chakra, except that required to keep living, is being released from the body, causing even the sweat that leaves their body to burn as a blue aura. The only limit left is Shi-mon, so the body surpasses all other limits that would preserve its own life. Even the slightest contact now is enough to make the gate user's muscles burst.				Ability: Minute to Midnight - Kyo-mon is the final barrier before the gate to the heart. Opening that door gives a burst of strength that surpasses common limits. For Jounin that use Kyo-mon, their scaling moves to Sennin scale.  Techniques: At the point of Kyo-mon, the line between taijutsu and ninjutsu begins to blur. Gate Techniques allow the blending of the mass of secreted chakra, and physical movements, to blast opponents with all manner of powerful attacks. The names of mythical techniques start to become literal, as the user's essential chakras answer to the call, and take the proper shape to save the day.		35	25	39		24	20			
966	8	8	Death Gate	Shi-Mon	Shi-mon controls the chakra to the heart and soul, the final gate that insures survival. When Shi-mon is opened, it requires a special maneuver that directly pierces the heart. After the gate is unleashed, there is no going back. After this gate is closed, the last chakra within their body will escape and they will expire. Even if somehow they are physically saved from death, their body will never recover. The furnace within them has been snuffed, and the light within would have to be a new one, a weaker one. Their muscles, organs, body, has baked itself from the intense heat unleashed inside and out. Shi-mon gives a new aura, the intense heat released from their body mixing with the blood to create a dark red aura that envelops them, making even their presence deadly to weaker enemies.				Ability: The End - There is no other strength after the Death Gate, every ounce of power has been given. For this reason, the Death Gate pushes the user to the highest point of taijutsu scaling, and nothing can move them lower. Even when 'slowed', that is relative to the amount of speed and power they are giving with every action.  Techniques: The user's aura itself is now dangerous. The lifeblood chakra spilling from their body is volatile to everyone and everything around them, making techniques able to completely shred enemies just with proximity. Physical blows are earth shattering, god-killing, and life-ending for all parties involved.		0	0	0	0	0	0			
947	1	1	Sakata-Ryu Kenjutsu	None	At this stage, the swordsman learns the basic attack routines and striking patterns of the style. Due to the nature of the style, combinations are not favoured over single, powerful blows. The users speed increases as he begins to learn the stepping method of the style, though he is generally limited in how well he can shift his direction and focus, putting him at a severe disadvantage against multiple foes. It is important to note that this style is completely ground-based; while a Sakata might use any sort of acrobatics that he is capable of to avoid an incoming strike, no leaping attacks are taught, for the base of the user's power comes from having a solid stance on the ground.	2	5	2			0	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
947	2	2	Sakata-Ryu Kenjutsu	None	At this stage, the basic attack routines are mastered, and the student begins to learn more advanced attack patterns, such as retreating strikes, striking during a sidestep, and very basic combinations (that essentially amount to a feignt followed by a powerful strike.) Constant practice has toned the student's muscles, increasing the power of his strikes, and familiarity with the intricate stepping method of the style has increased his combat movement speed by a respectable amount. It is at this stage that the student begins to practice shifting his attention from one opponent to another in the middle of a battle, and by learning this stage he is proficient in dealing with two opponents as easily as he could deal with one.	2	5	2			0	11	3	0	6	0	0	0	0
947	3	3	Sakata-Ryu Kenjutsu	None	At this stage, the student has become adept at using advanced attack routines. No new attack patterns are learned, as this stage of the training places emphasis on other areas. The student's strength has become considerable thanks to countless hours repeating the same strikes over and over with the aid of a weighted bokken, but the true emphasis of this stage is on engaging multiple opponents and the user's own combat speed. True to its reputation as a style that emphasizes the quick kill, students at this stage learn to move short distances at an amazing speed. These movements are always accompanied by a strike; whose normal power is increased greatly by the speed of the strike. In the area of fighting multiple opponents, the student begins to learn how to avoid being surrounded, by using opponents as visual blocks and obstructions against other opponents. The student, now adept at the style, can battle four opponents without too much of a disadvange.	2	5	2	Regular Technique: Steel FlickerDescription: The Steel Flicker is the name given to the Sakata-ryu user's ability to cover short distances in between breaths and strike. This technique has given rise to a Sakata Mantra; "Inhale, Kill, Exhale." At this stage, the user can dash 3 meters, and this movement must always be followed by a strike.		0	15	5	0	8	0	0	0	0
947	4	4	Sakata-Ryu Kenjutsu	None	At this stage, a new set of attack patterns are learned as the student adds thrusting and stabbing into his repetoire of moves that had, to this point, only included various slashing strikes. The use of an even heavier weighted bokken (which at this point is more of a wooden handle attached to a block of wood) has increased the student's strength even further, and constant practice has given a brutal grace to his strikes, which now occur at an extreme speed. The student can now cover more ground with his dashing strikes, leading some detractors of the style to comment on its use as an assassin's style more than a swordsman's. Rigorous training, at this point, has increased the swordsman's speed, even when he is not executing an attack, though by far his greatest speed still occurs prior to a strike.	2	5	2	Regular Technique: Steel FlickerDescription: The Steel Flicker is the name given to the Sakata-ryu user's ability to cover short distances in between breaths and strike. This technique has given rise to a Sakata Mantra; "Inhale, Kill, Exhale." At this stage, the user can dash 4 meters, and this movement must always be followed by a strike.		8	22	13	0	14	0	0	0	0
947	5	5	Sakata-Ryu Kenjutsu	None	Description: A refinement of stage 4.	2	5	2	Regular Technique: Steel FlickerDescription: The Steel Flicker is the name given to the Sakata-ryu user's ability to cover short distances in between breaths and strike.

947	6	6	Sakata-Ryu Kenjutsu	None	Description: A refinement of stage 5.	2	5	2	Regular Technique: Steel FlickerDescription: The Steel Flicker is the name given to the Sakata-ryu user's ability to cover short distances in between breaths and strike. This technique has given rise to a Sakata Mantra; "Inhale, Kill, Exhale." At this stage, the user can dash 8 meters, and this movement must always be followed by a strike.		20	30	25	0	20	16	0	0	0
947	7	7	Sakata-Ryu Kenjutsu	None	Description: Mastery of Sakata-ryu Kenjutsu is achieved at this stage. All of the previously learned attack patterns and tactics can now be executed flawlessly and without thought. The master can cover quite a bit of ground when executing a dashing attack, and there is little doubt that its use at this stage is an assassination technique used to kill an opponent before he has a chance to defend himself (though it can be used in the middle of a battle as an unexpected and powerful strike.) A veteran of many battles, the master can engage any number of opponents at a time (partly due to skill, and partly due to the fact that beyond a certain number, such opponents would only hinder one another.)	2	5	2	Regular Technique: Steel FlickerDescription: The Steel Flicker is the name given to the Sakata-ryu user's ability to cover short distances in between breaths and strike. This technique has given rise to a Sakata Mantra; "Inhale, Kill, Exhale." At this stage, the user can dash 12 meters, and this movement must always be followed by a strike.		23	40	36	0	24	20	0	0	0
946	1	1	Dance of the Waves	Harou no Mai	The user is at the most basic level in terms of speed, stamina, and strength. Though a bit faster and stronger than most other shinobi at the same level, it is nothing amazing. The most the user can do at the moment is just swing his blade(s) around and wiggle their hips a little.	3	4	2	Courtier's Small MannersThe user is able to move just enough to make any strike of equal stage graze instead of directly hit.		0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
946	2	2	Dance of the Waves	Harou no Mai	The user now has the basic rudiments of the style down. Capable of basic strikes, the user can inflict some damage, but usually nothing incredibly serious (except done by accident). Speed has increased, considerably. The strength has increased as well, but not by much. The user is also capable of some decently graceful moves at this point.	3	4	2	Gentle Touch of the LoverThe user can stab once and land a hit in such a way that their opponent doesn't feel it or it feels like a soft touch and not a stab. Due to it's deceptive nature it doesn't stab far and thus doesn't deal much damage.		6	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
946	3	3	Dance of the Waves	Harou no Mai	Speed has increased, considerably again. The strength has increased as well, but not by much. The user is also capable of some very graceful moves at this point. They could, if they wanted to, entertain a small crowd of people with their dance all though it's not mesmerizing.	3	4	2	Fluttering EyesThe user spins their blade(s) around them in a very fast so that when it's in front of their face it looks like they're fluttering their eyes at someone. However, this is actually a defensive technique that when infused with chakra can block many projectile attacks and Taijutsu attacks as well.		9	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
946	4	4	Dance of the Waves	Harou no Mai	The user can now hold his own in a swordfight, although against a higher-level shinobi he would go down easily. The speed and strength of the user has increased slightly, but in such a way that now movements are much more efficient, with less wasteful moves. The user's reaction speed is now more noticeable, allowing the user to dodge and move in a way that is much more effective then before.	3	4	2			13	18	12	0	0	0	0	0	0
946	5	5	Dance of the Waves	Harou no Mai	The blade is now an extension of the body, something that the user can use like an arm or a leg. Their use of the blade in the dance has truly becoming stunning now. Speed and power hasn't increased much, but it seems as if it has because of the application of the dance. The reaction time of the user, has increased again, allowing the user to see and react reflexively to most attacks below his skill level.	3	4	2	Caress of 1,000 ConcubinesThis attack uses many stabs and slices at the opponent. There are so many and they are delivered in such a way that when hit the actual impact feels more like the touch of a lover than a blade piercing flesh. The opponent is not actually hit 1,000 times but is hit so many times that the actual number has never been counted. Just like Gentle Touch each strike lacks any serious damage.		18	21	17	0	0	0	0	0	0
946	6	6	Dance of the Waves	Harou no Mai	The speed of the user rises dramatically, and is so fast that normal people can barely keep track unless the user so desires them to. The strength of the user is now at it's limits. Nothing can stop the blade of the user, except for a very few jutsu, weapons, and ninja. Normal steel can be cut through easily. The strength of the user, though, is not used fully correctly, wasting some effort and movement to access the strength of the user.	3	4	2	Flurry of the Cherry BlossomsIn a lunging flurry of attacking the user concentrates on distraction and flurry more than actually landing a hit. Opponents that have survived this technique describe what appears Cherry Blossoms falling to the ground behind the user, that is where this technique's name comes from.		25	27	23	17	0	0	0	0	0
946	7	7	Dance of the Waves	Harou no Mai	The weapons are more then extensions of the body now. The blades are the body. The pure grace and skill within the user is so high that it can only be described as awe-inspiring. It is this stage the greatest dancers have achieved. This is the stage that dancers that are remembered for a generation or two after their death are at.	3	4	2	Invoking the Chimera's CoilsThe user moves their sword in a continual backward motion never bringing it forward in a threatening manner. Then when it is least expected the user lunges their sword(s) forward stabbing directly at their opponent.		34	35	30	20	0	0	0	0	0
945	1	1	Eclipse	Kaiki	Taijutsu:Here, there should be next to no development of combat skill. As one of the basic stepping stone's of the style, the taijutsu development is more concerned with physical conditioning and stable foot work more than actual fighting. Never the less, the basics of kicking and punching are taught should someone at this level have no choice but to fight.Swordplay:Much like the taijutsu training above this stage is only concerned with the basic ground work. Users are taught how to hold their weapons and a few basic attack and defence patterns but beyond that there is nothing here to comment on.Perception:At this level the user doesn't even know where his body is. Never mind his opponents.Misdirection:Without an understanding of your opponent and the knowledge of your own body the user literally cannot be taught the foundations of misdirection at this level.	3	4	2			0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
945	2	2	Eclipse	Kaiki	Taijutsu:Now with a solid understanding of the basic combat patterns and styles available to them the user begins to refine their overall knowledge of the human body and its capabilities. They are introduced into the different methods of attack they are capable of performing and how to perform them at least reasonably well - from the simplest headbutt to a strong straight punch.Swordplay:Now familiar with their weapon of choice, the user must begin the arduous task of learning its capabilities. Defensive training is stressed here and the fundamental stances of defence are taught to ensure they have a chance of protecting themselves against the nine striking points of the sword. Work on fencing patterns is also begun - both for fighting other weapon users and other taijutsu fighters.Perception:The beginnings of perception training are finally evident in the daily routines of the practitioner. Here, begins the long road to honing the reflexes in the human body to react instinctively to the slightest sign of danger - be the user willing or not - and to facilitate this a student is also beginning to learn the angles at which he can be assaulted and the best methods to defend himself against numerous types of attack.Misdirection:Because of their basic ground in the human body's natural desire to avoid danger and what little knowledge they have on this subject the users begin to understand the first principle of the kaiki. If you hold a weapon it is the weapon your enemy will focus upon. Using your weapon, strike with the intention of drawing your enemy's guard away and follow with an attack from your body.	3	4	2			0	7	7	0	6	0	0	0	0
945	3	3	Eclipse	Kaiki	Taijutsu:The user now has the basics well and truly out of the way. However, there is still a long way to go before they could be called a master of their art. It is here however that the individual practitioners begin to drift towards an individual style of combat. As such, it's common see two students spar against each other with completely different moves depending on what path they've taken.Swordplay:Again, the basics are now well and truly out of the way and the basic patterns are refined and may be executed by memory with the slightest provocation. User's are even more likely to develop differences here than in even the taijutsu training as the weapon more readily reflects a person's personality than their body alone would suggest.Perception:Reflexively reacting to any attack directed towards their vitals has become almost second nature to the user now. Their speed training also certainly pays off in this department and many users of Kaiki are able to defend themselves far more readily than someone of comparable skill. Along with this reflexive training most users are also taught the fundamentals of reading body language at this stage as well.Misdirection:Body language - the tell tale signs of a person's next move - is the same across all styles no matter there focus or their speciality. Every action is preceded by the slightest notion of a person's next stroke. With this in mind the Kaiki seeks to abolish this handicap by forcing the body to change its natural ways. Though at this stage this is only the basics of such a notion the simple fact that the user's body does not move the way it is supposed to can cause confusion in even seasoned veterans.	3	4	2			0	10	10	0	8	0	0	0	0
945	4	4	Eclipse	Kaiki	Taijutsu:The divergence between practitioners is crystal clear now. Most members of the kaiki will now be practicing different versions of the same style. At this level their skill has also become more than admirable with every part of the body capable of being a weapon in a pinch, a grace that only comes with experience, and toned physique from years of hard practice.Swordplay:With the body focusing on its offensive capabilities the weapon turns fully to the defence of its user. How to protect themselves from any direction with their blades becomes a hard sought skill for those who make it this far into their training. Though no new offensive patterns are specifically learned here the older techniques are kept sharp should the need to use them arrive.Perception:It is here that all the reflex training in the previous levels of the Kaiki is destroyed. Users are beaten until they learn not to react to every attack, and to never react in the easiest possible way to any attack they choose to dodge. Instead, they are taught to become calculating - always dodging just enough in the hardest way they can so an opponent can never use his experience to help in a fight. Naturally, the body language training has progressed in an equal manner and all of the basic patterns of movement have been memorized - though acting upon that movement is still nearly impossible for anything but cold, hard reflexes and a bit of guess work.Misdirection:The technique of using their body language to appear to move in one direction before going in another has been mastered more or less. To those that rely of such subtle clues for aid this is absolutely devastating - but for others it merely becomes a hair's breadth of difference between the two fighters though in many cases that's all that one needs to size victory.	3	4	2			13	16	14	0	14	0	0	0	0
945	5	5	Eclipse	Kaiki	Taijutsu:Powerful and exceedingly fast, user's at this stage are conditioned to end the fight in a brutal, destructive manner using whatever techniques they've trained themselves to use. Be they subtle or powerful in nature, practitioners of the Kaiki are a torrent to behold as they strike and overpower those they face. They are also well aware of their lack of stamina compared to many people and because of this they tend to fight in bursts of activity - moving in to test their opponents defences before moving out again.Swordplay:Moves are sharp and efficient - the user having turned their defences and their attacks through experience. At a moments notice their weapon can be on guard or striking out along with their bodies as needed. Truly, they are impressive fighters with an understanding of their weapons that only a swordfighter of equal skill could match.Perception:The ability to accurately perceive body language continues to refine, but another sense begins to develop in a similar manner. Emotions of the subtle flow of a person's chakra can often say more about where someone is going to be than through their movements alone. Where an opponent directs their energy, and how their body responds in kind become two sides of the same coin - and with the ability to read both becoming more apparent a Kaiki user can start to fathom what their enemy is about to do with frightening accuracy.Misdirection:Much like the perception training, the fundamental basics of the misdirection training is at its limit. What the user decides to do now is completely up to them. Some choose to employ techniques to move their chakra and direct their emotions much like they've done body language in the past. Still others take a more exotic approach to misdirection and delve into things such as hypnosis but the result is the same - it has become neigh impossible to predict the Kaiki's next motion before it happens.	3	4	2			17	20	18	0	16	0	0	0	0
945	6	6	Eclipse	Kaiki	Taijutsu:Almost perfect in their form and movements at this stage it has become readily apparent that the Kaiki cannot take the punishment that many other styles can receive or dish back in return. To this effect, many users have mastered the ability to incorporate skirmishing tactics - usually employed by missile troops - into their fighting styles; strike harder and faster than they can to destroy them utterly before retreating to leave their enemies in disordered panic. Even without the option of these tactics though they are still masters of hand-to-hand fighting and are more than capable of tearing through lesser men with frightening ease on brute strength and sheer speed alone.Swordplay:Refined almost to the point of perfection, the defensive aspect of the Kaiki is from here on out considered to be mastered. They are more than capable of reacting gracefully to any assault their enemy can throw at them through a combination of raw technique and a subtle reading of their opponent's moves. Therefore, it is at this stage that offensive training has begun full force. Their duelling skills and offensive swordplay advance at a frightening pace and coupled with their taijutsu they are capable of mounting a vicious, unsurvivable attack.Perception:It is here that the ability to perceive an opponent is mastered. Subconsciously, a practitioner of the Kaiki knows exactly what his opponent is going to do a fraction before he starts to do it. Realistically, their conscious reaction to such information is far slower than that godlike reasoning ability, but the skill is there and their ability to enhance their perception skills cannot go any higher.Misdirection:Much like the perception training, the ability to cover their own movements has reached the absolute limit of the human body. It has become impossible to read their moves at this stage and not even a supreme master could see what they're about to do before their body is already full into the motion.	3	4	2			22	30	23	0	20	16	0	0	0
945	7	7	Eclipse	Kaiki	Taijutsu:The only word to describe the level of skill attained here would be sheer terror. In the few minuets they are capable of acting at full capacity they're more than capable of tearing asunder the lives of all who dare oppose them. A true tornado of destruction their skills are only matched by those of likewise mastery. A simple kick can snap with such speed as to be all but unblockable and with its momentum and the raw power behind it such a motion could rip a man in half.Swordplay:Though seemingly harmless compared to the fury their body is capable of inflicting, their weapons have been far from forgotten. The defence is almost perfect, their ability to instantly go to an offence all but un matched - and even when faced with a punch that could blow a two foot hole in your chest do not forget the darting steel out of the corner of your eye - as all it takes is one cut to decapitate.Perception:While the art of perceiving itself cannot be enhanced any further the user's ability to process and react upon the information he receives can improve. They are capable of literally using every trick in the book to read their opponents and they have become neigh perfect at this level. Even when faced with a faster foe the fractions of a second they gain from this phenomenal insight is more than capable of tipping the balance in their favour.Misdirection:Likewise, the art of hiding your own actions cannot be improved but there is one more method a master can use. At this stage they can literally influence their opponents ever so slightly into a more desirable course of action. They may only shift their movements a few centimetres out or pause for less than a breath but the control is their. Subtle and more dangerous than anyone can imagine, this little advantage is more important than anything at such a level - where even the slightest deviation from a technique can be disastrous.	3	4	2			33	35	31	0	26	18	0	0	0
944	1	1	Instant Death	Sokushi	At this stage of the Taijutsu style, the fundamentals are drilled:-Know your surroundings.-Never expect a fair fight.-Always play to your advantage.-The honour of a victory is decided by the victor - the dead have no prize.Ambush and assassination tactics are taught to the disciples of the style, including a variety of ways to entice victims into lower their guard, such as pretending to be a wounded civilian. However they are far too unskilled to put what they have learnt into practice yet.		5	4	Regular Technique - Sekken [Sweeping conquest]This is a simple method that is taught to all users of the style, in order for them to maximise the power of their blows. They are taught to put their momentum into their strikes, not only to use charging or high speed attacks, but to pivot on the spot to spin and put their speed into an attack.At first this skill is nothing to be concerned about, however at higher levels of the style, practitioners can go so far as to rotate in an instant, putting their full momentum into an attack. The obvious downside to too much spinning is that you leave your back open for a moment, the other options, such as charging or simply moving at high speed, do not have this downside.		0	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
944	2	2	Instant Death	Sokushi	The theory which has been drilled in the previous teachings of the style is now put into practice, mock assassination and ambush drills are the primary method of training, focusing on speed and surprise.At this stage, the introduction of how to deal with multiple opponents arises, as often prospective victims will not travel alone. With the current level of proficiency, the user could still only fight one on one.		5	4	Regular Technique -Aibu [Caress]Although this technique is most frequently used by those carrying some sort of bladed weapon, there are those that do not. It is also important that you never be without options in a fight, Aibu is a technique that maximises the chance of decisive killing blows. Although it is often used to beat simply beat an opponent to a pulp.Aibu is a method to strike a victim twice with one blow. The user doesn't fully clench their fist when they strike, instead hitting the victim with an initial blow from the joints on the middle of their fingers, followed by the remainder of their fist.		0	11	3	6	0	0	0	0	0
944	3	3	Instant Death	Sokushi	The deadly strikes that form the backbone of the style are mastered, in practice at least. Disciples of the style are well versed in ambush and assassination techniques, and are able to engage in combat with two opponents unhindered.The limitation of the style begins here, that the users cannot progress without actual combat experience. Because of this, live combat drills are the main form of training as well as actual combat missions, due to this, there is a high 'drop-out' rate at this stage.		5	4	Regular Technique -Hissatsu [Certain Kill]The user launches themselves at an opponent, going from a standstill to their maximum speed, to quickly strike at an enemy. The technique is used as a one hit kill method of assassination, with the target typically being impaled through the throat or heart if it hits cleanly.Limitations:- The skill has an effective range of nine feet, three times the users level of proficiency in the style.- Using this skill once a day without problem.- Using the skill a second time causes the user's body to give way, resulting in being unable to move normally for one post, you could still roll out of the way of an attack, but that is as agile as you'll get.- Using the skill a third time causes fractures to the users leg bones. This causes the users speed to be halved until medical attention is sought.- Using the skill a fourth time [which ignores the halved speed penalty of your legs] results in you being crippled until medical attention is received. At best you could crawl away from a fight after this, your legs couldn't support a grasshopper.		0	14	6	8	0	0	0	0	0
944	4	4	Instant Death	Sokushi	At this stage, those training in the technique are set to work on refining what they have learnt through live exercises, on living targets, primarily gangs of thugs or low level targets. By doing this, the users get a feel for combat, and learn how to deal with fighting groups of three people at once.		5	4	Regular Technique -Aibu [Caress]Although this technique is most frequently used by those carrying some sort of bladed weapon, there are those that do not. It is also important that you never be without options in a fight, Aibu is a technique that maximises the chance of decisive killing blows. Although it is often used to beat simply beat an opponent to a pulp.At this stage a practitioner of this style has enough speed and skill to deliver two punches in rapid succession, a split second slower than it would take them to deliver one punch. Needless to say, if the first hit lands, the second is assured to, which effectively doubles the suffering of the victim.		10	18	15	14	0	0	0	0	0
944	5	5	Instant Death	Sokushi	After gaining sufficient combat experience, users of the Sokushi style are allowed to progress to further levels of training, during which they are able to put their experience to use with the theory they learn.They are instructed on the proper application of the Hissatsu technique, as well as being encouraged to spar with multiple users of the same rank. This gives the shinobi a furthered understanding of frenzied, melee type combat, and most at this rank are able to fight with up to four opponents simultaneously.		5	4	Regular Technique -Hissatsu [Certain Kill]The user launches themselves at an opponent, going from a standstill to their maximum speed, to quickly strike at an enemy.

944	6	6	Instant Death	Sokushi	By this point, assassination and ambush methods are mastered. The speed which dominates the style is focused on throughout this level of development, as a master of one hit kills is trained to deliver them at ever decreasing intervals.Due to the focus on increasing the speed of the shinobi, no further training is given in engaging multiple opponents, however what they have learnt already is reinforced.		5	4			18	35	22	26	10	0	0	0	0

943	1	1	Sleeping Blue Dragon 	Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu	Stances: Though Iaijutsu kenshi nearly always initiate an attack with the sword drawn, inevitable encounters against well trained enemies mean that dueling will occur. In these situations, kenshi revert to Kenjutsu. As such, it is important for kenshi to know the four basic stances used in dueling. In all cases, the katana is gripped the same, using the V formed by the thumb and second finger to line up with the back of the blade. Unlike in other Taijutsu styles, stances in Kenjutsu are used solely to determine what kind of strikes can be performed and what the overall defense is like. In of themselves, they serve no combat purposes.Chudan no Kamae (Middle Stance): User stands with right foot forward, with weight on the right foot. Left foot sits directly behind the right foot, and turned at a slight angle to the left. Both feet should be directly underneath their shoulders. The katana is pointed at the opponents throat and is held with two hands. Arms are semi relaxed - not fully extended, and not crunched in. The elbows should be bent slightly, and the bottom of the hilt (kashira) should be about a fist away from the belly button. This is the standard dueling position. The placement of the katana keeps the opponent a swords length distance away and can repel charges by thrusting. Its middle placement gives it the opportunity to both guard and attack. This is the most well rounded of the stances. Jodan no Kamae (High Stance): User stands with left foot forward, turned at a 45 degree angle. Left foot is directly behind, turned at about a 75 to 80 degree angle. Weight is on the left foot. Katana is raised above the hand, and angled back at about a 45 degree angle. It is held with both hands. The arms should be bent, almost as if the kenshi was waving a baseball bat above their head. This stance is highly aggressive, leaving the torso completely exposed. However, its placement of the sword in a high position means that it can launch an attack without having to raise it first. Additionally, this stance is also used with the one handed left hand strike which is the longest reaching technique by far. Gedan no Kamae (Low Stance): The footwork is the same as Chudan no Kamae. However, the user lowers the katana and turns the blade to the right hand side, exposing the flat of the blade up. This stance is highly defensive, and very passive in appearance. Often times used to convey a lessening of tension, it can also be used to mask surprise attacks by highly trained kenshi. Migi no Waki and Higari no Waki (Right and Left Side Stance): Migi no Waki and Higari no Waki are mirror images of each other and are simply chosen by kenshi's preference. Since most right handed kenshi used Higari no Waki, that is the one that will be described. User stands with right foot forward, turned at a 45 degree angel. Left foot is behind right foot at 75 to 80 degree angel. Both feet are planted directly under the shoulders. The katana is brought back behind the body of the kenshi until it is essentially invisible if viewed from directly in front. The blade faces the left hand side. This is a highly secretive stance, as it masks the katana from sight of the opponent. In fact, this stance is rarely used due to the tremendous danger that comes from using it. With the katana all the way behind them, the kenshi is particularly slow to guard. Most often, this stance is used for high powered one hit strikes designed to completely kill a target with one move as the rotational force of the cut as it swings around adds significant strength and speed. Nukitsuke:The basic and most fundamental aspect of any Iaijutsu styles is the Nukitsuke. While it comes in many variations and forms, the spirit of the technique is still the same - to kill with the draw of the sword. At the Academy Level, only the most basic Nukitsuke is taught with the focus resting on the discipline, and general strength necessary to draw a sword with one hand. Only until the utter basics have been learned can a kenshi advance in his or her training. The strength of the kenshi allows nukitsuke at this level to be performed smoothly and steadily though they may lack speed and power. Nukitsuke can easily cut through clothing, flesh, and wet bamboo mats, but not much else.Nukitsuke - Chudan Kiri (Draw - Middle Cut): Nukitsuke - Chudan Kiri is the most basic draw that can be performed. Starting with the katana in the sheath (saya), blade up, the user brings the hilt, (tsuka) to around the belly button area with his left hand by moving the saya. The right hand then grabs the tsuka and draws straight forward, blade still up. At the same time, the left hand pulls the saya back slightly. When the tip (kisaki) is about to leave the saya, the kenshi rotates the sword until the blade faces the left, and then with arm almost completely extended, swings and cuts in a straight horizontal pattern in front. This technique is practiced thousands of times over by beginners until it eventually becomes second nature to draw. Chudan Kiri can also refer to a horizontal cut aimed at the eyes or groin/thigh area when the kenshi is kneeling. Though these aren't the "middle" of the body, the cut is still the same and such is still considered Chudan Kiri. Kirioroshi: Kirioroshi is the name for the second blow in the case Nukitsuke does not finish off the opponent. More often than not, it is a general term used for all Kenjutsu techniques that are used when a Nukitsuke fails to dispatch its target. At the academy level, kenshi only learn a few basic kata, all of which are designed to train and build comfort in drawing. As such, Kirioroshi is incredibly limited in its early stages, and even in late stages, still takes a back seat to Nukitsuke. Kirioroshi at this stage is somewhat slow but has a little more power than Nukitsuke since it is two handed. Kenshi can cut through human bone.Kirioroshi - Yokokiri (Strike - Middle Cut):Kirioroshi - Yokokiri is very similar to its Nukitsuke counterpart. Kirioroshi - Yokokiri can be performed from Chudan, Jodan, or Higari no Waki. The kenshi simply brings the sword back and swings in a horizontal path. Yokokiri can be performed from both the left and right. The movement should be swift and unwavering to ensure a clean cut. Kirioroshi - Shomen (Strike - Straight Head Cut): A straight vertical cut designed to cleave an opponent in two, the Kirioroshi - Shomen can be performed from Chudan or Jodan no Kamae. With both hands holding the sword above their head, the kenshi "draws" an arc from about 30 degrees back, all the way to the floor. Kirioroshi - Yokomen (Strike - Side Head Cut): A variation of Shomen, Yokomen is designed to strike the sides of the head. Performed in nearly the same way, the only difference is the sword is tilted back, just before the cut is performed. It is important to note that the sword IS NOT tilted when raising it above the head since this gives away what direction the attack will come from. By using random variations of Yokomen, kenshi can keep targets preoccupied and guessing as to where the next attack will come from. Kirioroshi - Tsuki (Strike - Throat Thrust):The simplest of the thrusting techniques, it is ironic that while Tsuki is the first thrusting technique taught, it is also the one that is reserved for high level kenshi to use during practice due to its dangerous nature. A wrongly performed Tsuki during practice can severely injure a partner; and it is for this reason that it is taught so early on. Taking virtually no skill, Tsuki is a sort of offensive guard to discourage opponents who may try to recklessly charge in. By simply stepping in and pushing the kisaki towards the opponents throat. Tsuki can only be performed from Chudan no Kamae. Chiburi:Chiburi, literally the shaking of the enemy's blood, is performed with one hand. At the academy level, Chiburi is trained until it becomes relatively smooth and graceful to perform.Noto: The kenshi is still getting use to his/her sword. Noto will undoubtedly be unnerving and slightly shaky.Perception: At this point, the focus is not on perception and reflex, but rather getting basic movements down so they become second hand nature. Perception and reflexes are equal to that of an average Genin.Strategy: Strategy at the academy level is simply a codification of basic dueling principles.Distance: Maintain a constant distance between you and your opponent. The distance should be close enough so that you can strike with one step forward but far enough so that you can retreat if your opponent strikes at you. Balance: Maintain center of balance at all times. Always try to make your opponent loose his/her balance and when that happens never let them regain it. Points of Attack: There are five basic points of attack for a kenshi: Men (Head), Kote (Wrists) Do (Ribs/Torso), Tsuki (Throat) and Sune (Shins): While it is acceptable to strike other parts of the body, these are the ones that will do the most damage. A head strike, or throat thrust is an almost instant kill, while a strike to the torso will sever an opponent in half. Striking the wrists is an excellent way to incapacitate an opponent while striking the shins can severely restrict the movement of a duelist.	4	5				2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
943	2	2	Sleeping Blue Dragon 	Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu	Nukitsuke:At stage two, the focus is on increasing the speed of the Chudan Kiri. By stage two, drawing Chudan Kiri is second nature. Its speed has increased moderately and can usually be done in time to deflect an attack though it is still too slow to pre-empt and cut the enemy directly. Two new draws are also learned at this stage, the Gedan Kiri and Jodan Kiri. At this stage, Nukitsuke strength has improved to the point where it can cut through a foot of some of the softer, dry woods.Nukitsuke - Gedan Kiri (Draw - Low (Rising) Cut): Gedan Kiri, is the rising cut, used most often against aerial targets. The technique begins by turning the sheathed katana, blade down, then, following the convex contour of the blade, the katana is drawn. The path of the katana is a rising diagonal from left to right. While this kind of draw lacks the ability to track horizontally moving targets, it is great against vertically moving targets. Additionally, it allows for less down time between the Nukitsuke and any vertical Kirioroshi. Gedan Kiri can be executed while the kenshi sits in seiza. The draw is performed during the rise. Nukitsuke - Jodan Kiri (Draw - High (Dropping) Cut):Jodan Kiri is similar to the Gedan Kiri in that it tracks its target vertically. However, Jodan Kiri comes from above, and probably is considered the most awkward looking of the Nukitsukes. The kenshi begins the draw with the blade up and begins to draw forward at a slightly raised angle. When the kisaki is about to leave the saya, the drawing hand greatly steepness the drawing angel so that the tsuka is well above the kenshi's head. Once the kisaki has left the saya, the katana is whipped straight down so that the kisaki begins its cutting art from the moment it leaves its sheath. The draw ends with the katana very low, below the waist line. Because of the awkward nature of Jodan Kiri, it is not performed often. However, it has the advantage of catching people off guard who usually don't expect the initial draw to cut from above. Kirioroshi: Kirioroshi has gained slightly more strength and speed in its cuts. The focus is on cementing the basics into the mind and body of the kenshi. Old techniques are still focused on so that they become second nature and flawless. The speed of Kirioroshi still lacks behind that of Nukitsuke but the strength gap has increased slightly with Kirioroshi being the stronger one. The focus on training old techniques is demonstrated by the fact that only one new strike is taught at stage two. Kirioroshi at this stage can cut through a foot of moderately hard dry wood.Kirioroshi - Kesakiri (Strike - Diagonal Cut):The Kesakiri does not differ much from Shomen or Yokomen and the only reason it is taught slightly later is due to its diagonal nature. Whereas the Yokomen was a diagonal cut to the head, the Kesakiri is a diagonal cut through the body and so the angel is sharper, and more force is needed. Any kenshi lacking the strength to complete the cut or the training to hold the katana stable runs a very high risk of breaking the sword if it does not cut cleanly. Kesakiri begins above the head, with the katana pointed straight back, much like Yokomen and Shomen. This is done to mask the intentions of the kenshi who can now launch three different attacks from a single starting position. Only when the katana begins to fall, is it shifted to its diagonal cutting path. Points of entry include either the shoulder blades, or under the armpits, depending on the situation. Kesakiri is a highly efficient technique for striking the Do; even more so than Yokokiri. The reason being that Kesakiri can be used while the opponent is about to perform a vertical strike, and thus exposes his or her torso. However, Yokokiri lacks any sort of meaningful defense against vertical attacks, whereas Kesakiri allows the kenshi to clash swords if he does not feel he could perform the attack fast enough without getting hurt. Chiburi: Chiburi has not changed at all and will not change very much until later stages. At this point, kenshi may opt for personalized, more stylized, chiburi.Noto: The kenshi has greater familiarity with his/her sword. Noto can be performed with a steady hand though it is still a bit slow.Perception: Now that basic movements have become second nature, reflexes can be trained. At this point, physical reflexes are the focus. At this stage, kenshi should be fast enough to guard against attacks from other Genin of this stage, and can partially keep up with Genin in the stage above.Strategy: At Stage Two, users finish learning the basics of dueling.Distance:There are two safe zones when fighting against other weapons. The zone beyond the reach of the blade and the zone inside the path of the blade. Use size differences in blades and reach length to exploit these safe zones as a point of attack. Opportunities of Attack: At the academy level, basic opportunities of attack are taught. The simplest is striking the Do when an opponent raises his or her sword to strike. A second opportunity is when an opponent aggressively charges in to attack. By stepping in and performing Tsuki, the kenshi can drive back the attacker or even kill him or her. Finally, striking the Kote while the opponent is in Chudan no Kamae is a good way to initiate an attack. Usually, it will be deflected, but if the kenshi is fast enough, he or she can cut the hands off an opponent. Parrying: Diverting the force of an attack is always easier than blocking it. Letting an opponent's blade slide off yours not only reduces how much strength is needed to push back, but also forces his blade into awkward and unwanted positions. This sliding of blades can be used to the kenshi's advantage by using it as an opportunity to advance into the safe zones.	4	5				5	9	0	0	0	6	0	0	0
943	3	3	Sleeping Blue Dragon 	Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu	Nukitsuke: Stage three is the peak of Genin development. Nukitsuke is swift and smooth. Its speed has increased moderately and can guard against virtually all physical attacks at Stage Three. Nukitsuke can also pre-empt and cut opponents who aren't above average on the speed scale. The last draw a Genin learns is the Maru Kiri. At this stage, Nukitsuke strength has improved to the point where it can cut through a foot of the all but the hardest woods.Nukitsuke - Maru Kiri (Draw - Circle Cut):The Maru Kiri is not a particularly difficult draw to perform but is one of the most useful. Even high level Jounin use this draw regularly simply because of its efficiency and coverage. As its name implies the Maru Kiri cuts in a circle around the user. The opening of the draw is just like Chudan Kiri however, instead of stopping the blade once the drawing hand has reached the right side, the kenshi continues spinning, using the momentum of the draw to maintain movement. During practice, it may seem this draw requires more balance and rotational speed than anything else, but when used in actual combat, requires considerable force to execute properly. Since the Maru Kiri was designed as a draw to counter against multiple surrounding opponents, it anticipates the kenshi having to cut through multiple targets. To maintain rotational speed while performing this feat requires considerable strength. As such, Genin who use this technique will find it difficult to use for its true intended purpose. Instead, Genin often use this as a way to draw quickly against opponents behind them. Kirioroshi: Kirioroshi speed has reached the point where it has the ability to claim a position as one of the faster sword based Taijutsu styles at this stage. Strength increases are not as glamorous, with Kirioroshi having only enough strength to cut through about a foot and a half of the hardest wood. Two new strikes are taught at this stage; the Higari Tsuki and Gyaku Tsuki.Kirioroshi - Higari Tsuki (Strike - Left Hand Thrust): Higari Tsuki is a thrust performed with only the left hand, holding the very bottom of the tsuka. When thrusting, the entire body turns to face right with left food forward and left hand outstretched. Higari Tsuki is a thrust with a lot more range than the traditional two handed thrust. There are two variations to performing this technique. The offensive variant has the kenshi stepping from a ready position into the Higari Tsuki. The defensive variant has the kenshi stepping backwards, bringing the katana back so that it is eye level before stepping forward and thrusting. The defensive variant gives the kenshi time to evade an incoming attack while preparing the counter response and tends to be more powerful due to the coiling up and preparation that goes into the strike. Kirioroshi - Gyaku Tsuki (Strike - Reverse Thrust): The Gyaku Tsuki is a fairly difficult thrust to perform due to its proximity to the kenshi's own body. The thrust is usually performed by stabbing the katana backwards between the left arm and torso. Therefore, great care must be taken when practicing to avoid injuries. Occasionally this be performed on the outside of the left arm but this generally lacks the surprise and power that the more traditional and common variation has. This technique is designed to strike opponents behind the kenshi when time to turn around is not an option. However, because the kenshi has his or her back to the opponent, and a thrust has very little coverage (compared to a cut), it has to be performed in very close proximity to ensure a hit. Chiburi:Chiburi has changed little.Noto:Noto is now a smooth and graceful motion. Its speed has increased slightly.Perception: Physical reflexes continue to be perfected. At this stage, kenshi should be fast enough to guard against nearly all physical attacks from other Genin of this stage, and can adequately read the movements of Chunin in the stage above. However, their physical movements may limit their ability to respond in proper speed, even if their mind and eyes can spot the signs.Strategy: At Stage Three, users finish learning the basics of dueling.Psychology: A duel is as much of a metal battle as it is a physical battle. Genin are taught to stand firm and suppress their fears in duels, instead concentrating on their technique. This allows them to hold a little better against intimidating opponents who may very well be of a higher skill level than themselves. On the flip side, Genin are also taught to exploit the emotions of their opponents. Inciting anger, creating fear, and sowing confusion will throw an opponents game off. Mistakes are more likely to be made if the opponent is trembling in fear. It is completely acceptable to feign superiority to scare off opponents which may be too much to handle in reality.	4	5				7	13	0	0	0	8	0	0	0
943	4	4	Sleeping Blue Dragon 	Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu	Nukitsuke: It is at this stage when Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu begins to distinguish itself in speed. It is at this stage that chakra boosting comes into play. Having reached the edge of normal human physical capabilities, the kenshi must now rely on using chakra to accelerate his or her muscles for a faster draw. The blade has reached the point where it begins to blur in its appearance. Most Chunin will find it very difficult to keep up with the speed of the draw. The cutting power of Nukitsuke from this point will begin to rely on the speed of the blade rather than the actual muscular strength of the kenshi. Nukitsuke now possess the power to cut through the hardest wood and can cut all but the largest trees down in a single move. The kenshi also learns three new draws; the Gyaku Chudan Kiri, the Tsuka Kiri, and the Kojiri Kiri.Nukitsuke - Gyaku Chudan Kiri (Draw - Reverse Middle Cut):The Gyaku Chudan Kiri is a complex move designed to confuse an opponent and also provide an opportunity to strike at unguarded areas. The draw is performed like a normal Chudan Kiri. However, once the katana has left the saya, instead of cutting across, the kenshi raises the tsuka slightly, and then whips the katana around his or her head to deliver a blow the opponent's left hand side. The confusing appearance of the draw and unexpected striking location tend to throw off opponents, allowing the hit to land even though it takes slightly more time to execute than a traditional Chudan Kiri. Nukitsuke - Tsuka Kiri (Draw - Hilt Cut): The Tsuka Kiri and its reverse counterpart the Kojiri Kiri are two of the fastest draws in a kenshi's arsenal. Tsuka Kiri is performed when the distance between the kenshi and opponents are too small to draw normally and/or if there is not enough time to draw normally. Instead of pulling the sword out first, the kenshi steps in to near point blank range and thrusts the katana out, striking the opponent will the hilt of the sword. The kenshi then immediately steps backwards, and draws a Chudan Kiri. Whether the Tsuka actually hits is irrelevant since it forces the opponent back and into a defensive position giving time to perform a cut. If the Tsuka does in fact hit, it can be a painful stunning blow leaving them completely open to attack. Tsuka Kiri completely relies on speed and the belief from the enemy that no swordsman would ever get so close. Nukitsuke - Kojiri Kiri (Draw - Sheath Butt Cap Cut): The Kojiri Kiri relies on the exact same principle as the Tsuka Kiri except instead of striking forward with the hilt, it strikes backwards with the butt of the sheath. Generally, Kojiri Kiri is a little harder to execute because the length of the striking point to the users hand is a lot longer (meaning inaccuracies) and also simply because the kenshi is facing backwards. Nevertheless, opponents generally have very little guard when attacking from behind thinking they are immune to response. Kojiri Kiri exploits that false belief in security. Kojiri Kiri uses Maru Kiri as its draw instead of the Chudan Kiri. Kirioroshi: Kirioroshi speed has increased and now allows the kenshi to be a lighting fast duelist. Strength increaes rely on chakra boosting and speed. It is at this stage that Nukitsuke begins to surpass Kirioroshi in cutting power since both rely on speed and since Kirioroshi is generally slower. However, at stage four the gap is minimal. Kirioroshi, like Nukitsuke, possess the power to cut through the hardest wood and can cut all but the largest trees down in a single move. The kenshi also learns two new techniques, one of which is the start of the Seiryuu Batsu branch of attacks.Kirioroshi - Sekken Kiri (Strike - Sweeping Cut): The Sekken Kiri is a low attack designed to cut the legs. It can be thought of as a low Maru Kiri. Directing the edge of the blade to the right, the kenshi begins to rotate around, while simultaneously lowering his or her body. By the time the kenshi is a quarter of the way around, he or she will be at the lowest point and the spin continues until a 360 degree path is cut. The rapidness by which the kenshi lowers him or herself makes this an excellent counter attack against horizontal attacks as it serves both to evade the attack as well as strike a vital target; the legs. Chiburi: Chiburi has changed little.Noto: Noto is smooth and quick.Perception: Physical reflexes are nearing perfection. Training for mental perception begins. At this stage, kenshi should be fast enough to start pre-empting attacks, and striking before hand. However, most responses will be very basic and simplistic. Chuunin at this stage can hold their own against Chuunin at Stage Five but will find themselves heavily on the defensive with few opportunities to attack. Kenshi are now trained in spotting ambushes or possible gang ups. They are taught to note everything in their surrounding environment and to always have an escape plan.Strategy: Kenshi learn how to deal with multiple opponents.Distance:The best strategy when sandwiched between multiple opponents is to aggressively close the distance between you and an opponent. Not only does this provide you with the opportunity to punch through if you are surrounded, but by closing the distance between you and a single opponent, you also increase the distance between you and all the other opponents, especially the one behind you which is the most troublesome. Attacking: Always attack as many opponents at once as possible if punching out is not an option. This ensures that your aggressors are always on guard and do not have the opportunity to attack you. Sweeping horizontals are particularly effective especially for launching surprise attacks against opponents behind you. Escaping:There is honor in combat and dishonor in failure. But honor can always be regained when lost. Death is an absolute where honor can never be regained. Thus, running is sometimes an option. Use your environment to your advantage. Create chaos and disappear into it. If surrounded, do not be afraid to be slightly reckless. A few injuries sustained from punching out are better than death.	4	5			Kirioroshi - Seiryuu Batsu - Shiten Tsuki (Strike - Blue Dragon Attack - Four Point Thrust):The Seiryuu Batsu attacks (and hence the Seiryuu in the name) are named as such because these attacks are incredibly fast and because of the chakra needed leave distinct blue cutting lines. All Seiryuu Batsu attacks are not required for progression to later stages, but a true master would do well to learn them. (In order to learn a Seiryuu Batsu, a kenshi must have learned all Seiryuu Batsu before that.) The Shiten Tsuki is the simplest of the Seiryuu Batsu. It uses a powerful chakra burst to accelerate the kenshi for a brief moment, where the kenshi closes the distance. During this period, the katana is brought back, parallel to the ground and face, point forward. When the kenshi is around a foot away, he or she strikes forward, usually towards the upper torso. A second chakra burst powers up the arms and the kenshi proceeds to stab the opponent three more times. All of this happens at a much faster rate than any current or previous speed of attack. The weakness in this attack is its inability to penetrate guard. If the opponent throws up a guard before the kenshi can strike, none will land since the high speed throws out any possibility of changing points of attack. This attack, unlike other non Seiryuu Batsu attacks drains a measurable amount of chakra, and for reserve reasons, kenshi are told not to use this attack (and all other Seiryuu Batsu) in rapid succession. A one post cool down is required, and excessive use will severely drain the kenshi.	16	17	12	0	0	14	0	0	0
943	5	5	Sleeping Blue Dragon 	Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu	Nukitsuke: The blade has reached the point where it blurs significantly in appearance. Most Chunin at this stage will find it very difficult to keep up with the speed of the draw. Jounin will not have the luxury of being relaxed when dealing with the speed of Nukitsuke. Nukitsuke now possess the power to cut through two foot blocks of concrete. The kenshi also learns two new draws; the Niten Kiri, and the Seiryuu Batsu - Ushiro Kiri.Nukitsuke - Niten Kiri (Draw - Two Way Cut):The Niten Kiri is a expansion of Chudan Kiri. By taking advantage of the increased speed, kenshi deliver a second blow after the initial draw by cutting back to the left. When used successfully, Niten Kiri leaves a huge mess by cutting its target into three pieces. The greatest advantage of the Niten Kiri, however, is not its increased killing potential, but its ability to strike twice. Opponents who may simply be expecting a Chudan Kiri may be caught by surprise when the second stroke comes back in. Kirioroshi: Kirioroshi speed has increased and now allows the kenshi to be a lighting fast duelist. Strength increases rely on chakra boosting and speed. Nukitsuke is now noticeably faster and stronger than Kirioroshi. Kirioroshi now has the power to cut through a foot of concrete. The kenshi also learns the only solely defensive technique in this style of Iaijutsu, the Hyoujin Koutetsu Kaiten.Kirioroshi - Hyoujin Koutetsu Kaiten (Strike - Sharp Armor Revolution): Hyoujin Koutetsu Kaiten was developed after kenshi realized they were more or less helpless against long range projectiles. While the average shuriken or kunai can easily be dodged with raw speed, waves of said items or arrows proved problematic, especially when coming in from multiple angles. Thus the Hyoujin Koutetsu Kaiten was developed. By holding the katana hilt up, and kisaki down - in essence, holding the blade vertically, pointed down - the kenshi is able to rotate rapidly around, creating a cocoon of steel. This technique is particularly hard to execute because in order to get the rotational speed needed without using the body's momentum, the kenshi must learn to mold large amounts of chakra into their feet, and then spin it. Chiburi: Kenshi learn the only practical use for chiburi - the ChihimatsuChiburi - Chihimatsu (Blood Shake - Blood Spray): Chihimatsu is a distraction and psychological warfare technique where chiburi is used to fling blood at enemies. Chihimatsu is usually aimed at the eyes, and requires far more speed than a traditional chiburi to give the spray additional range. Kenshi have found this technique useful for distracting opponents, or bliding them temporarily. Even if the blood does not get into the eyes, some opponents may find it rather distracting to have their own blood flung back at them. Noto:Noto has changed little.Perception: Perception is now solely dependent on the mind. Spotting reflexes are continually trained on with kenshi practicing the memorization of their locations. Kenshi also begin to learn how to read body language. Though they are incapable of pre-empting before an attack has even started, they at least know it in their mind. It is now a matter of their body catching up.Strategy:Kenshi learn how to utilize their environment and win the psychological battle.Distance: Kenshi are taught good locations for fighting. If going against multiple opponents, fight in areas which force groups of opponents to split up. For example, a forest will put trees between your opponents giving you a barrier in which you can kill individual targets without worrying about your backside. Psychology: The illusion of omni presence is completely unnerving. Use your speed advantage to make it appear as if you are constantly everywhere around your enemy. Projection of voice, and creating sounds elsewhere are all integral to the illusion that you have single handedly surrounded your enemy.	4	5			Nukisuke - Seiryuu Batsu - Ushiro Kiri (Draw - Blue Dragon Attack - Back Cut): Ushiro Kiri takes the idea of backstabs to a whole new level. One of the most difficult moves to perform, the speed acquired here is integral to later stages multi directional cutting. The theory behind Ushiro Kiri is to strike an opponent where he or she least expect it which is the backside. Facing the kenshi, the enemy worries most about the front and sides, thinking that it would be nearly impossible to get behind them. Ushiro Kiri does exactly that. By using an enormous burst of chakra, the user literally runs past the opponent before turning around and slashing into the back. The amount of training and chakra needed to have the speed to get behind the opponent without them reacting is monumental. In order to prepare for the attack, the kenshi must start gathering energy for one post, limiting their attacks to Stage Three and below for that post. Once the attack has been executed, there is a three post cool down. The tradeoff for this heavy cost is a blazing fast attack that will be very difficult to react to.	17	23	16	0	0	16	0	0	0
943	6	6	Sleeping Blue Dragon 	Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu	Nukitsuke: The blade has reached the point where the blade is virtually invisible, appearing as nothing more than a translucent wave. Jounin at this stage will be heavily on the defensive, and any attempt at ambush or first strike is almost guaranteed failure. It is at the Jounin stage that kenshi begin to truly fulfill the doctrine of One Cut One Kill, as most enemies will not have any time to respond. Nukitsuke now possess the power to cut through two foot blocks of soft metal. The kenshi also learns two new draws; the Hachten Kiri, and the Seiryuu Batsu - Shiho Kiri, Â Nukitsuke - Hachten Kiri (Draw - Eight Way Cut):The Hachten Kiri is the final (non Seiryuu Batsu) draw, learned by kenshi and represents the pinnacle of human speed without the aid of massive chakra bursts. The Hachten Kiri is a high speed draw combo that cuts both ways along the four main axis, both diagonals, horizontal, and vertical. Kenshi are allowed to mix up which paths they cut first depending on the situation making the Hachten Kiri as unpredictable as it is fast. The result is a deadly draw that strikes multiple times and attempts to strike wherever the enemy is not guarding. Enemies would do well to attack from a distance or have some sort of all encompassing defense if they don't want to run a large risk of cutting cut into multiple pieces Kirioroshi:Kirioroshi speed has increased and now allows the kenshi to be a lighting fast duelist. Strength increases rely on chakra boosting and speed. Nukitsuke is not significantly faster and stronger than Kirioroshi. Kirioroshi now has the power to cut through half a foot of soft metal. The kenshi also learns the most powerful and useful counterattacking technique in the Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu arsenal, the Henshin Kiri.Kirioroshi - Henshin Kiri (Strike - Deflection Cut): The Henshin Kiri is the ultimate counter attack technique in a kenshi's arsenal. In fact it is quite simple, as it is only a fusion of already learned techniques, and already learned strategies. Nevertheless, its fusion into a single fluid technique makes it as deadly as it is.By sliding the blade along the enemy blade, the kenshi is able To come in very close and cut well within - and out of - the enemies guard zone. However, the effectiveness of this technique is based on the enemies continued attack. Thus, almost no resistance can be given to push the attack back. Instead, the kenshi must be very fluid and move with the attack, while stepping in for the cut. This is incredibly dangerous and requires not only raw courage, but the coordination to let the enemy attack continue without hurting the kenshi. If done properly however, the kenshi will be able to attack with the enemy having no ability to defend. Chiburi: Chiburi has changed little.Noto: Noto has changed little.Perception: Perception is now solely dependent on the mind. Kenshi are nearing mastery of how to read body language. By analyzing facial expressions, shifts in body weight and tenseness of muscles, the kenshi is able to discern to a very accurate level, what the enemy is about to do. Kenshi still lack the quickness of mind to deliver a pre emptive attack before an attack is initiated, but are able to plan their response.Strategy:Kenshi learn how to maximize use of their environmentObjects: Use all objects at your disposal to achieve any of the earlier points of strategy. This includes kicking up sand, throwing buckets or entangling opponents in clothes lines etc. Shadows: Kenshi are taught to use the shadows to hide themselves from enemies. Additionally, by running through patches of light and then back into shadow, they can more easily distort their enemies visions. Once the enemy has looked into light, they will be virtually blind when looking into shadows. Anchors: Use walls and posts to rapidly change your direction of attack without slowing down or loosing power. This is integral in battles against multiple opponents or in duels against very fast enemies. Hidden Enemies:If you cannot find your enemies or they are hidden, place yourself in an open field where you can see them coming for a good distance. Otherwise, make sure that you are the one hidden.	4	5			Nukitsuke - Seiryuu Batsu - Shiho Kiri (Draw - Blue Dragon Attack - Four Direction Cut):The Shiho Kiri is a technique useful against both a single target and large groups. Like the Hachten and Niten Kiri, it attempts to cut the enemy multiple times in different areas. However, whereas the Hachten and Niten Kiri were all done facing the opponent, Shiho Kiri is executed by attacking from different directions. The result is a slightly longer delay between each cut but the opportunities it opens up by allowing the kenshi to attack every side is invaluable. On the flip side, this technique can also be used against multiple opponents since instead of attacking from multiple directions, the kenshi simply travels to different opponents. Due to the enormous chakra demands, the kenshi must store chakra for three posts, during which he or she is limited to Stage Two techniques. There is also a five post cool down. Despite these costs, the Shiho Kiri is one of the most potent techniques in a kenshi's arsenal.	25	30	21	0	14	22	0	0	0
943	7	7	Sleeping Blue Dragon 	Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu	Nukitsuke: The final stage of Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu is a truly spectacular demonstration of speed and reflex. The pinnacle of this style's speed is manifested here. Oddly enough, a stage seven draw is far more visible than a stage six draw. However, its visibility means nothing because the draw speed is now so absurdly fast that many opponents would die before they even made sense of what they saw. Because it is nearly impossible to improve speed through the human body alone, stage seven achieves its maximum speed by using a technique known as Choukoku.Kirioroshi:Kirioroshi speed has also maxed out with attacks being nothing more than a translucent blur. Kirioroshi strength has reached the point where it can cut through two feet of soft metal. The final dueling technique, integral to the god like speed of Kyuusoku Seiryuu Iaijutsu is learned at this stage.Kirioroshi - Juukan Kiri (Strike - Running Cut):The Juukan Kiri is a cut that has no swing. The kenshi holds the katana in a pseudo Higari no Waki position. Instead of swinging the katana however, the kenshi uses incredibly speed to run the katana through the enemy. There are three major advantages to using this technique. First, because no swinging is involved, most strength and concentration can be focused on gaining the maximum speed possible. Second, because the blade is either on the left or right hand side, it is naturally evasive since the kenshi never directly faces the opponent. Since the kenshi is simply running while towing a katana around, there is little loss in actual motion and direction can be changed much easier than if a swing had to be performed. The result is a move that can be used to attack large packs of enemies in one go as the kenshi simply dashes around the battlefield hacking his or her enemies apart with the full force of his body weight and speed. Chiburi: Chiburi has changed little.Noto: Noto has changed little.Perception: Perception is now solely dependent on the mind. Kenshi have mastered how to read body language and to adequetly respond. Often times, kenshi will know when an attack is about to occur even before the enemy has made a single move, allowing for pre emptive attacks. To kenshi at this stage, enemy movements are easily predictable and just as easily countered. They know how enemies will respond to certain attacks, and how enemies will move if presented with certain opportunities.Strategy: Kenshi learn the final, most important strategic ability; having a sharp and quick mind. Kenshi learn how to manipulate enemy positions without prior planning; that is, they are able to come up with a plan of attack in a matter of seconds. By moving in certain directions and with enough experience knowing how most enemies will react, kenshi learn to plan ahead. Attacks are absolutely efficient from the perspective on the entire battle.	4	5			Nukitsuke - Seriyuu Batsu - Choukoku (Draw - Blue Dragon Attack - Hyper Cutting):Choukoku is not at attack in of itself, but rather a technique that improves the cutting speed and power of all previous techniques, preventing techniques as simple as Chudan Kiri from becoming obsolete. The result is an excellent well rounded arsenal at the hand of the kenshi. Choukoku uses principles used in Seiryuu Batsu, but to a lesser degree. As such, it would be folly to expect Choukoku to turn all techniques into the special attacks of Seiryuu Batsu. Choukoku improves speed to the point where the path of a blade can no longer be followed. Instead, when a draw is performed, it appears as a blue line. The motion of the blade is nearly impossible to see with a normal human eye. With such speed, also comes increased cutting power, giving Nukitsuke the ability to cut through two feet of moderately hard metal (moderately hard metal includes metal chains and street lamp posts, but not swords or shuriken). Using Choukoku can be draining over long periods of time. As such, it cannot be used for more than five posts, unless there is significant resting involved. However, at this level, rarely should a battle ever draw on that long. Mechanically, this move allows the user to add their control stat to the speed of their draws for the duration of the move.	30	40	29	0	20	24	0	0	0
942	1	1	Sword of Acrobatic Feats	Kyokugi-Ken	Swings - The user has not yet learned to properly control the sword, so while the naturally large weapon does swing with significant amounts of force its user is not in control of how far those swings go or when they stop. A strike, even at this level, would mean significant damage to a target but even a Genin will not have a great amount of difficulty avoiding these attacks.Thrust - The user is not taught to thrust at all at this level, and any attempt at doing so will result in almost comical failure as the weight of the blade drags the user forward, causing them to stumble, and possibly even falling flat on their face.Acrobatics - The one and only decent trait at this level. The user is able to turn flips, rolls, cartwheels and even swing around the hilt of the blade once provided it's stuck in the ground sufficiently. These acrobatic moves, while not particularly quick serve as a means of defense through dodging.Defense - Blocking with the sword is difficult at this stage due to the lack of control. The user mostly just turns the sword side ways and crouches slightly with one shoulder against it like a large metal barricade. This is effective defense against throwing weapons but cannot be done quickly enough to block them if the move is done after they are thrown.	3	3	3	Over And Under - When the user performs this technique the first step involves thrusting the tip of the sword in to the ground and then either from momentum gained by running before planting the sword or a jumping motion preformed after planting the sword the user swings around the hilt by about 180 degrees, presumably to kick at a target in front of them. The kick, if successful, will provide the user with a means to push themselves back in an arc over the top of their planted weapon but if the attack is unsuccessful the users weight will pull the weapon out of the ground as they swing around it, causing them to fly forward and down, this is not a problem for the user however as it allows them through careful manipulation of their body to perform a low sweeping slash, presumably at the target they were just attempting to kick.		4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
942	2	2	Sword of Acrobatic Feats	Kyokugi-Ken	Swings - The user can now swing the blade with some level of proper control without too much over swing. The attacks at this level have sufficient control to make the user dangerous considering the size of their weapon but the user still lacks precise direction of the blade so it is impossible for them to swing at anything other than a 'general area'.Thrust - The user is now able to perform a thrust properly but will be unable to follow it up with anything else. Thrusts at this level are still a bit dangerous for the user because if they miss then the user is left open to counter attack. Still, the thrust does provide a decent range of attack and packs enough punch to give an enemy some pause even if it misses.Acrobatics - With the exception of the thrust, the user is now able to follow up most moves with some sort of acrobatic move that allows for a dodge following an attack. In addition to being able to follow up an attack with a dodge, the user is able to effectively utilize their skill to swing around round objects such as branches and poles, leap to and immediately spring off of a wall, and perform any number of complicated flips, leaps and jumps.Defense - Rather than simply hiding behind the sword as a means of defense the user is now able to deflect some oncoming attacks simply by swinging the sword to intercept them. The force of the weapon is enough to knock most attacks aside or at the very least halt them in their tracks. It is not an effective defense against Ninjutsu techniques however and small throwing weapons are difficult to deflect, but at this point the user is able to move the sword up quickly enough to use it as a shield.	3	3	3	Spin Fury - When using this technique the user performs a sudden 360 spinning motion with the sword. The spinning motion is an excellent way to attack multiple opponents at once or to repeatedly slash at an opponent in melee range. The power and control of this technique depends on how far out the user holds the weapon. The closer they hold the weapon to their body as they spin, the faster they will go, and the greater power they will have. The user is 'stuck' in their selected range until they stop spinning and so the user will need to decide if a weaker, slower, longer range attack or a stronger, faster, shorter range attack is appropriate in the given situation.		7	0	7	0	6	0	0	0	0
942	3	3	Sword of Acrobatic Feats	Kyokugi-Ken	Swings - The user can now swing the blade and control it sufficiently enough that there is little if any over swing. It is at this level that the user really begins to take advantage of the size and power offered by their weapon by using the swings to generate momentum that can be used to open up dodges and even new attacks through the combined use of AcrobaticsThrust - A thrust is now a powerful and dangerous attack that blasts out swiftly from the user. As a result of this increased power and control the user is no longer left as open to attack by missing a thrust and can take advantage of the power created by their attack to leap forward in the air quickly in order to dodge a counter attack.Acrobatics - Acrobatics begin to take on greater complexity and speed, making it more difficult to determine exactly how the user will counter attack. Unwise opponents will try to follow the path of the sword in order to estimate how to defend themselves as the user spins in the air, only to find a kick placed squarely in their face or stomach. While the user is able to do use acrobatics to set up for a kick as well as a slash or thrust, the kicks lack precise focus and usually only serve to knock an opponent back painfully.Defense - The improved defense at this level allows a user to precise enough control to use even their large weapon to defend against quick attacks. Defense still primarily relies upon the sheer size of the sword and the power of the use but at this stage a user has begun to understand fine control as well as power. While it is possible to deflect thrown weapons by swinging the sword, the user typically still just turns the blade sideways and uses it as a shield. The user is now able to defend against ranged Ninjutsu attacks by using their weapon to intercept them, but this defense is not perfect and the user will often suffer some injuries anyway. When attempting to intercept a ninjutsu technique it is important consider a few basic ideas: IF the character using the ninjutsu is stronger than your character, either by rank or level, it is generally extremely difficult or even impossible to successfully slash at their technique with the sword, if their is weaker than yours either by rank or by level, it should be generally assumed that blocking their ninjutsu is easier than normal. If they are at the same rank and level, then its purely up for grabs but remember: Blocking in this fashion still hurts, and their use of chakra is not nearly as harmful to them as taking partial damage from their attack is to you. Techniques with no range such as a technique used in the palm of the hand or wielded like a weapon, cannot be broken through with the sword but can be defended against normally. Series attacks, such as a group of fireballs, are difficult to defend against unless they are all packed together (which it is better to assume they are not).	3	3	3	Top Spin - A truly unconventional technique, the user of this technique actually swings the sword with one hand starting from the opposing side to the hand swinging the sword and moving in an approximate 270 degree arc with the weapon and arm swinging it extended behind them. This movement in and of itself is a decent enough attack but it is used only to set up for a more dramatic attack. As the sword swings around the back side of the user's body the user will then suddenly move upwards and back as if doing a one handed hand spring. Using one hand to hold the sword and the other to touch the ground the user combines their body motion and weapon to create a forward moving spin attack. In addition to the sword swinging through the air, the user's legs are also extended creating a powerful spinning kick motion in addition to the sword attack.		0	10	10	0	8	0	0	0	0
942	4	4	Sword of Acrobatic Feats	Kyokugi-Ken	Swings - At this level the user has obtained enough control over the weapon that they are able to attack with increased speed and power. The increased power actually causes the weapon to make a distinctive sound when swung that resembles a loud whistling sound. The improvements in speed allow for more elaborate combinations and unpredictable attacks as well as making the strikes harder to block and more difficult to avoid.Thrust - Thrusts actually generate a cone of air around the sword that rapidly blasts outward. While the blasts are not sufficient to do real harm they will knock a human sized target back a few steps away from the sword. This air does not extend forward any farther than the blade itself does. The thrusts at this level are dangerous tools in the hands of the right user and come out swiftly enough that avoiding them completely can be a problem. When a thrust is preformed the movement and air around the sword cause the blade to vibrate slightly, creating a ringing sound.Acrobatics - The wider range of control and increased speed of the user now allows them to not only use an acrobatic move in order to dodge and set up another attack but also to become a bending, twisting, jumping machine that works as a universal defense system. Up until this level the primary use of the acrobatic tricks taught to the user was to allow them to use their power created by their weapon in unusual ways but now the acrobatics become an important tactical tool used to avoid all manner of attacks and counter.Defense - The user has not only learned to use their weapon to defend against incoming attacks but has actually begun to take advantage of the weapons reach by blocking attacks using the end of the blade further away from the hilt. Normally a defensive move is less effective when the attack strikes further away from the hilt but this disadvantage has become an advantage to the user as they have learned to deal with the decreased leverage they experience when an attack strikes near the tip of their weapon. This new method of defense makes it difficult to get near the user of the weapon when they are defending due to the deliberate effort by the user to keep the sword between themselves and the attacker.	3	3	3	Javelin Thrust - With this technique the user literally leaps in to the air and throws their weapon much like a javelin. This is a slightly specialized attack in that it requires some very specific training to be done correctly and requires special training above and beyond what is required for normal level four skill. It is possible for a user to have obtained the level of skill required to learn this technique but still not know it because they haven't undergone the special training it requires. Besides making for a highly effective 'javelin' attack, the sheer force of the weapon striking the ground is enough to momentarily stun anyone that it lands within five feet from. This stun, while brief, is usually sufficient to allow the user to retrieve their weapon.Note: Stun does not last long enough to extend in to another post, so a 'target' need not stand around stunned for their post but they should probably react to it 'the effect only lasted a moment and then he responded by'		14	14	15	0	14	0	0	0	0
942	5	5	Sword of Acrobatic Feats	Kyokugi-Ken	Swings - The 'whistling' sound that was heard at the last level is now very distinct and loud enough to be heard from some distance. This sound can be a bit of a problem for the user if they are trying to kill somebody quietly but the large nature of the weapon makes it impractical for stealthy use to begin with. Enemies familiar with the weapon and the person using it at this level have often come to know, respect, and possibly even fear this sound. Swings are now extremely swift and often not bothered by minor obstacles such as trees or wooden posts. Stone will often split and chip and split but proves an effective barrier while metal remains largely able to withstand repeated blows from the large weapon.Thrust - The ringing sound is now accompanied by a roar of wind as the blade thrusts forward. As with the previous level, wind 'blasts' out away from the blade as it is thrust and while this wind is not any stronger than before it does now travel forward out from the blade. The combined power of the thrust along with the air it creates causes wood to split and several inches of stone to shatter but this only happens if the sword actually hits the wood or stone in question.Acrobatics - The speed and seemingly random nature of the acrobatics at this level make predicting exactly which way the user will move next difficult. The control allows the user to endlessly bounce and leap between objects such as walls, trees, and rocks which not only makes them difficult to hit but also allows them to set up attacks from strange angles or to rapidly bounce between multiple opponents to keep them confused and in disarray tactically.Defense - In terms of defense the user is only slightly better than the previous level but now they have one new advantage added to their defense: They are able to use the power of their weapon to block even ranged ninjutsu attacks, usually by simply slashing through the attack with the power of their weapon. Although this defense against ranged attacks looks spectacular and can be extremely unsettling to an attacker, it should not be taken lightly. The amount of power required to simply 'blow through' a ninjutsu attack like this is even greater than it appears to be and blocking more than a few attacks can be exhausting.	3	3	3	Shockwave - When using this technique the user holds the sword firmly in both hands and then extends it straight up suddenly before slashing back down abruptly. The sheer force of this blow is powerful enough but the real effect comes from the shockwave effect it creates in a wave formation in front of the user. The wave effect only extends a few feet out from the sword and its duration is extremely short but the sheer power of it is sufficient to shatter all but the most sturdy obstacles, including people as a direct hit from the shockwave produces enough force to cause serious injury (Injury will be 'crushing' as opposed to ripping and tearing).		19	19	18	0	16	0	0	0	0
942	6	6	Sword of Acrobatic Feats	Kyokugi-Ken	Swings - The 'whistle' now sounds more like a roar and a visible trail is seen in the air as the huge sword seems to cleave the very air as it moves. Wood is now completely ineffective as a means to stop the weapons path and even stone provides little protection. Metal is still an effective barrier but metal still proves something of a barrier. Attempting to block a swing from the user at this level with another weapon will often result in the target reeling back in the direction the attack cave from, an effect which can be countered by the opponents own skill if they are at the same level. Thrust - Thrusts are now so fast and so powerful that blocking them is a near impossibility and so targets usually and wisely move out the way instead if they can. Even if they dodge the sheer power of the attack sends out a blast of air strong enough to lift an adult sized person within one foot of the blade and toss them through the air hard enough to cause damage if they strike a hard object. Targets outside of the one foot radius around the blade still feel the rush of wind pushing against them, but they are not affected by it. Small throwing weapons that come within one foot of the sword during a thrust are also knocked aside.Acrobatics - The user's body is now literally a ball of reflexes that is best described as a human spring. They can turn, jump, dive, flip, roll and cartwheel over and around just about everything thrown at them so quickly that a doujutsu is required to follow the user's movements. These acrobatic movements when combined with sword attacks make the user a seemingly endlessly slashing and thrusting blur of movement that can give even experienced opponents a moments hesitation before approaching within range of such a huge weapon spinning in the air.Defense - While many of the methods of defense remain the same as previous levels the user is now able to perform them with incredible levels of speed and precision, seemingly able to knock aside attack after attack with their huge weapon. The main difference in the defense at this level is that the user has learned to swing their weapon in anticipation of an attack and unless an attacker compensates for this during their attack they will often find their arm or arms numbed from the impact unless they are using a very large weapon themselves.	3	3	3	Slam - Using extremely precise control of the sword the user swings the flat side of the blade toward a target and instead of following throw with the attack they stop it at just the right moment in order to produce a powerful slamming attack that works in similar fashion to a martial artist breaking a piece of wood or brick. While not precisely deadly the attack can still be devastating if properly used causing severe injury to an opponent. If a target should happen to block this technique with a weapon dead on without deflection the resulting impact will send severe vibration through the targets weapons and in to their body, rattling them head to toe.		25	25	25	0	20	16	0	0	0
942	7	7	Sword of Acrobatic Feats	Kyokugi-Ken	Swings - A nearly unstoppable force. Only the skill of an opponent prevents weapons from shattering under the power the user puts forth at this level. The roar in the air created by one of these swings sounds and looks almost as if the sword is ripping the air as it moves. This 'air ripping' effect actually creates a violent stream of air directly behind the blade that is almost as violently rendering as the sword itself, this not only cases greater damage as the sword and then the air following it rips through an object, it also makes counterattacking the user from certain angles dangerous as the air makes moving behind the swing difficult. Thrust - Only the most experienced fighters are able to predict and completely avoid this attack as it comes out so suddenly that it often renders a target in two pieces before they ever knew what hit them. Even the most experienced warriors will be pushed by and momentarily stunned if they attempt to block this attack. The vortex created around the weapon requires a split second to follow the weapon but the resulting pressure causes objects to explode violently if the sword penetrates them. Acrobatics - The user now has such control over their body that they are literally capable of what seems like impossible feats, such as changing direction in mid air, attacking from inconceivable angles, and dodging through seemingly unavoidable attacks. This level of acrobatic skill is extremely quick, but its primary function is to combine speed with mastery over the body, allowing the user to be amazingly agile and extremely quick.Defense - Defense is near perfect now, as the user has the speed, control, power and knowledge to effectively use their weapon in a seemingly perfect defense. The user takes full advantage of the size and weight of the weapon to keep control of the fight in conjunction with their acrobatic skills in order to keep their exact range where they desire it and maximize effectiveness. Of course, no defense is absolutely flawless but observers of this style have noted that it is as close to being flawless as is humanly possible with this particular weapon.	3	3	3		The End - Simply put this technique is a single slash or single thrust that uses every ounce of power the user has remaining and channels it in to a single charging attack. There is almost no way to block this attack but it can be dodged by extremely skilled opponents. The resulting impact from this attack creates a sound that almost resembles an explosion and the effects of it are just as devastating. After performing this technique the user will fall to the ground, unable to do much beyond slow crawling.	33	33	33	0	24	20	0	0	0
941	1	1	Dance of the Blood Sword	Chigatana no Kenbu	The user learns the basic theories behind fighting with a sword, but has yet to actually use it in practice. While they can use the sword without risking hurting themselves they have yet achieved complete control over their weapon and can only perform a set of a few basic swings. On the other hand they usually complement their limited skills with the sword by using other means to attack. It is also important that the student begun to learn how to use both of their hands with the same ease.	4	3	2	Sanbatsu Kougeki (Triple strike Attack)True to the brawling mentality of the style, the user charges in with a shoulder tackle. After coming into contact with the enemy, the user plunge the butt of the sword into the enemies solar plexus and finishes with a swift cut from below.Hikyousenban Ryoutekiki Kougeki (Sneaky Ambidexterity Attack)The user learns how to fight with both of his hands with equal ease. If the user is left handed they will draw a kunai/use a stick, whatever and use it in their right, to attack. It is important that the movement of the off-hand if somewhat hidden in order to cause a sufficient amount of surprise.		5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
941	2	2	Dance of the Blood Sword	Chigatana no Kenbu	Having hopefully used his skills in an actual combat situation with a real sword, the user has now beginning to grasp what it means to fight with the sword. Learning that one's own skills are not all in a fight, it is important that the user learns to know what happens around him. Therefore they have begun to learn how to somewhat read their opponent. Another important aspect of the teaching at this stage is that the student must learn how to change their attack patterns regularly.	4	3	2	Hikyousenban Hikui Shoumenkougeki (Sneaky Low Frontal Attack)It is counter technique that generally works best on opponents wielding weapons. The user parries the first blow and then proceeds to move toward their opponent, plunging their knee into the user's abdomen/groin. It is cheap, unsportsmanlike and terribly effective.Hikyousenban Takai Shoumenkougeki (Sneaky High Frontal Attack)Well, in theory identical to the above mentioned technique, but instead of kneeing the groin you bash them with you bloodlust-filled head! A must for any regular bar fighter!		7	0	7	0	6	0	0	0	0
941	3	3	Dance of the Blood Sword	Chigatana no Kenbu	At this stage the primary goal is to acquire individuality in your fighting, to develop your own style in accordance to your options. One CnK user could be drastically different from another, yet what is important is their motivation and Sakki. At this stage the defence is improved due to improved technique when it comes to dodging. Their step in speed also becomes a lot faster and they learn how to better read their opponents attacks.	4	3	2	Ryuusui no ugoki (Flowing Water motion)Perhaps a very fancy word for an increased skill in their footwork by quickly changing their steps from long to short and so forth, the user's movement now seem more flowing and agile. With it their dodging ability has become accurately sharper as they move a lot smoother than before, almost flowing with precise accuracy in order to avoid an attack.Zoukiteikyousha (Organ Donor)This is the stage at which the user takes the step from being a sneaky bastard to a brutal monster. All that is needed is a sufficiently deep cut and you're halfway there. Now all that is needed is for the user to stab him with his hand and grab the first organ you can get your blood-smeared hands on and then just yank it out. Congratulations, you have now made your enemy an organ donor. (Be sure to give him a thank-you card on the way out.)	Sakki no Kanji (Feeling of Bloodlust) Level 1"First you must know your enemies intent to kill. Only then will you truly master your own." -The user has begun to learn how to sense other's lust for blood, their intention to attack, even if they try to suppress that feeling. It is an ability that can not be trained but only achieved with time and experience. It takes the form of something akin to a signal in the person's mind. He has by no means any clue of the origin of the sakki, but that signal might be enough to save the user's life. The user can only sense the sakki of someone within 5 feet.It is important to note that this Sakki-sense does not pick up objects, unless they have a conciousness.	12	0	8	0	8	0	0	0	0
941	4	4	Dance of the Blood Sword	Chigatana no Kenbu	At this stage the Chigatana no Kenbu user learns the true strength of the style. They are now able to direct their attacks only where they will cause the maximum amount of damage, knowing full well which areas are the hardest for the opponent to defend. More importantly, they increase their defence by learning the ability to make their stance completely unreadable to the opponent.Stance Name: Muteikei (Shapeless)Stage Bonuses: Supreme awesomenessStanding relaxed with the sword held almost carelessly in his hand, his other hand dug into his right pocked, even while he yawns, how come there are no openings? That is probably what most swordsmen or fighters would think when faced with the stance that is one of the core techniques of the Chigatana no Kenbu. It has no set form like most stances; instead it varies between the users. They can stand casually, but any intent on attacking them will be met instantly by the sword that was casually held moments ago. That is truly where its name comes from, it has no set shape yet there are no openings in which to attack and an attack from the user can come from any angle possible.	4	3	2	Hien (Flying Swallow)This is an attack that was made originally for the Muteiki stance. As the user swings his blade in a slash from one direction, then like a swallow in flight it changes its direction in less than a moment with a sharp flick of his wrist, drastically changing the direction of the cut, catching the opponent unguarded. While this may sound simple, it requires a tremendous strength in the wrists. It is the perfect attack for the Muteiki stance, where the opponent will have no idea where the attack will come from or hit.Karappo (Hollow)Give a style enough years under its belt and techniques to counter it are bound to pop up. Ironically it was invented by a user of the very style it was supposed to counter! Hollow is a rather unorthodox technique if you consider the average mindset of a CnK user. It is part of the mastery of your Sakki, namely to suppress it completely.There are several uses for this technique. Since the user has completely sealed off his Sakki, he will not be detected by Sakki no Kanji. They will also be unaffected by mind-reading esquÃƒÂ© techniques. While using Karappo the user can not use Sakki Kansei, Sakki Shinkirou or Attou Sakki.		16	13	14	0	14	0	0	0	0
941	5	5	Dance of the Blood Sword	Chigatana no Kenbu	At this stage the user's offence is increased greatly as he learns how to focus and project his own bloodlust so that it will affect the opponent, attacking them psychologically. Their analytical skill has become a second habit to them, enabling them to use the opponent's bad habits to their advantage and unleash the true gruesome nature of the style. Crafted from hundreds of battles is a sense of insight, a combination of being able to read the bodylanguage of their opponent together with their awareness of his or hers Sakki.	4	3	2	Sakki Kensei (Blood thirst Feint)Requirement: Sakki no Kanji Level 1A normal feint can usually be seen through easily. However fakes that have been given some kind of 'Ëœsoul' aren't seen through as easily. By placing the user's entire bloodlust into the feint and looking into the enemy's eyes, a feint will seem much, much more real.Chimamire Tsubame Gaeshi (Returning Bloody Swallow)While it is a truly wonderful technique, the weakness of the Hien is the strain it puts on the user's wrist. But at this stage the user has become so accustomed to it that he can actually put together a series of them. Chimamire Tsubame Gaeshi is in essence a simple technique.To actually invite for an attack to come, then while it has just been initiated, knock it off its course. Yet together with the mastery of the Hien, you keep the momentum by merely changing the direction after knocking the attack away and strike the opponent while he is caught off balance.Noto (Sheathing the sword)I am like the stone in the river. Unrelenting, unyielding, I will never waver from my chosen path.If there is one trait that users of CnK share, it is a clear dislike of losing. They simple won't give up as long as there is at least one shred of will and at least a pint of blood left in their body. Once they have begun to attack, they will not stop until they have done so. Arrows, impalement, few things short of cutting their throats or chopping their arm off will stop them from fulfilling that single attack. This is sometimes used as a (if rather foolish) way of catching opponents who are faster than the user.Karasu no hitomure (Murder of Crows)'The crows will descend in the wake of the Swallow'Grasping their sword they bring back their arm so that the tip of the sword is pointed toward the enemy. Using most of the strength in their upper body they lunge forward and as they begin the thrusting motion they sink lower and then shoot forward, further increasing the speed of the thrust by using the power of their legs.It is actually a two-point attack. That is because if they do manage to pierce the target, they will quickly rip it out horizontally, causing a bloody mess. Just the way you want it.	Sakki no Kanji (Feeling of Bloodlust) Level 2Requires: Sakki no Kanji Level 1The user has by now nearly mastered the ability to sense other's Sakki. They can sense a source of Sakki even if it is not directly focused at them and they can also discern between several different sources of Sakki. Range of 10 feet.	22	15	19	0	16	0	0	0	0
941	6	6	Dance of the Blood Sword	Chigatana no Kenbu	The Warlord knows how to fully unleash his innate strength and that of his style, his mere presence a solidifed avatar of bloodlust. Through extensive practice they have achieved a mastery of their own momentum, greatly incresing their offensive capabilities, the whole aspect of that practice being the "useless swordtaking" technqiue.	4	3	2	Sakki Shinkirou (Bloodthirst Mirage)The very aura around the CnK user can be focused in many different ways. When locking their eyes upon the users, his unleashed bloodlust will make it seem like his figure is flickering back and forth, with a maximum of 20 cm away from the real body. This can potentially make it harder to hit the user if ever so slightly.Kainashiken Totte (Useless sword taking)Only effective against an opponent armed with a bladed weapon, most preferably a sword. While it requires precise timing and overwhelming force, if it succeeds your foe will most certainly leaving this world. When attacked you dash into inside their guard and grab the bottom of their hilt with your hands. Then while hopefully using their own momentum, you steal it from their grasp and fulfil the attack in a full circle.Now this is possibly easier said then done, but there are several ways to ensure that you manage to get inside their guard. One tactic might be to parry the attack while stepping in, or to make a feint and last but not least overwhelm them with your monstrous bloodlust.User must have a higher strength than their opponent or have their permission (where speed might make up for a lack of strength)	Attou Sakki (Overwhelming Bloodthirst)When mastering this stage of the sword style, the user's ability to project one's own lust for blood has come to the stage when they can overwhelm weaker opponents with it. Their full bloodlust is so overwhelming that they will paralyze (one post) those with a willpower weaker than his own intent to cause harm (his own willpower). Those who have willpower as strong as himself or above are not stunned, but will still feel fear when faced with such murderous intent. After the paralysis has passed they will almost certainly feel fear and they cannot be paralysed once more in the same thread.	29	22	24	0	19	17	0	0	0
941	7	7	Dance of the Blood Sword	Chigatana no Kenbu	Their attack and defence becomes one as they can defend and counterattack in quick succession. The ferocity in their attack is much greater than before and their attacks can easily cut or break normal weapons in two. Having mastered the art of sensing and focusing Sakki, the user is now the bloodgod reborn. Now it is up to him to demand the sacrifices belonging to him.	4	3	2	Sakki Zenchizennou (Bloodthirst Omniscience)Requires: Sakki no Kanji Level 2The complete mastery of reading other's bloodlust. They are able to read changes in bloodlust and through that they are able to somewhat predict how the opponent will react with the help of reading their body-language. There are limits to this however as they only get a general idea, for example what kind of attack they will launch or from which angle, but to the opponent it will seem like they truly are able to read their mind.	Sakki no Kanji (Feeling of Bloodlust) Level 3Requires: Sakki no Kanji Level 2The user can know feel the presence of a person's Sakki if they harbor hostile thoughts at all in a 15 feet radius. It can be nothing but a brief annoyance, a flash of irritation, the user will sense it. An excellent skill when entering foreign soil, making the user able to anticipate the presence of a potential foe before his normal senses would have.	34	32	33	0	24	20	0	0	0
940	1	1	Fencing Sword Style	None	This is the first step of the Fencer's sword style. Beginners are usually slow on their feet, their accuracy is way off, their abilities to counter being almost nonexistent, and the style of properly holding the sword isn't even known yet. The shinobi at this stage should focus on his or her training and try to avoid serious complications as much as possible.Sword Abilities: Simple movements here, nothing special. Forward, back, left, right, up and down are about the only thing the Fencer is capable of.Parry Abilities: The Fencer is extremely lucky to pull one off, most of the time it ends up physically striking an opponent or missing them completely when a flat contact is needed.Dodging Abilities: Straight ahead move back and forth. The beginner still has the mindset of a competitor in a sporting arena. No real sense of movement. As long as your target is in front of you there aren't any problems here.	3	4	2			4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
940	2	2	Fencing Sword Style	None	The shinobi moves up to the most basic of the intermediate levels. Foil Intermediates have some control over their blade but still have trouble countering attacks and landing successful blows. Simple attacks work best for these users, as they are still unable to 'attack weak points for massive damage.'Sword Abilities: The fencer actually knows how to hold the sword now. The world has become three dimensional for them, they can aim wherever they want now. The speed of their sword however is still too low to be a significant threat.Parry Abilities: Defense is actually starting to form with the gaining of the Second Stage. The fencer is more than capable of completing an actual parry now, unfortunately they still haven't figured out how to parry anything else except for another sword. Its not suggested attempting to parry against shinobi who fight with their bodies and not with actual weaponry.Dodges: The user is able to move out of the way of incoming hits. This consists of running away and ducking. More training is needed in this area although the user has advanced slightly in this field compared to what the fencer was capable of during the first stage.	3	4	2			7	7	0	6	0	0	0	0	0
940	3	3	Fencing Sword Style	None	At this point in the shinobi's training they have finally got the hang of controlling the sword properly. Their form is near perfect and they have figured out how to control their body's movements so that attacks can be carried out without flaw and counterattacks are accurate and fast.Sword Abilities: The speed of the user's strikes has increased dramatically from Stage 2. The user is now able repeatedly strike an opponent during the same amount of time a regular sword user would only be able to strike once. Sword motions range from small spins to broad slashes.Parry Abilities: Parrying has become an instinct of the user now. Whenever someone attacks the user, the first thing that comes to the users mind is to parry. Blocking attacks with the parry is even easier than before. The users confidence begins to show at this stage; the fencer only parrying attacks slightly so they just miss their body.Dodges: The user understands the basics of dodging. Instead of the basic ducking or moving out of the way techniques from previous stages, sidestepping and spins are implemented at stage three. When the user is incapable of parrying then the newfound experience in the dodge comes in handy.	3	4	2			10	10	0	8	0	0	0	0	0
940	4	4	Fencing Sword Style	None	Sabre intermediate is the mid level for the style and the most common level for users of this style. Shinobi of this level are fast on their feet and are strong enough to deal deadly damage on specific parts of the body. They now have complete control over the blade's movement and the only thing left to master is how to implement it into more powerful techniques. Kicks are introduced which are implemented along side the blade.Sword Abilities: The importance of strength becomes more and more evident at stage four. The user begins to cause more and more damage with every sword strike. With speed and strength both utilized, the style starts to become a force to be reckoned with.Parry Abilities:Parrying has become an instinct of the user now. Whenever someone attacks the user, the first thing that comes to the users mind is to parry. Blocking attacks with the parry is even easier than before. The users confidence begins to show at this stage; the fencer only parrying attacks slightly so they just miss their body.Dodges:The Fencer starts developing a sixth sense with his dodging abilities. Body language of opponents comes into play, and each dodge that the fencer performs is the appropriate dodge for the next attack.Kicks:Although kicks are strictly forbidden in most fencing competitions, the shinobi fencer must learn how to kick properly in order to keep the enemy on their toes, and their head on their body. Kicks in this stage tend to be distractions and rarely enough power is put into them in order to deal major damage.	3	4	2			15	15	13	14	0	0	0	0	0
940	5	5	Fencing Sword Style	None	The Sabre Expert is a swordsman capable of controlling any situation he is in. He has feints within feints, the ability to successfully dodge and attack all within one motion, and can block almost all physical attacks that come his way. The Sabre Expert is an excellent one on one fighter with the ability to oust his opponents faster than they can react.Sword Abilities:The user's abilities increase even more at this stage, allowing the user to strike specific points on the body with exceptional accuracy. Each strike is direct, fast, and almost always leads into another movement.Parry Abilities:Intelligence of the fencer is important, always thinking ahead several moves from the present. Parries at this point are mostly used to keep the opponent within the user's control, each one leading into a separate move.Dodges:The user only continues to advance on their dodging abilities, this time mainly focusing on the combination of parries. Almost all of the dodges are accompanied by a parry, and each dodge tends to lead into an attack.Kicks:Kicks start becoming second nature to the fencer; whenever the sword is unable to get the job done, a kick joins the fray and resets the playing field. Kicks are more strategic in this stage and are aimed at hindering an opponent's performance so the fencer can focus on his or her sword techniques again.	3	4	2			20	20	16	16	0	0	0	0	0
940	6	6	Fencing Sword Style	None	Entering the highest levels of the style, Fencers begin to minimize their attacks into individual strikes capable of destroying opponent's movement abilities. They also strive to perfect dodging techniques so they themselves become impossible to physically hit. Counter attacks start to become less flashy and strive to only serve their purpose as quickly as possible. Speed begins to become the vital aspect of the style.Sword Abilities:Chains, chains, and more chains. The fencer at this point has acquired a refined taste for this ability. They are more and more likely to combine techniques with one another to form completely new techniques, filled with: feints, cancels, thrusts, and parries.Parry Abilities:Blocking is now second nature. Instead of simply parrying an attack the fencer has learned through experience that it important to learn how to block extensively. While this may not allow as many combos as a flat-out parry, blocks prevent the mishaps the parry tends to create when attacks are allowed to get as close as they can.Dodges:When you master the art of dodging on the ground, there's only one way to go. And that way is up. The fencer has perfected the art of dodging attacks from the ground and has started to perfect his abilities of aerial maneuvers. Twists and turns and other motions come into play, making the fencer even harder to strike.Kicks:Powerful kicks are introduced at this stage. The user is capable of breaking bones with his or her strikes. They are used more often and deal more damage to the opponent, sometimes being the pivotal attack during a maneuver, with the sword coming in only when necessary.	3	4	2			27	27	21	18	0	18	0	0	0
940	7	7	Fencing Sword Style	None	The user has completed their training and has become one of the few expert fencers. Harm never seems to come to them, thanks to their innate ability to dodge and parry attacks. Their sword abilities are incredible, speed, power, and maneuverability of the sword is unrivaled in the shinobi world. Very few shinobi are capable of standing up against the fencing master.Sword Abilities:The perfect fencer. The speed of the sword is blinding, the accuracy of the hits are exactly where they need to be. The sword user has the potential to cause incredible amounts of damage with the smallest slashes. Sword movements are intricate and seem to have a three sixty degree hitting range.Parry Abilities:Parries are perfected as well. All attacks can be parried and blocked. Blocking attacks from all sides and all directions is preformed with ease and with as little stress as possible. The user can make an attack come as close as a couple centimeters of the flesh and still miss the body.Dodges:The Shinobi is capable of dodging attacks with ease. The flexibility at this stage is considered incredible and the user can twist and turn their way out of an attack that may be thought of as unstoppable. The user's acrobatics come extremely handy when they fight, and could be extremely useful in tiring an enemy.Kicks:: If the user wanted, they could fight with their legs only. Their kicks are varied and they are forceful. Most of the time these kicks will catch opponents off guard feints become an incredible strategy with the shinobi's kicks. The strikes, more often than naught; can render opponents incapable of continuing the fight, because of the shear force behind the strikes.	3	4	2			33	33	33	22	0	22	0	0	0
939	1	1	Dance of the Mourning Sun	Tsuitou Taiyou no Buyou	Oh ho. Attempting to lift that giant sword now, are we? Practitioners of this stage aren't really classified as swordsmen; instead, they're more accurately described as children or adults wielding swords equal to them in height, and at least twice their weight. Not a pretty picture. Moves are choppy, defense is ridiculous, and the user is hard-pressed to summon the strength to lift the sword over their head-but they seem to be somewhat more agile than another at the same level as them, and it is certain that they can prolong their fights more than the rest. But even these two aspects are limited; they are beginners, after all. Generally at this level, moves are limited to rote attack and defense patterns, but there are very few variations in these as well.		4	5			5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
939	2	2	Dance of the Mourning Sun	Tsuitou Taiyou no Buyou	Continuing on? Please. Even my grandmother could beat you into submission. At this stage, the user increases their stamina and speed once again, and seem to be able to fight slightly longer and a mite faster than those at their level. Their swordplay, however, still seems to be lacking, and there is no end to the awkward moments when dueling with their giant weapons. Constant training, however, has toughened their body to the point where they can wield and swing their weapon somewhat easier than before, and the adept is getting to the point where he can feel comfortable with his weapon. Various attack and defense theories and patterns are added to the user's repertoire, and he is getting used to 'Å“changing it up' to surprise and incapacitate his enemy.		4	5			8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
939	3	3	Dance of the Mourning Sun	Tsuitou Taiyou no Buyou	Getting to the point now, are we? At this stage, the user has become somewhat more comfortable with his or her weapon, eliminating most awkward swings and slices. The practitioner's stamina and speed once again increase with constant training and conditioning. Also, at this stage, a sense of uniqueness and flair is introduced into the kenjutsu aspect of the style; most shinobi have their own strategy and tactics when fighting, and at this point mold their swordplay to fit their personality. Repeated attack and defense theories and patterns have, for now, mostly been memorized, leaving the offensive and defensive moves in battle up to the user for improvisation.		4	5			11	9	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
939	4	4	Dance of the Mourning Sun	Tsuitou Taiyou no Buyou	A regular demon with a sword, they say. At the current level, the user is developing into a true swordsman (or woman). Handling their great sword with ease, they dash about the battlefield in commendable displays of speed and physical prowess, bringing death wherever they may step. Improvisation with the sword has led to the rapid maturation of a unique, personal style; no two users of this style will ever been seen having the same tendencies, attack patterns or strategic maneuvers in battle. The user is also getting to know his sword, its strengths and flaws known as well as the back of his own hand. This being said, the practitioner adapts their kenjutsu to play to their true strengths. Reactions are almost fully developed, with the user being able to fight on par with a swordsman of his level, and react to attacks that might be even slightly quicker than his own.		4	5			17	15	11	0	14	0	0	0	0
939	5	5	Dance of the Mourning Sun	Tsuitou Taiyou no Buyou	Only two bloody steps away from mastery. You've come a long way, hm? With ascension to the fifth level of this style comes an incredible gift of versatility, strength, speed and sword prowess that is unmatched at any previous stage. The great sword, while looking large and unwieldy, has practically become a part of the user. Flourishes, light thrusts, and other techniques that one would've thought only possible with a sword of smaller size are now accessible to practitioners at this stage. Agility and endurance at this level are also quite astounding, letting the user fight prolonged battles of attrition in order to wear out opponents of equal or higher levels.		4	5		Name: Yuuyake (Sunset)Description: The only usage of chakra within this style, this technique allows the user's sword to become a threat to those annoying ninjutsu losers. By charging chakra into the blade, the practitioner can cleave through (basically, nullify) one ninjutsu technique up to a stage one less than the stage of this taijutsu they are proficient in. This can only be done once every 4 willpower per thread, and has a two post cooldown.	22	19	15	0	16	0	0	0	0
939	6	6	Dance of the Mourning Sun	Tsuitou Taiyou no Buyou	Good God, you're nearly there! The sixth stage is a further refinement of the style at the fifth stage. With even further physical conditioning, a new level of endurance and agility has been achieved, and swordplay is almost breath-taking to behold. The user wields their weapon effortlessly, and only one of the same or higher level (and you have to admit, there's not many of those shinobi) could stand a chance at defeating them.		4	5			30	25	20	0	20	16	0	0	0
939	7	7	Dance of the Mourning Sun	Tsuitou Taiyou no Buyou	Oh snap, you've made it. The user is at the summit of the mountain, both physically, mentally, and in terms of swordplay. When they duel, they most certainly exemplify the greatest aspects of kenjutsu. Only one of the same level could hope to defeat them, in any circumstance.		4	5			38	33	28	0	24	20	0	0	0
938	1	1	Well Timed Warrior	Jigi o Eta Senshi	Description: As a beginner, the user is merely a student. He knows how to hold his sword and shield, but they remain heavy in his hands, and fancy displays are a bit beyond him. However, the basic slashes and stabs are all within reach, and his strikes are solid if a little awkward. Blocking with the shield is sluggish and telegraphed, used strictly to defend the user rather than to open the enemy to counter attacks. The user's footwork is good, but still that of a novice, and he can really on keep focused on one target at a time like a duelist.	5		4		Pack MuleSpecial TechniqueA truly Well-Timed Warrior must have the right tool for every situation, even if carrying all that gear is cumbersome, awkward, and not strictly in the spirit of a shinobi and more of a mercenary mindset. Regardless, the user trains to accommodate the weight of all his equipment and comes up with his own method for keeping everything within easy reach. Every time he takes a Well-Timed Warrior special tagged with a weapon type, he gains 1 Item Point, which surpass the standard limit. Pack Mule provides a single Item Point as well.Quick DrawSpecial Technique - Medium or Larger Ballistic WeaponSometimes, a sword and shield just don't have the range a warrior needs. In that instant, he can reach for his trust bow and arrow, holding the bow and sword in one hand while drawing an arrow with his shield arm. This special technique represents the alarming alacrity with which the user can draw his bow, fire, and store the weapon away again, not needing to sheath his sword for even a moment. Quick Draw is typically used to assist a distant teammate or using a surprise arrow at near-melee range on a retreating or advancing enemy.Base Effect: One arrow fired.Stage Two: Two arrows fired at up to two targets.Stage Three: Five arrows fired at up to five targets.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
938	2	2	Well Timed Warrior	Jigi o Eta Senshi	Description: The user has improved a little, mostly in the realm of offense. While shield control remains difficult and rudimentary, the user has more control over the path of his blade. His slashes move faster and hit harder than before, posing a serious danger to anyone in their path. The user is a bit more aware of the battlefield, specifically to take advantage of any openings in an enemy's guard to a swift forward thrust with his sword. He is lighter on his feet, but still sees the battlefield as a one-on-one match.	5		4		ReboundSpecial Technique - Large ProjectileOften performed with a boomerang or chakram, the warrior first throws the weapon at the ground or a nearby wall. With a clank, the weapon bounces off the surface and continues on its way, usually to catch an enemy from an awkward angle. Regardless of whether or not the projectile strikes its intended target, it eventually finds its way back to the warrior's hand, at which point it's stowed away once more. If the warrior can walk on water, the projectile may also bounce off water as though it were a solid surface.Base Effect: One bounce at one target.Stage Three: Three bounces at up to three targets. A single target may be attacked more than once.Stage Four: Five bounces at up to five targets. A single target may be attacked more than once.DisarmSpecial Technique - Soft WeaponPulling a whip or shoge from his waist, the warrior flicks it towards a target, usually an enemy's weapon, but potentially any item on someone else's person. The end of the soft weapon wraps around the target and then, with another flick, the user pulls the item from his enemy's hands and into his waiting palm. This technique sees use mostly as a way to rip dangerous weapons out of their owners' hands, but some less ethical warriors use it to pilfer keyrings from guards and the like.	7	7	0	6	0	0	0	0	0
938	3	3	Well Timed Warrior	Jigi o Eta Senshi	Description: The most marked improvement at this stage is with the user's footwork and perception. The warrior has finally begun to see the big picture and keeps his eyes moving between multiple targets at once: not just his enemies, but his allies as well. He stays on his toes while staying aware of his surroundings to better control not just the target right in front of him, but also assist his comrades in a pinch. To that end, the user's shieldwork is better, too, allowing him to quickly switch between offense and defense without making his play completely obvious.	5		4		DeflectSpecial TechniqueLifting his shield, the warrior defends himself expertly. While a shield is sturdy enough to deflect shuriken, katana, and all manner of other weapons, it takes a certain kind of skill to protect from shinobi ninjutsu or samurai chi techniques. In order to properly use Deflect, the user must remain immobile as an attack approaches, then counterattack it with a swing of his shield just as it gets into range. When performed against an offensive ninjutsu, Deflect creates a roughly circular hole in the attack so it travels past the warrior. Chi techniques and taijutsu specials are essentially absorbed and nullified.Base Effect: Blocks stage two or lower.Stage Four: Blocks stage three or lower.Stage Five: Blocks stage four or lower.Between the EyesSpecial Technique - Small Ballistic WeaponNot every tool in the warrior's arsenal is for taking advantage of an opening - some exist solely to create those openings. Pulling back a slingshot or twirling a leather sling, the user lets fly a stone aimed at the enemy's brow. Hitting the target stuns them briefly, as though affecting the target with a flashbang. Their vision whites out and their ears ring for a full post, which while not disabling, is fairly debilitating. The stone itself doesn't cause much damage.	10	10	0	8	0	0	0	0	0
938	4	4	Well Timed Warrior	Jigi o Eta Senshi	Description: Not so much a departure as an extension of theory. A large part of the Well Timed Warrior's development thus far has been focused upon making them as sturdy as a rock--this stage begins to shift the focus to crafting them to be as fluid as water. Adaptability begins to take precedence with the ability to switch between weapons on the fly given special focus. Timing, more so than the sword and the shield begins to emerge as a third weapon in the style and although far from mastery the user at this stage is deeply familiar with tactics and the need for versatility. This change in mindset has little effect on footwork or the actual skills the user has learned but a marked improvement in fluidity and tactical appraisal is easily seen and more often than not confidently shown.	5		4		Smack DownSpecial Technique - Pole WeaponSlinging a bo or spear off his back, the warrior attacks the opponent's legs. Whether hooking an enemy behind the ankle or falling into a crouch for a wide sweep around them, the user attempts to knock the target to the ground. Once the target is falling, however, the warrior shifts into an immediate follow-up attack, smashing the target with a downward strike with the pole so they hit the ground with tremendous force.Sneak AttackSpecial Technique - Hidden Small BladeOften covered in weapons, the warrior risks tipping his hand to an opponent, and must play some cards close to the heart. Hiding a dagger in his sleeve, strapped to his shield, or even in the pommel of his sword, the warrior waits for the right moment. In an instant, the weapon is drawn, the attack is made, and then the knife is hidden away again. This technique involves such rapid motion that tracking where, exactly, the weapon is lurking is nigh impossible without the use of a doujutsu, allowing the warrior to continually trick the opponent. In truth, the user may choose to hide the blade in a different location on their person at the end of every Sneak Attack.	16	16	11	14	0	0	0	0	0
938	5	5	Well Timed Warrior	Jigi o Eta Senshi	Description: The Well Timed Warrior is often considered to be at the peak of development, dedicated so much to the art of weaponry that their very body has become such. The sword and shield work the user displays at this stage is fundamentally perfect able to switch between offense and defense with little to no effort. The familiarity with battle along with the extensive knowledge of weaponry places them above even the most elite of warriors. Strategically the focus still remains on peerless preparation and opportunistic timing, though personal flair begins to shine even more. This Stage marks a departure from the previous and a promise for the next: the basics are done and mastery awaits.	5		4		Thousand NeedlesSpecial TechniqueSword in hand, the warrior begins a barrage of rapid attacks meant to push the enemy onto the back foot. Thousand Needles takes the form of a dozen quick thrusts that all blur together - this seems to create a cloud of distinct swords all at once. As such, Thousand Needles is difficult to defend against, though the individual striking power of each attack is much lower than normal. Once the flurry has finished, the warrior follows up with a single strong stab meant to capitalize on the target's confusion.Power SlamSpecial Technique - Medium or Larger Blunt WeaponWith both hands, the warrior raises a hammer over his head. As he brings it down, he aims for the ground rather than an opponent. The impact creates a weak shockwave that shakes the earth beneath everyone within twenty feet of the user before the ground dents. A crater sinks into the ground with the user at the center, ten feet at the deepest point, and dropping footing out from under anyone caught unware.	20	20	16	16	0	0	0	0	0
938	6	6	Well Timed Warrior	Jigi o Eta Senshi	Description: One step below mastery. The user seems to radiate experience and skill, able to carefully craft the perfect solution and always know the perfect tool for any situation. The skill with various weaponry has given the user a unique skill set, their knowledge of weapons makes and their uses extend beyond that of inventors and blacksmiths--the user is a true weapon aficionado whose love for battle radiates with their every step. Within battle personal flair, adaptability, and versatility remain the name of the game but a special focus is placed upon defense and shield work. It seems even the toughest blows have a hard time cracking the Well Timed Warrior's defenses and this is no accident, having been shaped and sculpted on the field of battle. This stage serves as a testament to the styles strength and power.	5		4		RedirectSpecial Technique - requires DeflectRather than stand his ground and create a path through an enemy attack, the warrior using this technique instead attempts to wield his opponent's power like one of his own weapons. As an offensive, projectile-style ninjutsu nears, he readies his shield. This time, when he bats it, the attack doesn't dissipate but instead bends. This can be used to alter the course of a ninjutsu by ninety degrees, turning a fireball to the side or sending a lightning bolt into the ground. This consumes an additional technique use equal in stage to the blocked technique, but taijutsu-typed rather than ninjutsu.Base Effect: Stage four or lower ninjutsu redirected.Strength 33: Stage five or lower ninjutsu redirected.Strength 40: Stage six or lower ninjutsu redirected.Great CleaveSpecial Technique - Large Axe or Oversized BladeThe warrior reaches for one of the biggest weapons they carry. With both hands, the user takes a single wild swing either horizontally or vertically. A horizontal strike covers a complete arc in front of the warrior and moves with enough force to easily chop trees in half on the way, sometimes used as a way to make a flash entrance. A vertical strike comes crashing down and creates a fissure in the earth that continues up to thirty feet in front of the user, catching the feet of targets beyond the normal range of the weapon, and usually killing anyone caught by the blade itself.	26	26	23	20	0	16	0	0	0
938	7	7	Well Timed Warrior	Jigi o Eta Senshi	Description: A true warlord, if not a sentient weapon of mass destruction. The user at this stage is peerless in their dedication to the path of steel and blood. Their style often impetuous, their defense impregnable--the skill of the user is often something seen within legend. An immovable object and an unstoppable force rolled into one convenient package. Moving with the the expert timing of a master dancer and with the same deadly ability as a master assassin. The Well Timed Warrior at this stage serves more than a testament to this style--but as a testament to the art of war in general. Head and shoulders above the pack and ready to respond to any situation with unrelenting strength and a storm of swords.	5		4		HurricaneSpecial TechniqueThe warrior draws his standard sword across his body and holds it to the side, straight out. With a bit of fancy footwork and a lot of power, he spins on his axis twice, making full rotations. This attack has such force behind it that nearby targets are pulled towards him as he spins - anyone within ten feet of the user is dragged closer as if pulled by the user's full Strength. The spin itself is dangerous as well, slicing unimpeded. Once both rotations are over, targets that had been pulled in are then knocked back out to the edge of the ten foot radius.Combined ArmsSpecial TechniqueA simple technique that enables all-out offense from the warrior. When using Combined Arms, the user sacrifices his second action that post, but uses three Well-Timed Warrior special techniques. These attacks are generally chained together and the user may select the same technique multiple times. He must pay usages for each ability used in addition to the Stage Seven usage from Combined Arms. This technique has a one post cooldown.	37	37	25	24	0	20	0	0	0
937	1	1	Spinning Steel Whirlwind 	Bouseki Kotetsu Senpuu-Ryu	Attack Speed: The student of this style does not attack terribly quickly at this stage, either. Occasionally, they will worry about making the occasional flurry of blows, but for the most part, there's not too much going down here either.Attack Power: The attack power here is not significantly greater than cutting with a standard knife.Evasion: Evasion is perhaps the most emphasized part of the training here. No teacher wants their student to die prematurely. As a result, teachers focus almost exclusively on raising the student's agility and ability to avoid attacks. It's not exactly easy for a fighter of similar skill to land a blow on the user.Blocking: On weapon blocking, there is one fundamental tenet for the user at this stage: Don't do it. The user at this stage is simply too inexperienced to effectively block with small weapons like the ones used in this style. Dodging whenever possible is recommended.Stances: There are no stances that emphasize any specific method of combat in this style whatsoever. The time it would take to adopt a stance is time that could be used to deliver a flurry of attacks.	2	5	2	Name: Nibai Kiru (Double Cut)Description: Simply put, the user attacks from two different angles with both swords simultaneously. Against someone wielding a single weapon, this can make it very difficult to parry.		0	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
937	2	2	Spinning Steel Whirlwind 	Bouseki Kotetsu Senpuu-Ryu	Attack Speed: Now, attacks are much more fluid and quick. The student at this level can unleash a fairly long chain of blows without getting too tired. This allows one who uses this style to pretty constantly stay on the defensive.Attack Power: Power improves slightly, but it's still not all too great.Evasion: Mobility increases more at this stage. The user's movements flow quite smoothly, and against slower combatants, constantly avoiding attacks is not very difficult. Survival is still the most important thing for students at this stage to learn, and not getting hit is still the best way for them to do it. Indeed, part of the training students are expected to do at this stage is fight without standing still at all, even when sparring partners have been knocked to the ground or something like that. This is mostly done to keep the feet loose and ready.Blocking: Now, the student is taught a bit more how to parry attacks effectively with the shorter weapons; namely, slapping the attacks to the side with one or both blades and moving.	2	5	2	Name: Gyakujou: Go (Frenzy: Five)Description: This technique is not all too elaborate. Essentially, the user performs five strikes exceptionally quickly in an attempt to pierce the opponent's defenses, exerting a great deal of stamina in order to deliver several blows in an instant.		0	10	4	0	0	6	0	0	0
937	3	3	Spinning Steel Whirlwind 	Bouseki Kotetsu Senpuu-Ryu	Attack Speed: The user is now able to comimit fairly competently to offense. The user's attacks whistle quickly through the air, and he is fairly readily able to hold the blade in both a standard and reverse grip to allow from an attack from virtually any angle.Attack Power: Power improves insignificantly.Evasion: Mobility is again, fairly increased. Dodging is still the primary focus of this style.Blocking: The user becomes better still at defense. Namely, the training for catching at attack between both blades and then countering is introduced here. This is, more or less, the highest extent of the training in blocking, however.	2	5	2	Name: Senpuu Benkai (Whirlwind Defense)Description: The user holds both swords in front of themself and twirls them rapidly. The twirling blades allow the user to fairly easily deflect slow-moving projectiles coming at him. Faster projectiles will likely penetrate the defense, simply because the user is not well-versed in the spinning at this stage.Name: Gyakujou: Juu (Frenzy: Ten)Description: This technique is not all too elaborate. Essentially, the user performs ten strikes exceptionally quickly in an attempt to pierce the opponent's defenses, exerting a great deal of stamina in order to deliver several blows in an instant.Name: Meimei-ken: Ichi (Invisible Blade: One)Description: A fairly innocuous technique, this technique entails stabbing at the opponet while, at the same time, throwing a weapon in such a way that the attack obscures it (generally at a vulnerable area), aiming to hit them while they are distracted. Essentially, it is a not-so-elaborate feint.		0	14	6	0	0	8	0	0	0
937	4	4	Spinning Steel Whirlwind 	Bouseki Kotetsu Senpuu-Ryu	Attack Speed: Here ends the emphasis of using speed for defense on the part of the user of this style. Now, the offensive underpinnings emerge as the speed of attacks and rate at which they are linked together increase dramatically. The user's hands are generally quite difficult to follow for slower fighters, and many a feint is used to disorient them. Also, occasionally are kicks used to distract or off-balance an opponent.Attack Power: Power improves insignificantly, as usual.Evasion: Mobility is again, fairly increased, but no longer is the emphasis not getting hit. The emphasis of the style is now to get in as close as possible, minimizing damage. Rapid lunges, jumps, and jukes are practiced to get the user up close and doing damage as soon as possible.Blocking: Blocking ability improves all-around only slightly.	2	5	2	Name: Senpuu Benkai (Whirlwind Defense)Description: The user holds both swords in front of themself and twirls them rapidly. The twirling blades allow the user to fairly easily deflect projectiles coming at him from inexperienced shots. More experienced archers/gunners/whatever can still probably pierce this defense easily.Name: Gyakujou: Nijuu (Frenzy: Twenty)Description: This technique is not all too elaborate. Essentially, the user performs twenty strikes exceptionally quickly, so quickly that their hands almost seem to blur, in an attempt to pierce the opponent's defenses, exerting a fair deal of stamina in order to deliver several blows in an instant.		12	18	13	0	0	14	0	0	0
937	5	5	Spinning Steel Whirlwind 	Bouseki Kotetsu Senpuu-Ryu	Attack Speed: Now the speed at which the user attacks is truly intimidating. Even the more dramatic movements by the user of this style moves with incredible speed. The relative weakness of the user is completely overshadowed by the fact that they can land three or four strikes in the time it would take someone with a larger weapon to land one by making small jabs and slices. Furthermore, at this point, a small degree of anatomical study is introduced, mostly to aid simply in knowing where to best place the attacks. This knowledge is more to the extent of "It hurts more if you stab them here," and its academic applications are minimal at best.Attack Power: Power doesn't even really improve here.Evasion: The user's mobility increases yet further. Now, the user hardly ever appears to merely step across the ground, hopping, flipping, and twirling like an acrobat while moving, distracting, disorienting, and infuriating opponents. At this point, striking them is very difficult unless fighting with a similarly agile style.Blocking: Yet again, blocking ability improves all-around only slightly.	2	5	2	Name: Senpuu Benkai (Whirlwind Defense)Description: The user holds both swords in front of themself and twirls them rapidly. The twirling blades allow the user to fairly easily deflect projectiles coming at him from even fairly competent attackers. Ranged attackers of a similar level of experience will still probably be able to penetrate this defense, though.Name: Gyakujou: Sanjyuu (Frenzy: Thirty)Description: This technique is not all too elaborate. Essentially, the user performs thirty strikes exceptionally quickly, so quickly that their hands are little more than a blur, in an attempt to pierce the opponent's defenses, exerting a fair deal of stamina in order to deliver several blows in an instant.Name: Meimei-ken: Ni (Invisible Blade: Two)Description: An extremely fancy feint, this technique entails attacking while rapidly spinning, moving so quickly that the blades are essentially blurred to the point of near-invisibility and simply blend in with the fluttering clothes of the spinning user.		15	23	18	0	0	16	0	0	0
937	6	6	Spinning Steel Whirlwind 	Bouseki Kotetsu Senpuu-Ryu	Attack Speed: The speed at which the user attacks increases still more. To put things bluntly, the user has reached the point of being pretty darn fast.Attack Power: Power doesn't even really improve here.Evasion: Mobility is still faster at this stage. The user now learns to crouch while moving to minimalize the size of his body and make his motions all the more surprising, just to add a bit more shock value to the style.Blocking: Yet again, blocking ability improves all-around only slightly.	2	5	2	Name: Senpuu Benkai (Whirlwind Defense)Description: The user holds both swords in front of themself and twirls them rapidly while spinning himself. This defense is no more effective, really, than the Senpuu Benkai of level five, but it allows him to deflect missiles from all around as opposed to from in front.Name: Gyakujou: Yonjyuu (Frenzy: Forty)Description: This technique is not all too elaborate. Essentially, the user performs forty strikes exceptionally quickly, so quickly that their arms appear to almost disappear from the speed of the striking, in an attempt to pierce the opponent's defenses, exerting a fair deal of stamina in order to deliver several blows in an instant.		21	30	24	0	16	20	0	0	0
937	7	7	Spinning Steel Whirlwind 	Bouseki Kotetsu Senpuu-Ryu	Attack Speed: Essentially, speed reaches its apex here. The user gets faster still, but there's not too much more to say.Attack Power: The user's strength does increase slightly at this stage, as they have essentially mastered the style.Evasion: Again, speed increases slightly. However, there is nothing new worth describing.Blocking: Yet again, blocking ability improves all-around only slightly.Regular Techniques: There are no 'regular techniques' at this stage. This stage entails personal mastery of the style; as a result, all 'regular techniques' should generally be the inventions of the user.	2	5	2			26	35	28	0	20	24	0	0	0
936	1	1	Universal Great Sword	Danbira no Kyo	At this level the user is noticeably better off than someone who has never touched a large sword before, but there's still room for much improvement. He cannot yet properly control the sword, and misjudged swings or stabs will upset his sense of balance, sometimes even knock himself over in the process. It takes literally seconds (which are a long time for shinobi) to recover from an attempted attack to launch another one. When running, the blade hovers bare inches above the ground, and footwork is so sloppy a spectator can't relate the user's movements to this style yet. It is pretty much necessary for the shinobi to wield the sword using both hands to pull off effective moves.	4	5		Shasen (Basic Slash)Description: This is the basic slash of Danbira no Kyo. The person uses his arm power to slash the opponent up, down, left, or right, using sheer physical power and concentration.Suiryoku (Basic Thrust)Description: This is a technique that uses brute force to thrust the huge sword at an opponent. The thrust is begun with a sprint or a solid stance, and then the sword is placed at a straight horizontal angle and forced into the torso of the opponent.	Gibbous Kaika (Gibbous Bloom)Description: The user raises a clenched fist which begins to glow with a soft light that functions identically to real moonlight for the purposes of Danbira skills. This move is used relentlessly in the Danbira style, since moonlight is needed for all of the special skills. Once the technique is initiated, it does not end until the user wishes it so. This cannot be performed in the same post as another Danbira attack.Mikazuki (Crescent Moon)Requires: MoonlightDescription: The most basic Great Sword attack. This technique has the user charge the tip of their blade with chakra and moonlight, then sweep twice, once down, once up, in an interlocking C-shape looking like a crescent moon. If an enemy comes into contact with the tip of the blade while the technique is in progress, his skin will be marked with a pale white line that burns like a bad rash while that area is exposed to moonlight. The effect lasts until the end of the thread.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
936	2	2	Universal Great Sword	Danbira no Kyo	Control has improved to where the user is able to hold his ground after completing a swing or stab so that he does not topple over from his sword's momentum. If the direction in which his successive attack is the same as his first, he is able to execute it with little trouble, but switching directions in combat is still difficult to pull off. At this level the shinobi is comfortable enough to hold his sword higher when running, about shoulder-level, and training with footwork is starting to show: when watching a Danbira no Kyo user dodge, he seems to be using small jumps and steps to dance out of the way of an attack while holding his blade steady. It is possible to wield the sword for short lengths of time using one hand now, but the user will tire quickly.	4	5		Heitan no Danbira (Flat of the Blade)Description: This move uses the flat of the blade to slap the opponent or stop him from running. The blade is positioned horizontally, with the blade up on both sides. The idea is to use the blade to slam into the opponent's torso, limbs and/or face.Kirimomi Wangetsu (Spinning Crescent)Description: By spinning oneself with the blade thrust outward, the user can slash things along the way or damage multiple enemies. This style requires a sprint to start and endurance to hold the spin. Visibility is poor while the user performs the technique, and he may be a bit dizzy after finishing.	Kinpa Gaien (Moonlight Edge)Requires: MoonlightDescription: The user employs their chakra to attract ambient moonlight to the edge of their blade. Concentrated moonlight generates some heat (not as much as concentrated sunlight) and allows the blade to slice through objects with a slight burning effect.	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
936	3	3	Universal Great Sword	Danbira no Kyo	Awkwardness with the sword has almost been eliminated now, with just a few rare moments where the user may be left wide open to a counter because he overestimated how much force he needed for an attack. It is possible to change directions from slash to slash, but rather than trying to execute those rather ineffective kinds of blows, the user rolls into the momentum of his first attack and varies between swipes and stabs. The shinobi can hold his sword at any level or angle while running, and often swallows distance between himself and the target with long jumps, utilizing the short-step pattern to get within good attacking range and stay there if the opponent attempts to get away. Like the last stage, he can hold the sword with one hand for very brief lengths of time, but is still using both hands to fight for the most part.	4	5		Gyutto Shasen (Hard Slash)Description: This attack consists of two parts; a sweeping horizontal slash followed immediately by a quick, lunging thrust.Kurosu Shasen (Cross Slash)Description: This technique is designed to bring added speed to what are usually slow, powerful attacks. The user first performs a horizontal slash, then immediately follows up with an uppercut. The attack as a whole can be performed in the time it normally takes the user to perform a single slash.	Hantsuki Shasen (Half Moon Slash)Requires: MoonlightDescription: The user first gathers moonlight along the edges of their blade, then performs a slow downward slice that is easily avoidable. When the blade reaches the bottom of its descent, the user performs a fast, lunging uppercut along the same line the sword took on its descent. The quick change in speed can easily catch opponents off guard. Additionally, the moonlight collected on the sword will flash, distracting enemies when the user attacks the second time.Getsuei Suiryoku (Moonbeam Thrust)Requires: MoonlightDescription: The user gathers moonlight along their blade and beyond the tip, effectively extending their blade by three inches with the extension being a brightly glowing mass of chakra and moonlight. This moon-chakra edge also brings a heat element to the sword attacks, like Kinpa Gaien.	10	10	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
936	4	4	Universal Great Sword	Danbira no Kyo	The enemy will be incredibly lucky to catch the user fighting with any sort of unwieldy movement at this level. Losing one's balance because of a badly attempted attack just doesn't happen anymore, and he has become good enough with the sword to execute multiple slashes in chain succession with good speed, whether they are in conflicting directions or follow along the same momentum that can be manipulated to fit the sequence of strikes. In addition to leaping movements in close combat, the user also adds a sliding aspect to his short-steps; he digs his feet into the ground when he moves, pressing his body to the floor so that as he shifts, he can brace himself against the sword's weight and not upset his balance. It is common to see the shinobi at this level holding the sword with one hand about half the time in combat.	4	5		Pechanko Ichigeki (Flat Blow)Description: The user's strength is well-developed, allowing them to move their blade sideways through the air with ease, effectively ignoring air resistance. The user performs a simple horizontal slash with the flat of their blade, doing little real damage, but carrying significant power. The blade's movement builds a small shockwave around the blade, so even should the target manage to dodge, if they come within 2-3 inches of the blade, they'll be knocked breathless. A successful hit will send the target flying as well as stun them for a moment.Takameru Suiryoku (Lift Thrust)Description: The user gathers moonlight along their blade, then performs a fast, flat uppercut slash that isn't intended to connect with an enemy. This slash creates a hard updraft of air capable of lifting nearby enemies off the ground. While the enemy is in the air, the user rushes in and thrusts skyward with the sword.	Sanjuu Wangetsu (Triple Crescent)Requires: MoonlightDescription: The user charges their blade's edge with moonlight, then performs three quick attacks. The user begins by performing two quick slashes, one horizontal, then one vertical, followed by a lunging thrust forward. With each blow, the user channels more moonlight into the tip of their blade, lengthening it on the fly. The first attack is performed with roughly two extra inches, the second attack with four, and the final attack with up to six.	18	15	10	0	14	0	0	0	0
936	5	5	Universal Great Sword	Danbira no Kyo	There is little basic difference between this stage and the last; the user moves so well to a watcher it will appear that fighting with a big sword is really not as difficult as it initially sounds. But this is simply a demonstration of how far the disciple has improved; for him wielding his weapon is as easy as a katana user wielding his. The shinobi fights predominately with one hand holding his sword, and uses the other to block, distract, or in rare cases form half-seals for special jutsu or setting off explosion tags. He is even strong enough to twirl the blade around his body like a master of smaller blade weapons might do.	4	5		Bouseki Hirateuchi (Spinning Slap)Description: An advanced version of Flat Blow, this carries all the same effects, but allows the user to spin in a circle instead of merely slashing the blade in front of them. The added speed from spinning strengthens the effect, such that the shockwave now extends up to 6 inches.	Kumoi no Suiryoku (Sky Thrust)Requires: MoonlightDescription: Similar to Lift Thrust, the user first charges moonlight into the sword and then sends an uppercut at the enemy. However, with the technique, the user cuts with the edge of their blade, intending to injure the enemy. The sweep's speed creates an updraft identical to Lift Thrust so regardless of whether the uppercut connects, the enemy will be thrown skyward. Finally, as with Lift Thrust, the user runs to stand beneath their enemy and thrusts upward, manipulating the moonlight edge of their blade to extend the blade by up to six inches, as per Moonbeam Thrust.	25	19	12	0	16	0	0	0	0
936	6	6	Universal Great Sword	Danbira no Kyo	The user at this level is incredibly light-footed for one who fights with such a large weapon, and the system of quick-steps really shines here. Logic would dictate that someone trying to change direction and his attack pattern so swiftly while carrying a big sword would invariably trip, but the shinobi never does. His movements are almost fairy-beautiful (his power scary-deadly), graceful, with no wasted momentum. He relies heavily on chaining his attacks, launching them one after the other before his opponent can recover from dodging such an intimidating weapon. A user at this stage of proficiency can hold and battle one-handed for the entire duration of the fight if desired.	4	5		Koui no Suiryoku (Celestial Thrust)Description: The user rushes forward and performs an uppercut with the edge of their blade, creating an updraft that sends an enemy 10 feet or so skyward. The user leaps as soon as the slash is complete, performing an overhand, flat-blade slash that slaps the enemy back down toward the ground. The user then quickly dives downward, thrusting their blade forward as they land to catch the enemy and spear him into the floor.	Meigetsu (New Moon)Requires: MoonlightDescription: As with Crescent Moon, the user gathers moonlight onto his sword with chakra. The concentrated moonlight generates a heat effect that will badly burn the enemy if he is cut, and a soft white glow will surround each wound, searing the area while it is exposed to moonlight. The effect lasts until the end of the thread.	32	25	18	0	20	16	0	0	0
936	7	7	Universal Great Sword	Danbira no Kyo	This is the highest form of Danbira no Kyo. A true master of the style has an uncanny ability to make it seem as though his large sword weighs nothing at all, that moving with it takes zero effort, and that to pause even once in his presence means agonizing defeat. In addition to the usual lunges and slashes, the shinobi mixes blade twirling with his quick-steps to come onto a target like some demented forest shredder. Few can challenge the user at this stage, and even fewer dare try.	4	5			Getsumei no Gisei (Moonlight Sacrifice)Requires: MoonlightDescription: The ultimate technique of Danbira, this calls for such a concentrated amount of moonlight on the sword's edge that the heat element allows the user to shave through rocks like a hot knife through butter. Additionally, everywhere the blade touches, small -moon flames' are left behind that will continue to burn for three posts after the execution of this attack, presenting both user and opponent with the threat of a white burn that continually sears as long as the area is exposed to moonlight.	40	33	26	0	25	19	0	0	0
935	1	1	Multiple Sword Style	Baisuu Tou Ryuu	At this meager introductory stage, the user at max is only skilled at swinging around a sword, attempting to seem like they know what they're doing. The person doesn't even know how to properly use two swords and can only use one sword without cutting himself.	5	4		It-Tou-Ryuu: Iai (One-Sword-Style, Draw)A very rudimentary technique for a very basic beginning; the user with his sword sheathed rapidly draws his sword for a striking, fast attack, before once again sheathing their sword. The speed of this attack differs depending on different variables, such as what rank the user is, and how far they excel in the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu.	AficionadoWielding multiple swords means learning how to carry them all, and how to tell a good sword from a bad one. The user's interest in blades, whether obsessive or just a little nerdy, prompts them to keep as many as possible on them at all times. Upon taking this technique, the user receives a single Item Point, which must be spent on a sword. Whenever the user obtains a new stage in this style, they receive an additional Item Point for swords, and can reallocate points given by this technique between threads. Maximum seven Item Points.Tou Gappei (Sword Merge)This must be used with more than one sword. The user takes two (or more) swords and merges the hilts together, but not the blades (as in two blades side by side, or both of the blades on opposite ends of one hilt. The effect is that two (or more) swords are able to be used as one. The highest number of swords that can be used is five. The amount of time the swords can be used is described by the formula t = (P+R)/(n) where P equals the user's Power, R equals the user's Reserves, and n equals the number of swords the user wishes to merge. The number t is rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
935	2	2	Multiple Sword Style	Baisuu Tou Ryuu	The basis of the Multiple Sword Style kicks in at this stage, allowing the user to easily use two swords at a time; no risk of fumbling around or accidentally cutting off their arms (as long as more swords aren't added). Their natural fighting style is a little bit brutish, but effective.	5	4		DiscardThis technique is mainly used in a true, up and close, one on one battle. When locking weapons with an enemy, the user simply shifts their strength, weight, and swords slightly, which casually throws off the opponent's weapon, opening him or her up for a strike.	Wadou Ichimonji (The One Road of Harmony)A skilled swordsman can learn all from just listening to what their sword has to say. An even better one can learn a lot more from listening to the weapons of their enemy. Once the user has blocked or parried at least one attack from the opponent, they become fully aware of what, if any, Taijutsu Style he or she is taking. In addition, anything special from the weapon is also revealed.	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
935	3	3	Multiple Sword Style	Baisuu Tou Ryuu	More swords are added to the user's arsenal, bringing the total number of swords that can be safely and fluidly wielded up to four different swords. Tou Gappei or special handling of the swords is necessary to establish this, however. The practitioner's fighting style has become less brutish in this stage and just more forceful, showing off that immense strength of theirs but in a way that catches the opponent off guard.	5	4		Ichi Ton Keishu (One Ton Guard)This technique requires at least three swords to perform. With a sword in each hand and one in their mouth, the user stretches one arm behind them, resting the blade just a few inches away from their back, and the other across the front of their body, allowing the blade to sit comfortably next to their side. This three sword defense acts like a trigger, allowing quick and immediate action after any hostile action against the user. This technique is sometimes followed by the user closing his or her eyes, since it's a useful technique when you are robbed of your senses due to smoke, blindness, or any type of 'Å“hidden' Ninjutsu or Genjutsu.	Nana-Jyuu-Ni Pondo Hou (72 Pound Cannon)A Ni-Tou-Ryuu (Two-Sword-Style) technique that uses the practitioner's immense strength with this style to cut fissures into the air itself. Cutting the air with two swords, the user sends a strong vacuumed pocket of air spiraling towards his opponent. It has zero strength behind it, but does retain the exact sharpness of the two blades, being able to easily create cuts and gashes on the enemy. It has a range of half the user's Strength in yards.	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
935	4	4	Multiple Sword Style	Baisuu Tou Ryuu	The maximum amount of swords used is now increased to five. At this level, the user should be using at least two swords on average. If a practitioner is ever to be found using only one sword, it should only be because of two possible things: they are in the middle of training, or they're going soft and easy on an opponent. At this level of the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu, the style of fighting levels off. They maintain a fierce fighting aura and will seldom hesitate to fight to their fullest. It is here where the user begins to develop a certain sense of style and flair, blending his or her own experiences to create their own personalized fighting style.	5	4		Lucky Catch		19	16	8	0	14	0	0	0	0
935	5	5	Multiple Sword Style	Baisuu Tou Ryuu	Aside form being able to use six swords at one time with extreme ease, not much has changed since Stage Four. The user would be developing their own unique sense of style by this time, not wanting to be washed away in a sea of mediocre swordsmen. The only real thing that continues to stick with the practitioner is their natural fury and ferocity displayed throughout the style.	5	4		Nigiri (Double Cut)At this level of the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu, the user is already suited to using speed to creating shadowy afterimages of himself or herself, confusing the opponent. This technique plays off that focus slightly. Using their speed, the user feigns a slash at an opponent, creating a false image of a sword closing into steal some blood. When the opponent thinks he or she is able to block it or dodge it, the real strike occurs; either overpowering their attempt at a block or striking someplace else that is more vulnerable. This can be used with any amount of swords.	Shishi Sonson (Lion's Song)There are times when even supernatural weapons fail to perform their duties. Legendary Blades that are supposed to cut everything in their path just don't... well, cut it. The Shishi Sonson is a high level Iaijutsu which can be used with one or two swords. A prerequisite to this technique is that the practitioner had to at least block or parry a blow from an opponent or land a physical blow onto the opponent himself (following up on the Wadou Ichimonji). Performing a quick Iai coupled with their speed, the user can cut apart any metal or non-metal in his or her path, even Ninjutsu Defenses of a lower Ninjutsu Stage to the user's highest stage in the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu.	25	19	12	0	16	0	0	0	0
935	6	6	Multiple Sword Style	Baisuu Tou Ryuu	The fierceness and fiery spirit of the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu Swordsman persists once again as the number of swords the user is able to use is increased to eight swords at one time. At this point, there are no two practitioners of this style that are exactly the same, except for a minor case between Master and Student. Nothing much is left for the practitioner to learn, as they are already practically experts in their field.	5	4			This is an ultimate defense a Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu fighter has against Ninjutsu that is at a stage equal to the fighter's highest stage minus two. They literally cut into any oncoming Ninjutsu and in a powerful clash of steel and chakra, send it flying back towards the one that fired off that technique. This doesn't make clones attack their owners, though, and Defensive Jutsu just crumbles.	30	24	21	0	21	15	0	0	0
935	7	7	Multiple Sword Style	Baisuu Tou Ryuu	The Pinnacle of the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu is quite possibly the Pinnacle of all the Sword Styles in the world. A Multiple Swords fighter is practically unrivaled in the field of swordsmanship. Their brute power and insane speed make them powerful forces to be reckoned with. If they ever draw their swords on you, run far and run fast. With the possibility of ten razor edges unsheathed at your throat, you had better never hope to cross paths with this man again.	5	4			AsuraThis is a horrifying technique few enemies have seen and lived to tell about it. This immediately increases the Swordsman's fighting power threefold. Two 'Å“clones' are formed on both sides of the user, creating a figure with the likeness of a demon. Whatever number of swords the user was wielding in this form is also multiplied, making this a technique that can be considered to be in the range of the Sanjyuu-Tou-Ryuu. This technique lasts for three posts and any technique at all in the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu arsenal can be used with this with the same amount of power.These clones are only capable of knowing the Baisuu-Tou-Ryuu, so any other Taijutsu style the user has will not carry over, and the user will be unable to use Ninjutsu of any kind in this technique. Because of its destructive nature, it can only be used once per thread and when the three posts are up, they disappear immediately.	40	34	25	0	25	19	0	0	0
934	1	1	Hidden Fist	Onken	The most basic combat methods are trained here, along with the muscle movements necessary to trigger a Hidden Blade's extension and retractions. The bread and butter of fighting involves throwing seemingly mundane and easy to block punches, kicks, elbows, etc, then extending the blades to do damage when the opponent doesn't expect it. Done properly an unsuspecting target might not even be aware the user is armed, though most novices at this stage struggle to keep their weapons properly concealed when striking. While the novice is still full of openings, they are taught the best ways to exploit an opponent looking to take advantage of those openings.		5	4	Pickpocket:Classic technique where by providing a distraction the user moves an object from one place to another. Used most often for theft, but in combat lets the user move items or weapons around on their person without being noticed.Joint Dislocation:Useful for getting out of restraints around the limbs, the user can pop joints out to squeeze themselves through tighter spaces, then pop them back into place afterwards. This is very hard on the body, and causes significant pain even to experienced users. Commonly causes joint problems later in life if abused.	Duplication:Passive. Every Hidden Blade purchased comes in a pair at no extra cost. Only works on mundane Hidden Blades with no other modifiers.Palming:Any item which could be concealed in a closed fist may be palmed/otherwise tucked away onto the user's person, effectively granting it the Hidden modifier, and preventing even astute observers from knowing where the item went. This modifier lasts until the item is revealed again. Two items (one per fist) may be hidden this way per post.False Cut:Passive. The user may decide to have damage they inflict be painless and unnoticeable for several posts, up to the maximum Stage they know in this list. No signs of damage (bleeding, cuts, etc) appear until the duration of this technique ends. Medical techniques can still identify and fix the wounds otherwise. This delayed damage can apply to both inanimate and living targets.	0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
934	2	2	Hidden Fist	Onken	In addition to improved combat prowess, the Onken practitioner begins learning the craftsmanship necessary to maintain their weapons of choice. Simple spring mechanisms are now easily constructed, which forms the foundation of many tricks and traps common across many shinobi disciplines and magicians alike. This also marks the start of the more scholarly side of Onken, where users begin learning the most common weaknesses to exploit in potential targets.		5	4	Corkscrew:Hidden Blades with detachable handles allow the user to stab their weapon into a target, then twist it in such a way that the blade remains stuck inside the target after separating from the handle. These blades are difficult to remove without medical training, but continue to cause damage as the target moves around with them stuck inside.Disappearing Liquid:The user can cut themselves or another target capable of bleeding in a precise way, which causes an accurate spray of blood to hit another target within 10 feet.Breathing Technique:The user passively learns to breathe without making a sound. They also become much more attuned to the sound of breathing from others, though this isn't a supernatural sense and only lets them be aware that someone, somewhere within 10 feet of them is breathing, and only if that person isn't trying to hide their own presence through either mundane or supernatural means.	Lucky Rabbit's Foot:Makibishi/caltops are hidden in the user's footwear, which may extend out tiny barbs from the bottom of their feet when they manipulate their foot a certain way. This causes additional damage when kicking, but also improves grip, allows for protection against slipping, and makes it easier to climb certain materials. The caltrops can also be released at will to leave a trail of metal spikes in their wake. If an entire post is taken and the user has the proper materials, they may modify existing footwear to have this technique as well.Butterfly Knife:Owned Hidden Blades may have the Extended modifier for free.Gut Punch:By stiffening the muscles and anticipating an attack, the user may improve their resilience to blows which they know are coming. This only works if the user has observed their opponent for long enough to learn what to expect. Every 2 posts in combat against one target, the user may lessen the force of a physical blow they take from that target, equivalent to wearing another layer of leather armor. This can stack indefinitely, but all benefits are consumed after being hit once.	0	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0
934	3	3	Hidden Fist	Onken	At this point the ins and outs of fighting are considered functional enough that the Onken practitioner can begin working on the arts of deception rather than melee combat. It's not uncommon for those who reach this level to take up a '˜front' act as a disguise, such as being a street performer, magician, musician, acrobat, etc. The idea here is the same as before- provide a distraction to avoid detection, and strike when it is least expected.		5	4	Fitted Suit:The user modifies their own clothes so that passively any hidden weapons which burst out of them can be retracted without damaging the clothing. Effectively grants the user's clothing (not armor or other purchased items) immunity from being cut by their own weapons.Counterfeits:The user learns to manufacture knock-off versions of generic objects. Most often this is used to create fake currency, but occasionally it is used to make bootleg versions of fancy branded products. The counterfeits are revealed to be fake upon inspection, but at a glance will look real enough. Typically used as a distraction by throwing handfuls of what looks like money into the air.Highwire Act:When dodging any attack which comes from below themselves, the user gains an extra 1 Speed Level solely for the purposes of dodging.	Switch Blade:Owned hidden Blades may have the Morph modifier for free, and morph into any 0 cost projectile.Jack in the Box:A spring loaded Hidden Blade is tucked away somewhere on the user's body. By flexing a certain muscle, the mechanism activates, and the Hidden Blade fires out from beneath their clothes in a general direction like a projectile. This technique does not consume an action to use, but may only be used twice per thread.Cups and Balls: Somehow, through trickery or real magic, objects as big as the user's head can be compressed to a size that is concealable in their clenched fist. Enough dirt or sand can be compressed this way to create a cloud of smoke when released all at once, for a single post. Only applies to inanimate objects.	0	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0
934	4	4	Hidden Fist	Onken	The more esoteric arts of Onken are learned at this stage, with both the complexity of the tricks increasing alongside the depth of preparation taken before engaging a target. It's considered poor form to get into straight up fair fights; the Onken student is instead expected to rely on schemes and feints to get the upper hand, rather than raw combat skill or power.		5	4	Shill:Through the secretive network of magicians, street performers, and court entertainers, the user acquires the ability to hire professional conspirators to aid in their work. Once per thread any unnamed NPC may be revealed to have been working for the user the whole time, though they will only ever assist in a non-combat capacity.Bullet Catch:By consuming both kawarimi usages for the thread, the user may stop any physical attack with their body without sustaining damage. Typically this involves some kind of setup, trickery, or deception, though if the incoming attack is weak enough the user may manage to stop it through raw force alone.Metamorphosis:Any mundane item that could be found in a shinobi kit may be instantly revealed to have been a Hidden Blade all along. Effectively grants the Morph [Hidden Blade] modifier to 0 point items, provided it would make sense they could turn into a Hidden Blade of some kind. The user must have unrevealed Hidden Blades in their possession to use this technique, as this does not generate new weapons, and merely hides the ones the user already possesses.	Magnetic Knife:Owned Hidden Blades may have the Tracer modifier for free.False Transfer:A one-handed weapon can perform an attack, then instantly be transferred into the other hand to perform another attack, all in a single post. If a Hidden Blade is used, this can be done twice per post.Threading the Needle:If a post is spent studying an armored or difficult to damage target, the user can discover a weak point in the target that will cause more damage in the next post. If the user has been fighting or observing at target for at least 2 posts, they may grant one attack an extra 1 Level of Strength. This can stack for every 2 additional posts of observation/fighting. The entire bonus is consumed after performing one attack.	7	20	16	0	0	14	0	0	0
934	5	5	Hidden Fist	Onken	Having been in the '˜business' this long, those practitioners reaching this stage have learned to hide not just their weapons and intentions, but their skills as well. The art of looking like a novice is mastered here, such that the user can fake using any universal taijutsu style at a Stage One level completely convincingly. Since they are only pretending, no bonuses or techniques from the style can be used- it's only a front. Of course the goal is to draw an opponent under false pretenses to then dispatch them much easier, so care must be taken not to leave oneself too exposed.		5	4	Insurance Fraud:Using a variety of tools such as fake blood (and sometimes real blood) and extensive acting lessons, the user can sell the idea that they've taken more damage than they really have. The user can reveal that a severe wound they seemed to have sustained was actually a trick, and that they are unharmed or not quite as injured as they made it appear.Sword Swallow:Typically used for spectacle, this technique lets the user safely swallow and then '˜retrieve' any object they can reasonably fit in their mouth. Any item in their inventory (that makes sense) can be stored this way and spit/fired out if desired.Rainy Day Fund:Any post after missing a special or regular technique from this list, the user may reveal an additional free Hidden Blade on their person. These extra Hidden Blades break after being used once. One post cooldown.	Body Piercing:Adapted from a dangerous act performed by a famous magician, the user may survive with minimal damage being impaled once per thread. The exact mechanism of this trick is a closely guarded secret, but even blows to the head or heart can seemingly be survived through this technique.Hand Buzzer:Owned Hidden Blades may have the Trick Lock modifier for free. This modifier can be activated on targets by touching them with the blade, even if they aren't trying to hold or take it from the user.Card Shark:A Hidden Blade may be morphed into the appearance of any mundane 0 point item, but will still retain the properties of being a blade (IE, still sharp and capable of doing damage). Commonly used to hide blades as playing cards, household objects, pencils, sheets of paper, etc.	10	26	20	0	0	16	0	0	0
934	6	6	Hidden Fist	Onken	Building off the previous iteration of fakery, at this stage the Onken practitioner can bluff knowledge of even an expert. Provided they spend one post observing someone fighting with a specific taijutsu style, the user may imitate that style convincingly up to the same Stage as the observed target. This is, of course, a sham, and the user can't fight at all using this knowledge (no bonuses or techniques). Instead this is used to lull a target into a false sense of fairness, and to give the user more openings to exploit.		5	4	Pinata Bash:Once per thread, if struck by an attack higher in Strength Levels than their own, the user can drop some or all of their held items at once as a free action. All these items are actually still attached to the user via string, granting each item 1 use of the Return modifier that can be activated by the user at any later time in the thread.Blade Runner:As long as the user has an unseen Hidden Blade in a thread, an attack which strikes them will instead rebound off that Hidden Blade or multiple Hidden Blades that were lying just underneath their clothes where the attack hit. This destroys the Hidden Blades for the rest of the thread, but lessens Physical Levels of the attack by 1 per Hidden Blade destroyed.	Glass Knife:Owned Hidden Blades may have the Obscured modifier for free.Mentalist:By studying and getting into the head of a target, the user can seemingly learn to predict their every move. If the user has been fighting or observing at target for at least 2 posts, they may gain 2 Levels of Speed in order to dodge 1 attack from that target. This stacks for every 2 additional posts until the user decides to use it, at which point the entire bonus is consumed.Critical Hit:Through careful study of an opponent, a seemingly weak attack can somehow bypass any and all defenses. The user may pierce any Stage defensive jutsu, techniques, and armor with their Hidden weapons, but only if they are unseen while doing so. Attacks which pierce defenses this way only strike with Level 1 Strength.	15	32	28	14	0	22	0	0	0
934	7	7	Hidden Fist	Onken	At the highest level, sometimes the Onken master wants to be seen. By means of adjusting the posture, expression, and even controlling their heartbeat and breathing, the user can appear completely and utterly in control, no matter their current physical state. Every attack against them will look futile and every plan an opponent might come up with will feel insufficient. The user simply excludes an absolute aura of trickery and deception that is impossible to pierce, as if every one of their openings is actually a clever ruse that will end in death if an opponent tries to exploit it.		5	4	Omnitool:Once per thread, any item in the user's possession may be granted all the modifiers their Hidden Blades possess.Vanishing Act:Objects as large as a human body can be given the Hidden modifier as an action. This requires at minimum a reasonable method of doing so, most often in the form of using sealing tags.Confidence Game:No known method, natural or supernatural, can detect the user's falsehoods and lies. This doesn't mean targets trust them- only that there is no technique which can confirm with absolute certainty whether statements or actions taken by the user are true.	Regal Apparition:Using every trick in the book (including some actual magic, if available), weapons or items the user wields cannot be seen by mundane or even most enhanced forms of sight. Only bloodline level detection can determine the location of items held by the user. Even if they hold the items out in the open, it will appear as though they are gripping nothing. This includes any projectiles thrown for the duration. This technique lasts for the entire thread and can be turned on and off without consuming an additional usage, but requires 1 usage to activate.Safehouse:A good trickster knows when to lie low. The user has gained enough clout in the world to have connections pretty much anywhere, giving them access to their own personalized rooms tucked away in various spots, in any city or village that could be found on a map. These locations are built to keep a low profile and, while not exactly luxurious, are designed with enough amenities to last for months so the occupant(s) can lose any heat they might have accumulated. Safehouses can't be detected prior to the user entering them, and cannot be traced back to the user or otherwise linked to them outside of direct observation. When inside the safehouse, the user (and any guests) cannot be detected from outside by any methods. These safehouses can be hidden virtually anywhere that is normally publicly accessible, and the entrance is locked and disguised in such a way that only the user can open them. Only one safehouse can be used per thread, and the safehouse loses its protection once anyone or anything (including communication via radio or by other means) is observed entering or exiting the safehouse.Smoke and Mirrors:After preparing the technique, for the rest of the thread, any Hidden Blade in the user's possession may be used in a post as a free action or attack. This attack will always appear as a single movement, no matter how many weapons are involved. This can only be done once per Hidden Blade, effectively granting the user as many free actions to use in the thread as they have Hidden Blades.	22	40	37	18	0	26	0	0	0
933	1	1	Netherworld Waltz	Medio Enbu	The Dance: Extremely basic at this level, almost like the user is just learning how to move his feet but he can't quite seem to get ahold of what the hell he is trying to do. While foolish, it is not without purpose, even if it is used to get a giggle or a laugh out of an opponent at this level that can still leave him open even for a second. Mainly used as a way to distract and entertain at the expense of themselves, the user is learning to grasp the basics of their own unique style of dancing.Axe Mastery: As with every other Taijutsu when one first begins to learn, this stage of learning is also very basic. The user is incapable of performing anything extremely flashy or complicated, simple basic hack and slash tactics that intend to do one thing: Mess your opponent up. That about sums it up.		5	4			0	6	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
933	2	2	Netherworld Waltz	Medio Enbu	The Dance: Now the user is starting to gain something that all dancers need, rhythm. By gaining this they are now able to put a simple thought into opponents heads: "hey, he's not so bad". While this is very rudementry and not exactly what the user is striving for, the point is still there. They have to distract and manipulate the opponent somehow and the dance allows them to do that. Moving and flowing together slightly better than the first stage, the user is really starting to get into the flow.Axe Mastery: A nice improvement in this stage as the user is able to mix up his attacking style. At one point it can be extremely basic while on the other hand he can use his weaponry to distract you then land a strike directly where you never expected it. The user is learning to fight somewhat dirty at this level, no matter if he's using one axe or two. He is entirely focused on ripping the opponent to shreds and that is all that really ever mattered. The basics are covered here, mainly the use of disarming and shifting weight so that one weak strike can be turned into a secondary extremely offensive strike.		5	4			0	7	7	0	6	0	0	0	0
933	3	3	Netherworld Waltz	Medio Enbu	The Dance: With the final level of Genin training, the user has finally learned some sort of unique movement that he can call his own. They also tend to branch off into whatever type of dance suits them best. Some can find this to be breakdancing, for others it can be simple and rudementry movements that mask what they are really trying to do and hell...for some people it can be ballet. What matters here is that the user is getting harder, better, faster and a helluva lot stronger in his dancing rhythm. By manipulating his dance in such a way that he can leave an opponent open, he is able to take advantage of weak points much easier. Weaving and manipulating the opponent with ones dance is really starting to take focus at this stage.Axe Mastery: As ones dance tends to improve, so does the axe mastery. While their isn't much improvement from the last stage in terms of offensive fighting, the user is learning to defend themselves. Using the blade(s) of ones weaponry is vital in defending vital points from any attack the opponent can throw at you, as a users axe are his main point of offense they are also his focal point for defending. At this stage the user begins to learn the finer point of fighting, the best offense is a good defense.		5	4			0	9	11	0	8	0	0	0	0
933	4	4	Netherworld Waltz	Medio Enbu	The Dance: Now it's getting damn good. Users at this level can be mistaken for reknowned dancers usually hired at nightclubs. Whatever the user is into, and however he chooses to dance, it is always quite a show. Mezmerizing the opponent with frantic movement and things of that nature is starting to become second nature as they move to and froe across the battlefield utilizing their intense speed. While the dance itself is starting to become complex, the user is now able to use various parts of his body rather than just his feet. An example of this would be using their right hand to help them breakdance before landing a swift blow with their left...which still happens to have an axe in it. Poor ol' opponent.Axe Mastery: No longer is the user anything "basic". They are able to use their weaponry quite profiently at this point. While it is true that someone can only be so good at wielding an axe, and that there is always a limit the user is able to send shivers into opponents heart at how ferocious each swing and strike they send towards them. The earth can shiver, and the skies may tremble but no one is ever entirely sure of how a blow will land from these masters of the axe or even when it will. Utilizing their great speed they are able to land blow after consecutive blow, earning themselves quite the reputation.		5	4			7	18	18	0	14	0	0	0	0
933	5	5	Netherworld Waltz	Medio Enbu	The Dance: Hot damn bro, you really got some swift moves. Thats what users tend to hear at this level. Well, not really, but it's close [I swear it!]. They blend every movement together so perfectly and quickly that you can barely catch exactly what they are doing infront of you but you damn well know that they are doing something complicated and flashy. The user is getting close to mastering his own type of dance, and at this point it isn't hard to wow a crowd or an opponent. Each movement is so damn good, makes you wanna slap yo mamma. But not really. I don't advise that at all.Axe Mastery: Chop Chop. Dig Dig. Scratch that last part. The user has once again shifted to defence at this level, his offense has been trained well enough. Using the blade(s) of their axe(s) is the focal point once again as they try and use the bottom of the weapon itself to shift an opponents stance ever so slightly just for an opening at a vital point. It is crucial for an opponent at this level to keep his guard up, for if he even lets one single chance open up, he may walk away with a few missing bodyparts or perhaps just not walk away at all. The user is getting damn good.		5	4			9	24	23	0	16	0	0	0	0
933	6	6	Netherworld Waltz	Medio Enbu	The Dance: Near mastery. If anything the user is merely a blur as his movements blend so well together it is extremely hard for the opponent to see anything coming his way. Breakdancing, waltzing, the tango...these are all just names for whatever type of dance the user tends to specialize in. It usually all depends on what type of music the user is into, but that doesn't really matter because no matter what type of dance he tries to use...he's bound to amaze nearly anyone and anything that watches him. Hell, I wouldn't be suprised if even something as simple as a tree was dumbfounded at how well the user dances at this level.Axe Mastery: Back on the offense again. The user begins to substitute something else into the style at this level...his bare hands! That's right. The user begins to fight extremely dirty even if he was armed or not. By grasping the axe in such a way that his fingers protrude outward, the user can be known to swing and scare the opponent only to deliver a vicious eyepoke. Why you ask? Because the fool is now in pain and you sever his torso from his waist. Slight of hand m'boy. The user is nothing but a dancing machine, young and free...only seventeen. Wait. Wrong song D:		5	4			15	30	30	18	18	0	0	0	0
933	7	7	Netherworld Waltz	Medio Enbu	The Dance: Mastery. If his body allows it, and he can think of it, he can damn well put it into a dance.Axe Mastery: Mastery. If anything gets in the way of this bozo, he will cut it down. One way or another.		5	4			19	40	40	22	22	0	0	0	0
932	1	1	Heavy Skewer Slam 	Tadai Kushi Gachan	Axe Mastery: Laughable, really, yet still useful. At this point, although quite physically toned, the user cannot physically lift the axe from the ground at all, unless they deviate from the regular regiment. They fight dragging it across the ground and slamming the axe-blade into the opponents' feet. The polearm is used for defense, similar to a staff, yet as the property is usually metallic, it's quite sturdy. Even so, fighting with the axe is not reccomended at this stage, and the user is usually prone to hurt themselves, as they're only getting started using the weapon. They can fight well without the axe, using the strength they've gained from training with it to strike opponents with their fists and feet, and withstand various blows. Users of the style usually fight unarmed in this stage, and practice with the axe seperately for advancement, although it is possible to engage in combat with the axe at this stage.	5	1	3			5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
932	2	2	Heavy Skewer Slam 	Tadai Kushi Gachan	Axe Mastery: At this point, the fighter is much more useful with an axe, but by no means refined. Of course, they can lift the axe, but both hands are required and it does put some strain on them when they swing, but their stamina is high enough to endure a battle swinging the axe. They cannot lift the axe above their heads at this point, so their targeted body parts that they attack range from the torso and below. This doesn't pose to be much of a problem, as that's where they'd hit anyway. Their power, although great for one of genin level, is very inferior, and they can't cut hrough the flesh. They have enough strength to cause rather large sliced wounds to their opponents at full power with a strike, and do have the potential to cause fatal damage if they hit in the right places, but the speed in striking is slow enough for opponents to avoid most hits. Although the axe is usable, many practicioners like to wear it on their back and fight unarmed for quite a while, using the weapon as a means of defense or as a trump card in different situations.	5	1	3			8	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0
932	3	3	Heavy Skewer Slam 	Tadai Kushi Gachan	Axe Mastery: This is where the axe mastery really begins to play a part. Although they aren't srong enough to completely slice through opponents just yet, their agility in striking has improved, and they are now able to swing the axe above their head. However, they can only used the axe with such ease at the dispense of their full power. If the practicioners fight with all of their strength, their stamina is quickly drained. Strikes are usually made slowly, and attempts to slice through opponents do not occur often, a common tactic at this point is to simply slash across their body instead of dig into it. A majority of fighting is defensive, using the axe to block most physical attacks that come their way. It's not yet an offensive style to those that use it at this stage, but very useful.	5	1	3			11	0	9	0	8	0	0	0	0
932	4	4	Heavy Skewer Slam 	Tadai Kushi Gachan	Axe Mastery: This is where the true lord of battle is awakened, and the power displayed begins to be one that puts fear in the eyes of others. The strength of the users is so massiv now, that they are, indded, able to slice through the flesh of enemies in one blow. Both hand are required to grasp tightly on the polearm of the humongous weapons, but at full power, are able to rip through the bodies of enemies. They aren't too quick in movement, but rapid in comparison to users of the Decaying Fist. They don't have complete control over the axe at this point at all, and when they swing, it usually drops at a powerful force uncontrollably, but that's not too bad for the users if they're attacking from the top, attempting to split an enemy down the middle. This stage is where everything starts to get gruesome.	5	1	3			19	7	17	0	14	0	0	0	0
932	5	5	Heavy Skewer Slam 	Tadai Kushi Gachan	Axe Mastery: A terrible power has awakened in the user at this point, and not only are the movements quick and precise, but they now have complete control over the axe with both hands, able to rip clean through any opponent that stand in their way, regardless of armor. This is the point where their power is enough to slice through enemies with ease, and the users can fight for quite a while at such horrofying strength. If used to it's full abilities, most users of this style are reknowned as being quite maniacal in their ways of combat. They aren't sluggish in movements, and the agile aspect begins to play, dashing as quickly as they can into battle. Witnessing them fight at this power can be traumatizing.	5	1	3			23	12	21	0	16	0	0	0	0
932	6	6	Heavy Skewer Slam 	Tadai Kushi Gachan	Axe Mastery: Absolutely horrifying power. Not only are they now able to move at fairly quick speeds in swinging and have the ability to rip through the opponents, they now need only one hand to wield the axe. The other hand is typically used to grab the opponent so they don't get away, ensuring their own kill. At this stage, when in war, the users of the style seem to dash through their opponents, slicing away as they plow through them. Of course, all this can be seen coming and avoided, but if ones reaction time is fairly slow, they're goners. A very gruesome feat.	5	1	3			30	17	28	0	20	16	0	0	0
932	7	7	Heavy Skewer Slam 	Tadai Kushi Gachan	Axe Mastery: The Mastery is now complete, and the power is more terrible than one could possibly imagine. The usage of the axe is now extremely easy, slicing through enemies in an instant. The same tactics are used, but highly improved. The only difference about this is the sheer power used in the final stage of the style. Able to strike fear into basically everyone, the perfect warlords.	5	1	3			39	23	37	0	26	18	0	0	0
931	1	1	Nonlethal Storm	Hi-chimeiteki Arashi	There are two fundamental techniques learned at this level: the art of the block (how to intercept attacks) and the art of the cheap shot (smacking hard to defend body parts). With a chosen blunt weapon the practitioner can put up a good defense even against those with more skill than him. Disarming or landing a good blow, however, is still largely a product of chance when fighting against the odds.		4	5	The DropWith enough practice the user learns how to recover quickly from mistakes made when striking, such that a failed or missed attack no longer leaves them completely open to their opponent. Correct use of this technique takes the form of the user throwing multiple attacks with the expectation of missing almost all of them.Dumber LuckSuccess is where opportunity meets coincidence. The user's perception is now attuned to look for brief windows where their attacks do the most work. A misplaced thrust, an errant step, the telling exhale of an attacker who is about to retreat: these simple gestures now scream out at the user and become the crack which the fighter exploits to achieve victory, or at least to prolong his life.Collateral DamageRather than focusing on any one person, this technique gives the user an incredible burst of stamina, so much so that they can in that post perform a single attack against each and every single person within weapon's reach. This attack is fast, furious, and ineffectual- even if lands, it's not going to do much damage (Stage One strength equivalent). Even if the attacks are harmless the user's mighty aura will appear powerful enough to encourage those nearby to back off. The user may also hide one true attack within the storm that hits at their normal strength level.	ThunderclapAfter the users chosen weapon intercepts an attack, both weapons explode at the point of impact. The force is usually enough to send the opposing weapon hurling away at nonlethal speeds, or at the very least force the opponent's arm to rebound backwards from the force. The heavier the object caught in the explosion, the stronger it is forced outwards. Thus this technique is most effectively used with a light weapon striking a heavy one, as the light weapon will not be affected as much. One post cooldown.	0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
931	2	2	Nonlethal Storm	Hi-chimeiteki Arashi	The stress at this stage is to master the basics of movement in battle, specifically those of the opponents. How the swordsman moves his arms when he swings, how the lancer twists when he's about to thrust, how the brawler plants his feet when slugging it out: an understanding of the theory behind most weapons and how warriors use them is vital for one who specializing in separating weapon from soldier. Good improvisation requires a vast (and often shallow) pool of knowledge. Flashcards can help!Emphasis during fights is mostly placed on avoiding, deflecting, and positioning. A Nonlethal Storm practitioner's weapon is rarely used for bone shattering blows; instead the focus is on striking the weapons of your opponent or at their joints as to weaken and eventually overpower them through attrition. The idea is to keep your weapon free and nimble, as stiff and sturdy attacks tend to break the more fragile weapons of this style.		4	5	Stage ImprovSkill with your nonlethal weapon is easily transferable to anything roughly the same size, shape, and weight. A simple stick might be a substitute for a tonfa, a table leg a replacement for a bat, or a log or two by four a stand-in for a massive club. So long as the improvised weapon is similar in weight and approximately the same shape, the user can use it just as freely as they would their own weapon.Unidentified Flying ObjectThe user may hurl whatever weapon they are using at the moment with the precision of a projectile. This attack has little strength behind it, and rather is used to create or exploit openings where that little nudge makes all the difference.Police BrutalityAn unsuspecting target may be completely disarmed or incapacitated with one or a series of brutal (but silent) blows. If the target is even minimally aware of the attacker's intent, this technique does not work. It can only be done on completely unsuspecting targets who are not prepared to defend themselves, or on those who have already been rendered incapable of fighting back.	I Meant To Do ThatDerived from an older, less practiced style, this technique allows the user to imbue their chosen weapon (or improvised weapon) with elastic springiness though chakra manipulation. This gives long, wooden weapons a kind of 'bendy' nature, letting them absorb blows better. The user may even bend an entire weapon around the body part of another person, forming a kind of loop around the target with their weapon provided it is long enough. This only lasts one post and afterwords the weapon springs back to normal size and shape.Base Stage: Weapon can bend freely, but snaps back to original shape after the post is over.Stage Four: Weapon can be 'frozen' in place once bent, indefinitely.Stage Five: Bent weapons gain steel-hardened durability.	0	9	5	6	0	0	0	0	0
931	3	3	Nonlethal Storm	Hi-chimeiteki Arashi	At this stage a chosen blunt weapon with the same skill and dexterity as a regular swordsman. Primary battle strategy encourages using this weapon more as a tool to weaken and prolong engagements until the right moment presents itself, whether that be through a chance to disarm or a an opportunity to land a crushing blow.Fighting groups of people at once is possible, though still very dangerous. When fighting multiple foes the style takes on a more storm-like quality, as the focus is on lashing out in seemingly random patterns at whomever is closest in order to keep the multiple targets on their toes.		4	5	There's Always a CatchIntercepting blades is now mastered, as well as the 'twist' needed to make those holding the caught weapon lose their grip. Emphasis is placed on intercepting the opponent's weapon in such a way as to give more leverage; even if the weapon cannot be pried from their fingers, the force is often enough to unbalance the attacker.One and a Half HandsAs the nonlethal storm practitioner's weapons are lightweight, handling more than one at a time is relatively easy with some practice. Skills gained with this technique include switching back and forth between two handing a weapon, dual wielding, and swapping weapons on the fly. Ambidexterity is now a given and is necessary to maintain an edge in battle. Keeping things confusing and unpredictable with rapid weapon swapping is the hallmark of the style.Duty StepWith a twitch of the foot any item that is laying within reach can be retrieved, usually in a motion similar to 'kicking' the object off the ground. This is used for surprise attacks and for retrieving dropped weapons, though can be used on any object within reach of the user's feet.	Thunder StormRequirements: ThunderclapAfter imbuing a weapon with a vibrating, humming bit of chakra, the user strikes a solid surface. A shockwave expands outward from the point of impact for 10 feet, delivering a single Thunderclap-strength explosion along every object resting on that surface. Typically this is used on the ground to zone out enemies, but can be used on tables or walls to create a cloud of debris. Increases in radius by 2 for every additional stage past 3.	0	12	8	8	0	0	0	0	0
931	4	4	Nonlethal Storm	Hi-chimeiteki Arashi	Exploitation and follow-up are mastered at this stage. In any engagement the goal should be to create openings either through chaotic movements or through attrition. Properly timed hits at the right centers of gravity force opponents to lose either their grip or balance, opening the door for a fight-ending blow. In fact, users of this style are so good at defending at this point that they tend to gain a reputation as having a large amount of stamina. While not strictly true, blocking and deflecting attacks as become such a second nature that most can do it indefinitely against a single opponent.		4	5	All Terrain ShinobiDue to the lengthy nature of Nonlethal Storm engagements, a type of short-term muscle memory is developed to minimize the amount of attention one has to expend in the middle of a fight. The exact layout of the surroundings (furniture/walls/etc) is committed to memory, and so long as nothing is changed the user can navigate any place they've seen once already without having immediate vision of the area. This isn't clairvoyance but does allow the user to freely move about the engagement without fear of tripping over themselves.VibratoSpecific areas on the limbs can cause a 'fuzzy' sensation when struck, not quite numbing the body part but making using it difficult. The user knows where these locations are and can strike them with their weapon, causing severe discomfort for several seconds in the targeted limb. This technique is not painful but extremely uncomfortable.	Death of a Thousand CutsSubmission through pain is another 'nonlethal' technique, and using a bit of chakra targeted at the nerves the user can gain a significant advantage in long fights. Every time a hit is scored on a limb (can go through 1 layer of clothing/armor), the amount of pain the target feels in that limb is doubled. This effect can be removed by a medical shinobi or by the target not receiving any additional blows for two posts.	10	19	14	14	0	0	0	0	0
931	5	5	Nonlethal Storm	Hi-chimeiteki Arashi	Siege fighting is more or less mastered, as enough fighting stamina has been accumulated to effectively fight a 1 on 1 engagement for an entire day if needed. What was once a cursory knowledge in fighting styles has become at this point an encyclopedic understanding of the martial arts, provided the art itself is well-known in the world. The largest weakness in the style is still ending fights decisively, as those equal in skill and training to the user are difficult to pin down long enough to finish the fight.		4	5	Stick StuckBlows from sharp weapons that would otherwise break the users weapon (improvised or otherwise) will not, once per weapon. Instead of breaking the object will merely become lodged in the opponent's sword or blade. The user's object will be stuck to the attacker's weapon until they remove it, weighing them down and preventing them from following up effectively.Stick To ItThis technique simply shatters the users weapon after an attack is delivered. The explosive attack forces shards of the fractured weapon into the flesh of the opponent as well as delivering a mighty blow. Naturally, this also destroys the weapon used.	Thunder GodRequirements: ThunderclapThe user themselves begins to glow with golden light as they charge themselves with grossly incandescent chakra. For one post, every attack which lands on them delivers a single Thunderclap-strength blast in that direction. This doesn't stop the damage from the attack, but having an monstrous explosion that can knock their weapon from their hand occur on each contact tends to discourage further aggression. One post cooldown.	15	23	18	16	0	0	0	0	0
931	6	6	Nonlethal Storm	Hi-chimeiteki Arashi	In a fair fight, it is virtually impossible to kill the practitioner with a weapon heavier than their own. Improvisation has been honed to such a degree that even swordsmen of equal or greater skill can be fought toe-to-toe with whatever random objects happen to be at hand. Because originality and imagination can't be trained or strengthened with practice, only experience will teach the user how to stay alive within the chaos they create.		4	5	Harder Better FasterThe Nonlethal Storm expert has been in the business long enough to know the right people. All wooden or otherwise fragile weapons are now made of quality, expensive materials that can withstand much more powerful blows. Bottom line: purchased weapons don't break unless the user wants them too.Three and a Half HandsThe dexterity of the user has reached a point where using upwards of three weapons simultaneously is possible. Projectiles can be flung from between the fingers holding weapons, hand seals can be completed without missing a block or dodge, and weapons gripped in unorthodox places such as between the feet or tucked in the mouth are just as viable and dangerous as the ones in both hands. Causing a storm of chaos from all directions is, as always, the goal.	Premature DefenestrationDescription: The final submission technique, this ability gives the ultimate skill in forcing an opponent to surrender: with a single well placed strike and burst of chakra, the user induces a level of euphoria into the target so great that any and all killing intent is instantly eradicated. Technically the effect is caused by oxygen deprivation to the brain, but to those affected it will seem as though suddenly everything is fantastic and there is nothing to worry or fear. Notably this technique can be resisted by those who find great pleasure in battle but even then the high will induce them to prolong the battle as much as possible in order to hold onto the good feelings, offering the user a chance to escape or counter attack.	20	30	25	20	16	0	0	0	0
931	7	7	Nonlethal Storm	Hi-chimeiteki Arashi	More than perfect deflecting and blocking is now easily achievable, to the point where even the strongest or fastest attacks can be intercepted and completely diverted into other people. Sublime improvisation manifests here and there is no limit to what couldn't be turned into a weapon so long as the shinobi can lift it. Fights with those below them are ended nearly immediately, whereas those above can be extended as long as needed until an opening can be found. To defeat the Nonlethal Storm at this stage requires sheer force of power; outmaneuvering or outfighting them is a risky and likely futile effort.		4	5	Meet a FistAt the final level there exists no item the Nonlethal Storm cannot turn into a weapon- including their own limbs. Every skill and ability in the tree may also be applied to their own body, whether it be their arms, legs, head, or what have you. Just like with all the other techniques in the style, the user's weapons are fragile- just as fragile as their own flesh, in this case. Any technique which would break a weapon will likewise break the body part they are using, though otherwise there are no limits to what skills might be adapted for hand-to-hand use.	ThunderdomeRequirement: ThunderclapEvery strike dulls the blade and soul of those it hits. This technique uses the blinding speed of the Nonlethal Storm combined with the mighty power of the thunderclap to shatter every weapon within reach of the user, simply by striking it with their own. Weapons which do not break are dulled to the point of uselessness. The only way to avoid this technique is to not touch the weapon of the user, a difficult task given their superior speed and skill at catching blades and arms of all types.	27	39	33	24	20	0	0	0	0
930	1	1	Earthquake	Jishin	-What the hell? At this stage, the user is more likely to deal damage to themselves than to an opponent; haphazardly swinging around their weapon like a madman, hoping to smash up something or another, even if it does happen to be their own team-mate. They barely have the strength to lift their weapon over their head, although they are slightly stronger than the average shinobi at their level.	5		4		-Shindou [Tremor]: A quick, useful technique to knock an opponent offguard; by charging chakra into their weapon, and striking the earth immediately in front of them, the user can create a small tremor which causes the opponent to stumble or lose their balance for a moment While this causes no damage whatsoever, this split-second advantage can be all the time the user needs to end the battle.	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
930	2	2	Earthquake	Jishin	- Whoa there, are we taking it up a notch? The shinobi at this level gains some insight in conserving energy needed to wield their hefty weapon. Random swings and smashes give way to a patient stance in battle, where the user invites the opponent to close the distance between them before lashing out with all the strength they can muster. However, wielding their instrument of chaos is still mildly awkward, and one or two adepts have been known to club themselves unconcious when they became overzealous.	5		4			8	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0
930	3	3	Earthquake	Jishin	- Decent, say most. The user can now safely call themselves a specialist in blunt weaponry, now being familiar with all the quirks and flaws of their weapon of choice. Stamina develops at this point, leading to quick dashes during battle to surprise and crush an opponent. Overhead swings, sideways smashes, and uppercuts are all feasable at this stage, but most require a two-handed grip to deal some good damage.	5		4		- Gouzen Tsuchi [Roaring Earth]: Because this style concentrates on close-range combat, engaging long-range opponents can become quite a hassle. This technique becomes a method to circumvent outmanuevering an opponent. By rapidly spinning their weapon overhead, and then charging the blunt instrument with chakra, the user can throw the weapon. It travels in a boomerang-like manner towards the opponent, and can strike a blow with 2/3 of the user's strength (with bonuses+stances). The weapon moves at a a speed equal to the user's strength, and has a range of 25 feet.	10	0	10	0	8	0	0	0	0
930	4	4	Earthquake	Jishin	- "Oh, shi-" most opponents exclaim, before having their heads bashed by the user. Here, we separate the men and women from boys and girls. The user develops their strength further more, gaining the ability to crack stone and wood, and more importantly skulls, with their weapon. In this stage, a unique flair in the user's battle style develops, one that perfectly mirrors their personality. An impatient brute might dash into battle quickly, dishing out damage and taking in some too, while a patient tactician would settle down and invite the opponent to come to them.	5		4			20	10	13	0	14	0	0	0	0
930	5	5	Earthquake	Jishin	- Whoa there. The user has become a regular terror at this stage, dishing out incredible amounts of damage with their weapon. Armored opponents are easily dispatched, their metallic protection easily crumpled and thrashed by crushing blows. The adept also learns how to deal with exceptionally agile enemies, utilizing the Doshakuzure stance more effectively. Stamina and speed develop as well, although advancement in these physical divisions cannot compare to the brute strength of the user at this level.	5		4		-Tsuchi Haoto [Earth Buzz]: A defensve/offensive technique which gives the user a little space to think. By smashing their weapon into the ground, the adept creates a shockwave of sorts. This shockwave is relatively small, with a radius of 7 feet, but it carries with it the user's full strength. Along with the wave, the ground that the shockwave passes over ripples violently, so that anyone standing in the radius of the wave will most certainly lose their balance. The shockwave also nullifies all defensive ninjutsu of the same stage (read: cancels, not breaks through) and offensive jutsu one stage below the user's stage of proficiency in Jishin.

Crushing blows decimate even the most sturdy of opponents, and lesser shinobi quiver at the raw power the adept wields in their hands. At this point, even normal blows (ie without any chakra) from a user's weapon may cause the earth to tremble and shake; such is the power of Jishin.	5		4			30	22	23	0	18	18	0	0	0

The speed and strength with which the user brings down the weapon causes a vacuum to form, compressing the air in a linear path [Power x 2] meters north, south, west and east of the user. Along this entire path, the force of the blow is applied, causing incredible devastation.	40	29	30	0	26	18	0	0	0
929	1	1	Balance of Heaven Bo 	Kinkou no Kouten Bo Kata	The initiate has begun work on refining their art into something suitable for war. Anyone can pick up a staff and use it to thrust-what sets the user apart from them is the sheer fluidity of their motions. This is not an art learned by old men in stuffy dojos in contemplative hours, but through skirmish and battle of all sorts.Even those who know the true destructive potential of the quarterstaff are rarely prepared for other forms of attack. The user has become well versed at switching rapidly from one form to another-letting one arm hold their bo as they toss kunai or shuriken with their other hand, smashing a foot into the enemy's shin while their eyes are still on the man-high staff in their opponent's hand.Kinkou no Kouten is a brutal and beautiful style, but now all that's seen in the user's hands is brutality, though even that is impressive in its own ways.	4	3	2	Vital StrikeTime and practice has given the initiate an understanding of not only aiming their quarterstaff properly, but predicting their opponent's motions. Should an enemy not properly guard themselves, a user of Kinkou no Kouten can move in for a quick takedown-or even outright kill. The user releases the hand they are using to grip a quarter of the way down the staff and thrusts forward with the one left at the base, earning precious extra inches. Both kneecaps are popular targets for incapacitation, and the fragile throat of an enemy will shatter with ease, ensuring death.		4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
929	2	2	Balance of Heaven Bo 	Kinkou no Kouten Bo Kata	Though it finds its origins in the mass of the common people, at its heart Kinkou no Kouten is a destructive art. This shows in their movements, their power; strong and fast perhaps in spite of the user's own physical build. Wooden staves are shunned-why fight with something that can't parry a sword, or turn aside a powerful blow without shattering? They are limited only by the strength of their weapon, and users of this level know this.The ingenuity of the staff begins to show itself here. An aggressive style, the Kinkou no Kouten takes full advantage of the incredible range of the bo, moving forward in great lunges, using thrusts to force the enemy to move backward or take a wound.It is vital that a user thinks smart, using this newfound power over the opponent to manipulate his position in the battlefield to something more suitable for their purposes, whether it's against the wall so they can strike a final blow or catch them a situation where they are left deathly vulnerable to the user's other techniques, Kinkou no Kouten or otherwise.	4	3	2			7	0	7	0	0	6	0	0	0
929	3	3	Balance of Heaven Bo 	Kinkou no Kouten Bo Kata	The quarterstaff is much like the spear in terms of its versatility in targeting. There is none of the delay or obvious cues hand-to-hand and kenjutsu styles fall prey to when aiming very low or very high, allowing a user to attack pretty much anywhere with little warning.By now the user knows what is practical and what is not. A staff sweep is not, but slipping your bo behind their foot and tugging it out from under them is only pragmatic. In addition, training has given the initiate skill enough to manipulate their quarterstaff to make new sorts of attacks and feints.	4	3	2	DenialThe user moves forward in what seems to be a typical thrust, giving the opponent time to bring up his guard. They then twist the spear off course, letting it go a foot or so to the right of where they originally aimed, then slam the staff to the side. While less potent than a thrust overall, it gives the user new options and allows them to bypass most mundane guards against thrusts without resorting to insane swings of their weapon.		10	0	10	0	0	8	0	0	0
929	4	4	Balance of Heaven Bo 	Kinkou no Kouten Bo Kata	The amateur bo wielder familiarizes themselves with wide, graceful-seeming motions, as wide as they are powerful. Experienced users of Kinkou no Kouten use their quarterstaff in quick motions, leaving the enemy hurting and retreating even as the initiate moves in to finish them off with a thrust.Now moving beyond simple thrusts, the user learns to step forward into closer range, losing much of the safety of distance in exchange for the versatile uses of the staff at close range. The quick, sideways slapping motion used to attack may seem weak from afar, but it carries the power of the user's entire body and the natural leverage of the bo. It hurts, and while it does not have the power of a thrust behind it enough hits in the same place will still fracture bones.They are quick and strong, almost unnatural in its grace, and rightly so. While tactics and practicality give this style its flavor, the balance of physical and mental disipiline is what gives the user such proficiency with their weapon.	4	3	2			15	14	14	0	0	14	0	0	0

A dodged thrust might be carried into a flying knee, a swipe to the side aborted at the last second to kicking a descending attacker away before they could get off a lethal hit.Balance. The incredible aggression that the style finds its basis in is rooted in a complex balance between power and agility; Strength to break your enemies, speed to catch them. Without these Kinkou no Kouten would be left a castrated wreck of a style.The user learns that though their quarterstaff can take hits, it's best not to. Evasion is the watchword of this area of growth, but again it remembers its origins and plays it off in its own way. The user does not dodge to the side, but duck below an attack, left in a perfect position for a thrust at the heart. They deflect a sword blow to the side with their staff and slam it into the other man's hand, forcing them to drop their own weapon.	4	3	2			19	18	19	0	0	16	0	0	0

Stronger, faster, the Kinkou no Kouten practitioner finds themselves, impossibly, with still more control over their technique.By forcing the staff forward in their grip as they thrust or swing, they can make it seem as though their weapon has extended by several inches, throwing enemies off their guard and making them misjudge the true range of your weapon. It's a special trick though, and once the enemy knows of it the chances of success are much reduced, so save it for a vital moment.	4	3	2			25	25	25	17	0	19	0	0	0

There is no higher level they can step to, no new plateaus to climb and conquer, but in another way this is only the beginning of their learning, for it at this stage where they begin to improvise, to depart from tried and tested formulas. Where they take their quarterstaff to the battlefield and integrate new habits and techniques that they find useful.That they will get no stronger is not an excuse.

928	1	1	Arsenal of the Brave	Kitsui no Zouheishou	In the beginning, every student of Kitsui no Zouheishou is treated as an equal, regardless of prior Taijutsu training. Even if one does not plan to develop their skills to the level of mastery, the road to better understanding must begin with an unfettered state of mind with which to perceive safe footing on the path ahead. Each hopeful receives the same simple staff (5' in length rather than the conventional 6') and a fixed syllabus of exercises. However, disciples are advised not to engage an opponent with their training Bo until they have reached the Second Stage. If the new student cannot yet achieve control over even the most fundamental movements then they are no more than a ninja swinging a stick. The teachings of the First Stage seek to reinforce existing acrobatic tendencies and introduce the core skills necessary for any Bo staff user. They also provide enlightenment into the school's historical and theoretical aspects. This is the only 'general stage' but in some ways also the most important. Some of the preparatory exercises are listed below:Ebb and Flow Familiarisation: In order to one day gauge how any staff will move in their hands before they wield it, the student must first grow accustomed to the weight of their own weapon. This can be done by shifting the bo into various grips without breaking contact, rolling it up and down their palms and along their arms, and tossing and catching it with or without looking.Pick-up Stick: Connection is the key to separation; to correctly handle a Bo staff under the umbrella of Kitsui no Zouheishou one must be able to retrieve their weapon quickly and efficiently. At this stage, the simplest and most commonly used method is for the student to flick the near end of the training staff into the air from the ground using only their fingers and catching the length of wood as close to the bottom as possible. This exercise can also be accomplished using one's feet, in which case the student approaches the Bo at a point along its length and rolls the pole onto the tops of the toes with the bottom of the foot.Novice Spins: Here, the fledgling staff juggler learns how to correctly spin their Bo using one or both hands. Although initial efforts may be clumsy, twirling the weapon above the head, out in front and on either side of the body will begin to build up hand-eye co-ordination, muscle memory, spatial awareness and confidence.Superior tumbling is one of the most important features of Kitsui no Zouheishou, especially given its application to unarmed scenarios (in the contexts of evasion and later attack chains), and so the First Stage syllabus covers acrobatics and staff-handling separately. Training in acrobatic staff-handling is only given from the Second Stage onwards upon the consolidation of the following techniques:Travelling Rolls: From a crouch or an upright position, the student can roll forward, backward and to either side over a surface with good form, balance and speed.Handstands: The student can perform a stable handstand with one hand or both from either a stationary position or during movement.Cartwheels: With the optional addition of a round-off, the student will be able to execute successive cartwheels on both their good and bad sides.Elevated Jumps: The student will understand the proper technique and training required to arrive at those once hard-to-reach locations in fewer bounds and to descend from high places with greater precision.Controlled Landings: When travelling at speed and landing against a surface, the student will be able to absorb the impact and preserve some of their momentum.	4	4	1	Although it is recommended that beginners refrain from applying their staff exercises to actual conflict at this point, the school's original masters realised that self defense would become an issue for those relying on Kitsui no Zouheishou as their sole outlet for Taijutsu. The techniques they created allow the student to defend themselves without resorting to attacks that actively utilise the staff, which include:Free Form Fighting: Basic punches, kicks and blocks found in the majority of other styles (unarmed).Fixed-hand Kicking: With the staff in a two-handed, knuckles-up grip, the student raises their weapon from its neutral guard in front of their chest, allowing them to execute a single inside kick, outside kick, straight kick, hook kick or roundhouse kick with either leg before lowering the staff again.Kick Flick: The first technique to hint at the act of misdirection which becomes prominent in later stages, the student stands side-on to their target and holds the Bo in a two-handed grip with one end pointing out in front of them and weight resting on their rear foot. With the tip of the staff dipped slightly, they test the distance to reach their foe then flick up the end as if to strike but instead hop forward to deliver a straight kick with the leading leg.		0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
928	2	2	Arsenal of the Brave	Kitsui no Zouheishou	The Fan Style is the most artistic of Kitsui no Zouheishou's strategies, employing rapid twirling of the Bo staff across various parts of the body. This is a dramatic step up from the Novice Spin of the First Stage, with the velocity of revolutions and creativity in their application emphasised. It also provides disciples with a clear comparison to Shuiro and Ago's original practice.The student will not only be able to spin the pole with one or both hands but across their shoulders and neck, around their wrists and even around their ankles. The circular motions which apply rotating pressure to maintain contact between staff and limb become a real test of strength and endurance, which helps to develop a leaner physique. This is also the first Stage in which the students may enjoy the fruits of their labour and combine staff-handling with every acrobatic skill learnt so far. The improved awareness and control of their weapon means that the user can afford to divert their attention elsewhere, namely into mediating the balance between body and Bo. For instance, one might roll to the side over their shoulders in order to evade an attack but keep their twirling 'fan' angled upwards to provide a measure of protection. Provided that the Kitsui no Zouheishou beginner understands the theoretical and historical elements of the school and has earned the approval of their master through a demonstration of skill, they are now allowed to engage opponents directly with the Bo but are still advised to employ a balance of hand-to-hand and weapon techniques. Two-handed strikes alone or on the tail end of staff twirls are common fare for the Stage Two practitioner, while kicks have grown less abrupt and are more frequent.Diving Rolls: The student can cover greater distances and avoid small obstructions with this variation on the typical roll.Flip Ups: Traditionally performed from one's back or shoulders, the student throws their legs in an arc underneath them and uses the compression and extension in their spine to land on their feet.Headstands: Using the crown of their head and their hands as a tripod of support, the student can enter, hold and roll out of a headstand in a smooth and balanced manner.Forward Head Flips: Combining the principles of a flip up and a headstand, this move can be initiated from the feet or from the head. From standing, the student inverts themselves to perform a headstand then throws their legs underneath them to spring back to their feet.Butterfly: This aerial move is the first to imitate the twirling Bo's visual impact with the body and is a favourite among students of the Second Stage. This is achieved by dipping the head and torso in a U-shape to the side and using the new lateral momentum to kick off from the ground; tucking in one's limbs facilitates a powerful twist along their axis, whereas spreading them like butterfly wings as the back is arched creates a graceful, floating transition to land. This is a very useful technique for evasion and even dynamic entries.	4	4	1	Juggler's Trip: With their Bo revolving around an ankle, the student lowers the foot to trip nearby foes, hopping over the pole with their free, supporting leg - more useful as a transitory move than an extended assault.Maiden's Shield: The template for Maiden's Shield is similar to the popular Bo technique of spinning the pole very quickly hand over hand to create a revolving barrier that can block weaker physical strikes and deflect a number of slower-moving projectiles. The key difference with Fan Style Kitsui no Zouheishou is that a shield may be erected on any single axis, the most practical being a raised ankle twirl, thus freeing up the hands for ninjutsu seals.Rolling Neck Whip: To ensure that the opponent is given less time and space to strike, this technique uses the majority of the Bo's length and can be applied as a rolling combination from side to side. With an opponent to one's left, the practitioner would hold the near end of the staff in their right hand and extend their arm to sweep across their body with their head tilted to the right. The aim is actually to fall short of the intended target and spin the staff a half revolution around the back of the neck which then tilts the head to the left and clears a path for the Bo. Switching hands and grabbing the staff with their left, the user can now throw this arm much further and surprise the opponent.		0	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0
928	3	3	Arsenal of the Brave	Kitsui no Zouheishou	The introduction of Pillar Style is the first point at which the student will come to truly understand that there is madness to the method and that, unlike traditional staff styles, at the heart of Kitsui no Zouheishou lies a game. Stepping away from the fundamental principles of staff handling, the progression of the art from Fan to Pillar style becomes entirely unorthodox and therefore quite challenging in its break from expectations. Yet in the minds of its playful progenitors (and those who are ready to advance) the logic remains sound. Reliance between student and staff becomes a key tenet as their roles are reversed. At first, the Bo served as a living extension of the shinobi core. Now it has become the disciple's turn to dance around their partner and rely on the other's strength, flexibility and durability. More tool than weapon, adepts of this Stage will begin to platform and actually use the Bo with its natural affordances of weight-bearing and obstruction in mind.For instance, by stabbing the tip of their Bo into a relatively soft surface like the ground in front of them or the bark of a nearby tree, the practitioner can effectively create a simple barricade and distance themselves from their opponent. Weaving in and out of the new space with the trustworthy pillar in place, the student may proceed to confuse their foe with ever-changing evasive patterns. Yet awareness of the immediate environment and their static partner's limitations is essential in judging how deep they must drive their weapon and how much weight they can then afford to place upon the staff. However, evasion means little if one cannot return to the fray with a new trick up their sleeve. The wielder will find that their Bo cannot remain stationary for too long lest their foe attack it directly and so it remains ever on the move, as must its guardian. This kind of combat forces the student to work on their own flexibility and agility in order to successfully orbit the axis of their weapon wherever it may be placed. Equally, the act of stabbing a 5' length of wood into a firm surface is by no means an easy task, especially when only one hand might be available to apply the driving force. Luckily, training poles can be easily replaced while learning how to control pressure and precision. Strength and muscle toning take a significant leap over the course of the Stage and this in turn affects the pillar combinations available to the practitioner.The acrobatic feats introduced at this stage also take something of a leap in that they push the student's broad skills along a path tailored more towards the Kitsui no Zouheishou mentality. With personal creativity and versatility under any situation an ongoing pursuit, the immediate constrictions of this redirection will ultimately open the student's mind to an entirely new perception of acrobatic invention. With the staff in hand, one's movements begin to reflect the symbiosis:Hand/Elbow Stand: Depending on the stance of the practitioner, they will be able to perform a sustained handstand or elbow stand with one arm whilst utilising their Bo with the other.Wheel Vault: A single-handed cartwheel initiated by a forceful dive to one side.Drunken Crab: The Kitsui no Zouheishou adept makes good use of their agility and gift for misdirection by evading attacks with a sudden drop to the ground, arching back into a crab position. However, instead of supporting themselves with both hands, they can employ the Bo like a pincer to be thrust into the ground behind their head and act as an anchor.Slingshot: Following on from the principle of using the grounded staff as a tether, the wielder relies on its flexible nature as they hold onto the weapon at any point along its length and swing around its axis, feet first.	4	4	1	I - Fool's Flick: Upon luring an opponent closer to the vertically placed Bo, its wielder will pull on the staff to make it snap back for that satisfying, albeit juvenile, THWACK!II - Axeman's Bane: Upon luring an opponent closer to the vertically placed Bo, the adept drives the outer blade of their leading foot into the ground at its base in order to dislodge their staff and immediately grabs the free-falling upper end. With the Bo's reach now extended and weight fully on the forward foot, the adept can easily hop forward on the tail end of the technique to deliver a fierce stab at the opponent's shins followed by a two-handed skyward flick.I - Pole Vault: Stabbing one end of the Bo into the ground, its wielder uses the supple bend of the wood to carry their weight over an obstruction or even up to reach greater heights (note: retrieving their partner from the ground mid-vault will naturally diminish momentum)II - Monkey's Tower: Not so much a stab as a mere placement, the adept has grown accustomed to balancing on the Bo itself and is able to perch easily at any point along its length, either at rest or while in motion. This technique is frequently used to maintain elevation in one's evasive efforts and resembles the deft movements of a monkey on the branch of a tree.I - Horse Tail Whip: With the Bo at rest behind one's head and laid equally on the shoulders, hands at either end, the illusion of an opening is complete. Should the opponent advance too quickly, the staff wielder may choose to engage them with a leaping outside kick (i.e. right foot travelling from left to right across the body) followed closely by the trailing foot, combined with a horizontal Bo swipe under the raised legs moving in the opposite direction. Landing side-on to their foe with the length of their staff held behind them, the disciple's deceptive tricks may continue from there.II - Reverse Hornet Sting: With the Bo fixed securely to a vertical surface and extending at a perpendicular angle so as to fend off encroaching foes, the adept draws the opponent in to make the first strike but jukes away underneath the free end of the pole and emerges on the other side to leap over it feet first in a flying kick. Holding onto the Bo, one can rely on its strength and durability to enable the seamless change in direction and additional propulsion necessary to complete the technique smoothly.		0	10	10	0	0	8	0	0	0
928	4	4	Arsenal of the Brave	Kitsui no Zouheishou	This is the third and final aspect of Kitsui no Zouheishou, the second stage of separation from one's staff and the commencement of the student's journey towards perfecting a total weapon style. Boomerang Style introduces the concept of staff juggling and involves an extreme sense of timing and foresight in order to craft an unpredictable offense of angles and rebounds.One must learn to volley their staff as if it were a boomerang. Simply put, once the launched Bo strikes the enemy, the initial force applied will send it on a rebound back into its partner's hands or, more commonly, the crook of their foot. As with the Pick-up Stick method, should the Bo fall to the ground for whatever reason, the adept will have discovered by this point that bending down is the least practical means of retrieving the weapon and that it is far more effective to use one's feet. It is even more effective if said retreival becomes an unexpected counterattack by rolling the Bo onto the toes and kicking it into the opponent. Before one can even hope to progress to the Fifth Stage, the completion of two successive volleys in a live sparring situation must be mastered.Students of this stage have now begun to read their opponents' bodies for hints of potential weaknesses. Vulnerable soft spots become unguarded in the face of one who attacks from numerous angles through multiple means of combat. The bodies of Kitsui no Zouheishou practitioners have grown into considerable fighting specimens, lithe and firm with a springy strength akin to that of their Bo. They too are now a weapon and no longer need to rely solely on the staff in hand to successfully land a hit. As confidence in one's movements and ability to control those of their partner-in-crime improves, students will naturally seek to push their acrobatic tendencies further and experiment with more risky and rewarding manoeuvres. All previous Fan techniques have become instinctive for most of these situations while Pillar transitions have grown less abrupt. The student has developed a natural understanding of which surfaces might yield preferred results and how to optimally disperse weight across the staff while retaining good mobility.Attack and defence, body and Bo, stationary and dynamic; there is now a balance to Kitsui no Zouheishou. Emphasis no longer lies in dancing around the opponent but in moving with the ebb and flow of the game, advancing as well as retreating and maintaining a penchant for the unexpected. The student will begin to search for their own unique flair within the style and the master will allow their pupil a degree of freedom from the regimented teachings in order to achieve this goal. No-handed cartwheels, backflips and somersaults become common fare and near-instant recoveries from the ground help facilitate the ideal of a body in perpetual motion.	4	4	1	The Forgetful Beggar: Either by dropping the staff or performing a pick-up, the student traps their Bo in the space between the two opposing pressures of one foot's crook and the other's heel. Flicking their feet in opposite directions and tucking in their legs will result in a horizontal rotation to trip the opponent or catch them with a feint and reverse the Bo's direction mid-spin. This is an excellent move for dispatching a mob of adversaries or simply hammering a single foe with a continuous juggle.Beggar's Lucky Coin: If thrown to ground but still within a leg's reach of the staff, the adept performs a pick-up from lying down and transitions directly into a recovery. This particular recovery follows the staple movements of a reverse coin drop, swinging one straight leg diagonally across their body and over their shoulders, following through with the second leg and pushing with the hands to find their feet (or delaying the moment of recovery with an added handstand twist for style). However, with the Bo balancing on the leading foot, the 'Beggar' can protect himself and so once his weight has shifted to the shoulders and hands, the secondary leg can snap round to spin the staff as in the previous technique until he lands firmly on both feet.Heavenly Climb: The achievement of this technique represents a critical step in the progression of the Kitsui no Zouheishou disciple, combining heightened spatial awareness with precise acrobatic pacing and the control required to perform a double volley with the feet even when the Bo is out of sight. Flicking the staff into the opponent's midsection, the adept leaps into the air with the other leg which then swings forward to make the rebound volley with an even greater force so that they might flip backwards and catch the staff with both hands on its return trip.Armed with the knowledge of the incredible possibilities which have begun to dance at their fingertips, the student of Kitsui no Zouheishou will take this time between stages to master each of the lessons provided by their sensei thus far. Above all else, it is essential that the movements become not only second but first nature to them, intrinsically linked to their body's internal rhythm. Many have reached this point but been unable to take the art form further due to a mental block. It is one thing to know what it is they must be able to do and remember the motions, but another entirely to realise that they have already internalised the teachings and that the Arsenal has ceased to exist as a Taijutsu style, instead becoming a way of life. From this platform they can begin anew, discarding their training staff and receiving permission to bear a full 6' Bo. Most will choose to craft their own weapon due to the personal connection the two beings will come to share, and time is taken to familiarise oneself with their partner's new capabilities. It is not uncommon to see the introduction of metal poles for the improved durability they afford; the wielder will know what works best with their individual style.		12	14	17	0	0	14	0	0	0
928	5	5	Arsenal of the Brave	Kitsui no Zouheishou	Since the introduction of Fan Style, the capacity for dazzling displays of art and speed will have always seemed just out of reach, as if slumbering at the back of the mind. As the glue that holds all combinations together, the practitioner's Fan techniques will have steadily developed throughout the Third and Fourth Stages, but only by breaking through the glass ceiling to the Fifth Stage will the potential phoenix within be awakened.The pace of the adept has quickened in both dexterity of the limb and lightness of the body while their mind, now attuned to the way of the game, sees clear patterns where there was once blank space. The speed of revolutions doubles to the extent that a pole in motion comes to resemble a swirling wreath of colour. To those who are unused to such speeds, the wielder may become partially obscured behind the blurred disc, which naturally gains a boost in defensive potential against smaller projectiles and indirect physical attacks. Improved awareness of the staff's capacity to gradually transfer rather than simply deflect the momentum of projectiles allows the adept to 'catch' and re-launch small weapons individually using the Bo itself. The is an evolved form of the technique employed to spin the staff around a wrist or ankle.The practitioner can now link twirls across the shoulders and torso with confidence and improved precision, although self-control and spatial awareness are not yet perfect. Mistakes are still possible but not as common as in previous stages. A notable addition to the Arsenal is a Boomerang-influenced ability to twirl the staff through the air. Among other more complex motivations, this is particularly useful for instantly freeing up the hands for an unarmed attack or ninjutsu that may be the only thing quick enough to penetrate the enemy's defense. As expressed in the early stages of the style, utter reliance on the Bo is dangerous. For this reason, teachers will continue to polish their students' unarmed fighting techniques until the Sixth Stage, at which point it falls to the staff wielder to shore up gaps in their versatility. The majority of students will begin to open up in their attitudes towards hand-to-hand combat and experiment with the duality of the style. The physical benefits gained thus far are by no means trivial, and although punches and kicks will typically connect with less power they can appear from just as many unpredictable angles.The adept continues to explore new territory as they come to define their acrobatic stance. Some might tailor their movements to a grounded approach, including mimesis of the animal kingdom, hand balance, tripping sweeps and floor-work, and horizontal aerials. Alternatively, one might amaze and confound their opponent with a lively and intricate display of flips, somersaults and dives, using every surface in their environment to the fullest. Of course, those who spit in the face of limitations and incorporate both high and low aspects into their acrobatic arsenal will grow to be the most proficient practitioners of Kitsui no Zouheishou. Few will specialize, but it has happened. The student has now been instructed in all conventional acrobatic techniques, and applying them as a means of attack, evasion or both is common fare. The new challenge is planning one's combinations for possible outcomes in order to remain at least one if not two steps ahead of opponents. At this stage, the student is expected to be sparring against those who will be of a similar level in other Taijutsu styles and experiencing crucial developments of their own.Techniques: By the Fifth Stage, there are no more regular techniques to be learnt; all are now decidedly atypical and rely on the inventiveness of the student, for instance:Closing distance with an intricate shuffle of footwork that suggests a grounded attack, the student then launches into a long dive to cross the remaining space, twirling the Bo in front of them like a propeller to act as a shield against projectiles. Upon contact with the ground, a tight roll is performed to minimize vulnerability and increase recovery speed as the student rises, the Bo now held around their ankles. Spinning the Bo to catch the opponent off guard and force them to stumble with a strike to the lower legs, the student follows up with a haymaker punch, simultaneously kicking the staff up behind and overhead. As the weapon rises, the student continues, placing their haymaker hand on the ground to finish with a one-handed, double-footed cartwheel kick at close range. By timing their movements correctly the staff should fall neatly into their hands and they can then press the advantage. (Reference: Meia Lua Reversao Capoeira)	4	4	1			16	18	22	0	0	16	0	0	0
928	6	6	Arsenal of the Brave	Kitsui no Zouheishou	The Sixth Stage arrives with the realisation that the staff is no longer the only pillar in this partnership. Only those with the constitution or guile to survive unarmed for longer periods are deemed worthy to benefit from the teachings of the Mother Tree. It will take more than speed and style alone to overcome the kind of opponent that a student of this level is likely to face. The training regiment intensifies drastically to mentally and physically hone the two beings into a single, dynamic weapon, like boughs entwined to create a platform sturdier than the sum of its parts.Balancing on the Bo (or any other surface, regardless of chakra techniques) is a thing of beauty, and with their acute muscular control, one can even begin to combat the enemy from this perch as easily as they would from the ground. Augmented levels of strength allow the adept to physically drive the staff into any surface that it has been prepared for. Wood will still shatter against stone but a metal-tipped Bo would remain intact and find enough purchase for one's purposes. When not applied to the natural world, the spearing technique is just as useful in jabs or powerful thrusts made against the opponent. It may seem peculiar for emphasis to placed on this traditional attack so late in one's training, but such was the logic of the Grand Master: the student would be forced to think outside the box from the very beginning and place their assuming opponents at a severe disadvantage. The final benefit to those who have reached the Branch of the Mother Tree is that their environmental awareness will have reached its peak. The practitioner has now become an expert at reading the risks and rewards of each and every surface or obstacle in their vicinity.Like those of the Mother Tree, the student's roots must run deep and strong. Acrobats of the Sixth Stage are a sight to behold, each motion executed with near-flawless balance and ingenuity. Mistakes become rare yet thrilling occasions to test the boundaries of creativity under pressure and are likely to provide an even greater show than tried and tested formulas. The adept will no doubt lust for a means by which to break through the final limitations of the body and become a paragon of poise and unpredictability although it is difficult to imagine a more outlandish display of acrobatics. Unfortunately, that is where the majority of students fall short of complete mastery. The sensi is responsible for judging whether the student has the potential to shatter those barriers and progress to the Seventh Stage, which requires one to be able to fully (and bravely) surrender their body to the flow of battle and unlock all doors to the arsenal.	4	4	1			20	23	32	0	17	19	0	0	0
928	7	7	Arsenal of the Brave	Kitsui no Zouheishou	The final progression is celebrated by a ceremonial duel between sensei and student, in which the latter has risen to meet the former.The Seventh Stage is more than just an evolved form of the Boomerang Style, emphasising longer rebound chains using any part of the Bo, but a fusion of the principles from all six prior Stages into an expert juggling act. Rapid spins, performed as easily and sturdily through the air as across the body, transition seamlessly into slaps, jabs and spears, through which even uncapped Bo staves bear enough controlled pressure to pierce boulders, all the while matching the effortless, sure-footed dance of the wielder.To the initiated, watching a Seventh Stage combatant confirms the true power of the imagination. To the uninitiated, it becomes the most enthralling of spectacles, the air around the practitioner verily churning with a cloud of motion as attacks rise from hidden wells of inspiration and evasions disperse along impossible trajectories like smoke through one's fingers. The body of the new master has now been honed into the perfect partner to the Bo. Lithe and unyielding, the shinobi is strong alone but near-insurmountable in their hybrid duality.The balance between unarmed and Bo strikes has more or less evened out, and the form taken by an assault becomes a matter of opportunity and strategy. By this point, a punch correctly applied to the ribcage could break bones while a well-placed spinning kick to the face might dislocate an opponent's jaw entirely. This is, true to form, the handiwork of a relentless dervish rather than a juggernaut of destruction. Yet it is arguably as effective at incapacitating an enemy when the value of self-preservation is accounted for, and it is this enviable longevity that has allowed the very few masters of Kitsui no Zouheishou to survive for so long.	4	4	1			24	30	45	0	20	24	0	0	0
927	1	1	Dance of the Three Arms	San Hyoujou no Byou	-Simply a beginner, the user cannot even begin to fathom the ways in which they can effectively use their sansetsukon. Rather, the genin uses the unique weapon to wildly beat enemies away, and has neither real grace nor form.-Joumae: This system of the style is the only one that can be utilized at this stage, and the user begins to memorize basic attack and defense patterns, thrusts, parries, and other useful spear habits. However, because of a lack of experience, the adept still uses his spear quite wildly, unpredictably, and ineffectively in battle.-Anrokku: The complexities of the three-part staff are too great at this stage to begin to comprehend, and as such, the user is limited to using the joumae system of this style and cannot competently use a sansetsukon in its unlocked form quite yet.	4	5		Thrust-A simple stab that is performed quickly with a spear, before being pulled back to parry a blow or perform another thrust. Basically, these are chainable, and they gain effectiveness when the user grows in strength.Parry-The user uses the long reach of his weapon to brush aside other weapons. Nothing more, nothing less.		4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
927	2	2	Dance of the Three Arms	San Hyoujou no Byou	-Now progressing the style, the user has unlocked the potential to use both the Joumae and Anrokku portions of his sansetsukon, albeit rather awkwardly.-Joumae: The user progresses, and has memorized most basic spear habits and can effectively use them in battle. In addition, thrust speed and parrying speed have both increased, allowing for quick stabs that can slip through an opponent's defense. However, because the user is wielding such a long weapon, there are still some awkward moments where they can be caught unprepared and defenseless.-Anrokku: As the user has just breached this system of the style, movements are quite awkward. Grasping the sansetsukon at the connector chains, the genin can utilize the sections as limbs of sorts, parrying short-range weapons and fists. However, the user can become tangled up in their weapon, causing for awkward moments. At the moment, the adept will keep both hands on the sansetsukon in this system of the style, limiting the range he can hit with the limbs.*The user can unlock or lock (only one) his staff in one post, meaning he could use the Joumae system (1 post), unlock his staff (1 post), and then use the Anrokku system, or vice versa.	4	5		Cross Catch Vise-Using the limbs of the sansetsukon, the user crosses them into an X, and catches a falling weapon or fist meant to cause them harm. Then, they apply pressure to the captured item, squeezing it like a vise between the two limbs and immobilizing that limb/blade.		7	7	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
927	3	3	Dance of the Three Arms	San Hyoujou no Byou	-This style is the bridge between mediocrity and brilliance in this style, and is a pivotal point in the user's career. At this stage, the user gains the ability to use the Joumae and Anrokku systems interchangeably, increasing attack variance and unpredictability; two aspects of a warrior which are extremely important. As such, one special technique is left open to the aspiring warrior.-Joumae: The user is becoming an able spearman, able to stave off multiple opponents with their long reach and skill. The point of their staff is one to be feared, for it darts quickly and stings hard. The only problem that could be encountered here is the fact that a warrior might slip under the user's guard and attack them, but even this fear is tempered by the fact that the user is able to utilize the Anrokku system alongside this one.-Anrokku: Finally, the user becomes mildly competent in the real use of the sansetsukon. A two-handed grip as well as a one-handed grip, is used to deal blunt and whipping damage. In addition, weapons can be caught and turned aside by proper application of previous techniques, but the user still cannot use the chains connecting the limbs to entangle weapons, as this proves to be too difficult in the heat of battle.*The user can use the Joumae system in one post, and the Anrokku in the next.	4	5		Flying Dragon Whip-Using a one-handed grip, the user seemingly tosses the sansetsukon at his opponent, piercing their body with the bladed end, or heavily bruising them with a blindingly fast whip-strike.		9	11	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
927	4	4	Dance of the Three Arms	San Hyoujou no Byou	-At this point, the user is making real strides in his quality as a warrior. Improvisation on the battlefield is becoming subconscious with continual practice, and with the fluid nature of the sansetsukon, it is almost impossible for shinobi of the same rank or lesser to predict where the next attack might hit.-Joumae: At this stage, there is a simple refinement of this system in comparison to the last stage, with new attack and defense patterns being learned.-Anrokku: This stage is a point where the user begins to rely more on the Anrokku system for combat, as it is becoming the more versatile portion of this style. In addition to all the previous capabilities of this system, the adept learns how to catch bladed weapons and limbs in chains connecting the sansetsukon's limbs and immobilize them, or turn them aside. The staff is also seen to be used more like a rigid whip at this level of proficiency.	4	5		Chained Fang-Catching a limb or blade in the chains connecting the limbs of their staff, the user twists the chain and holds fast, effectively restraining an opponent's offense.		15	18	10	0	14	0	0	0	0
927	5	5	Dance of the Three Arms	San Hyoujou no Byou	-This level marks near mastery for a user, who is skilled in both systems of the style and can use them effectively; the only deficiencies a user might be blamed as having is the fact that he lacks the stamina that some shinobi might have. However, the adept balances this with the fact that he is much quicker than many others. As personal style is developing here at this stage, a special technique is left open for further customization.-Joumae: Again, a refinement of the last stage, with quicker, more accurate movements with the user being able to pinpoint areas on an opponents body that, if pierced, would either cripple them or kill them.-Anrokku: The user develops his own flare at this point, and again refines this system to focus on precision strikes and powerful blows.	4	5				20	22	14	0	16	0	0	0	0
927	6	6	Dance of the Three Arms	San Hyoujou no Byou	-Again, a simple refinement of both systems, and an increasing capability to function at higher speeds, as well as gaining more physical strength and stamina.	4	5				27	30	18	16	20	0	0	0	0
927	7	7	Dance of the Three Arms	San Hyoujou no Byou	-Simply put: mastery. Seamless and flawless integration of systems, as well as a unique flare and sense of style. Ultimately, the user is an unpredictable fighting machine who dominates the battlefield with skill, guile and strategy.	4	5				37	40	22	19	25	0	0	0	0
926	1	1	Dance of the Underworld	Yomi no Buyou	The user learns how to wield his spear correctly i.e. getting used how to hold it properly and move without it being too much of a burden and hindrance to his newly acquired speed. Countering attacks at this level, although very much possible, is limited to parrying while holding one's ground by holding the spear across. At this stage, no attack other than a simple forward thrust is possible.		5	4			0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
926	2	2	Dance of the Underworld	Yomi no Buyou	With the basics grasped, the practitioner is now ready to go one step further in his mastering of the 'dance'. Now possessing nimbler footwork and being more dexterous while handling the spear, the user can parry attacks either while advancing on his enemy or while back-pedaling. Offensive options are now even wider due to the higher level of expertise in spear mastery. In addition to the normal thrust, it's now possible to instantly follow up with another attack from that position.		5	4			0	8	6	0	6	0	0	0	0
926	3	3	Dance of the Underworld	Yomi no Buyou	This stage marks the point where the style evolves into one of deceit and optical illusions, becoming heavily reliant on feints to work properly. Since it's impossible for someone at this level to have got rid of the many openings in his defense, there is the need to 'give the impression' that he has only a few of them. Speed having risen by a fair amount since initiation, the user is now capable to moving his arms (and spear, in the process) so fast that it creates the illusion of him having more limbs than it is really the case. The enemy, fooled into thinking the Yomi no Buyou practitioner can parry most of his blows, will reassess his attacking options. The user, however, can only remain stationary when performing this move. A maximum of 2 'shadow limbs' can be made.		5	4	Hametsu e no Rondo (A Rondo towards Destruction)Having acquired a higher degree of control when it comes to handling the spear, the user is able to completely turn otherwise seemingly precarious situations to his advantage. A rather basic counter attack, the Rondo towards Destruction is performed exclusively against weapon specialists. As the enemy charges at you, weapon in hand, you thrust the blunt end of your spear forward, aiming for his fingers gripping the weapon. The impact will cause the opponent to release his grip, thus negating the attack - also leaving him without his main defense and wide open for an eventual strike with the sharpened end of the spear.		0	11	9	0	8	0	0	0	0
926	4	4	Dance of the Underworld	Yomi no Buyou	Now literally able to juggle with that long weapon, the spear dancer is presented with numerous options for defensive and offensive moves. The disconcerting ease and speed with which one is able to handle the pole arm only serves to reinforce the guard of the user; however, given that it's still a long way to go towards perfection, there is still the necessity to have recourse to 'illusions'. But while the maximum number of 'shadow limbs' which can be made is still 2, the user now possesses such control in spear handling that he is able to wield two of them at the same time (one in each hand) with the same ease and dexterity which would be required for a single one.		5	4	Hametsu e no Tango (A Tango towards Destruction)Considered to be a variation of the Rondo towards Destruction, the Hametsu e no Tango differs mainly in that it requires dual wielding spears to be executed. The basic concept remains the same as in the Rondo, the aim being to get the opponent to release his weapon: control is high enough for such a feat to be possible while handling the spear with a single hand. The subsequent, almost simultaneous, attack coming from the second spear, is thus more lethal than in the case of the Rondo where there is a delay between creating the opening and striking.		10	18	15	0	14	0	0	0	0
926	5	5	Dance of the Underworld	Yomi no Buyou	It is at this level that the most dramatic change in movements is observed - the swiftness of both footwork and especially spear manoeuvres having gone up significantly. The dexterity with which one can now wield his spear(s) is virtually perfect, leaving very few openings in one's guard. And as if this wasn't sufficient, the speed of these movements is such that it renders the created optical illusions more potent that ever, the user being able to give the impression that he now has up to eight arms able to both parry and initiate attacks from almost every angle and position. Once more, this move can only be performed if the user remains stationary; even at this level, it is not possible for someone to spin his spears that fast while moving at the same time lest impaling himself with them.		5	4	Yomi no Yari (Spears of the Underworld)This technique is basically a spin-off of the ability to create the multiple illusionary limbs, the twist being that it is used offensively. Following the same concept, 'Spears of the Underworld' involves extremely fast jabs with the spear(s) towards the opponent, thus creating yet another optical illusion where it is extremely hard to distinguish between the real attacks and the mirror images.Kyuuzou (Surge)While 'Spears of the Underworld' is dependent on speedy movements of the arms to make swift jabs while stationary, 'Surge' is a technique which allows the user to dash in a given direction at blistering speed for a distance not exceeding 3 metres, usually followed by a deadly attack with the spear(s).		12	26	18	0	16	0	0	0	0
926	6	6	Dance of the Underworld	Yomi no Buyou	With the practitioner having practically mastered the ability to handle the spear(s) at very high speed, focus during training is now put on having an even better control - in an attempt to eliminate the need to hold one's ground at all times while using the demonic speed to create illusions. For this reason, a bigger emphasis is put on physical strength to allow the spear dancer to both move at high speed and wield his weapon as the same dexterity as if it were under normal circumstances.		5	4		Hatmesu e no Enbu (A Waltz towards Destruction)Testament of the true demonic speed acquired by the user at this level, the Waltz towards Destruction nonetheless follows the same principle as most of the Yomi no Buyou abilities i.e. creating optical illusions by moving at vertiginous speeds. Instead of just fake replicas of limbs, it is now possible through swift movements to create several mirror images of oneself to fool the opponent. A passive technique once this level of skill is reached, this ability is truly devastating in that it can be combined with virtually any other skill in the arsenal of the ninja.Note: The mirror images can only be created in the user's wake, that is along the path/course he has moved beforehand.	20	30	25	0	18	18	0	0	0
926	7	7	Dance of the Underworld	Yomi no Buyou	The final stage of the Yomi no Buyou, which also coincides with complete mastery. The few people who did manage to reach that level of skill were rumoured to leave no opening at all in their defense. And although it might be deemed impossible to reach such perfection, it might not be that farfetched a claim assuming the practitioner can compensate for the rare weaknesses he has through the use of even more developed optical illusions.		5	4			29	35	35	0	22	22	0	0	0
925	1	1	First Lord's Charge	Kan Joutei Yari	The most important and easy to grasp techniques are learned first. First Lord's Charge was originally intended to be taught to peasants who could do little else but hold a sharp stick, and this stage represents the peak of where most of those folks would end up. Simple strikes and blocks are mastered along with a small but useful array of spear techniques which require almost no skill to perform correctly. The goal here is not finesse or power, but practicality.	4	5		Plant and Point: The spear-wielder takes a low stance, bracing the spear against the ground or their own body and pointing the sharp end towards a charging enemy. The aim is to impale the enemy using their own momentum. Because it requires nothing more than standing still, this technique uses almost no stamina, strength, or skill to perform. Famously used by King Artoria's bastard daughter to slay her.Dismount: A quick, wide, swinging motion is made with the weapon, with the aim of catching and pulling a target using the hooked end of a spear. Usually used to unseat foes on horseback, or for spear fishing.Skirmisher's Salvo Any polearm can be hurled as if it were a javelin. Aiming is done for the center of mass of targets, as typically javelins tend to not be that precise or accurate.	Last Lord's Charge: Once per Charge, the user may delay the effects of an injury or stat penalty until the end of the charge. The damage/penalties are then doubled at the end of the Charge.Improvised Phalanx: This technique can only be used after attacking a Sworn target. Allies within arms reach of the user gain 1 additional Level to all Physicals stats. When the allies leave the range of this technique, they suffer a loss of 1 Physical Level to all stats for 1 post, to a minimum of 1. This technique remains active until there are no allies within reach of the user.	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
925	2	2	First Lord's Charge	Kan Joutei Yari	A focus on one-on-one combat and 'flashier' techniques coming to the foray as shinobi influence begins to seep into the style. Typically this is where those interested in mounted combat would first get a horse and learn the ins and outs of taking care and riding it. A number of simple acrobatics are learned such as pole vaulting or jump boosting with the polearm, and a basic system of parries and short thrusts are mastered somewhat reminiscent of fencing styles.	4	5		Deflect Defense: With practice the user gains a muscle memory with their weapon such that when it bounces off a hard surface they know exactly where their weapon will next arc towards. The most common use of this is to ricochet a javelin off a wall. This skill extends to held weapons as well, letting the user intercept and bounce the tip of their weapon off several incoming attacks or projectiles at once with a single swing.Winds of War: By spinning the polearm a small, pleasant breeze can be generated. This wind doesn't do more than blow up an obscuring cloud of dust and can block mundane projectiles thrown by those without projectile training. By adding a specialized tassel to the end of the spear this technique can also be used to slow down one's descent in a manner similar to a parachute, effectively allowing the user to fall for one post without harming themselves.Pole Dancing:A set of flexible, fluid movements can be learned here, standing opposed to the more rigid stances elsewhere in the style. This stance utilizes wide, sweeping motions and undulating body movements intended to aid slashing and tripping attacks. While seen as a joke by many die-hard fans of Kan Joutei Yari, this method is undeniably efficient at controlling crowds consisting of many unskilled opponents.	Jousting Duel: The polearm is raised and its point locked onto a target who is typically several dozen feet away. The user then charges and smashes their polearm into said target, typically shattering it in the process. If the user is Charging and attacks a target moving at a higher Speed level than themselves, their attack hits with 2 additional Strength Levels. Scholars say these methods were first perfected by King Artoria's strongest knight, who would eventually go on to betray her.Oath to Order: If an ally is injured in the thread, the user may swear an oath to protect them. For the rest of the thread the user gains 2 Physical Levels in all stats whenever they attack a Sworn target. If the individual the user is trying to protect gets injured, the user suffers a penalty of 1 to all Physical Levels for 1 post, to a minimum of 1.	0	7	7	0	6	0	0	0	0
925	3	3	First Lord's Charge	Kan Joutei Yari	With the basics mastered, now comes the refinement and development of advanced techniques. Some folks introduce modifications to their weapons at this style, such as telescoping shafts or chains to extend reach. Mixing and matching horizontal, axe-like attacks with thrusting stabs is also a common sight, as switching tactics on the fly becomes necessary against an ever enlarging variety of potential opponents. Even patently absurd styles like dual wielding polearms can be started here, though such stances are usually ill-advised.	4	5		By Any Other Name : The user may fight with any weapon or item they have on hand as if it was a spear, and use any regular or special techniques they know with that item. Desperation has driven First Lord Charge practitioners to using fishing rods, rakes, and even street signs as improvised weapons. Folk tales say this style was used by Waterfall Country's Lord Jaki alongside a ladder to humiliate his enemies.Spare the Rod: Twisting a weapon when it sustains a strong impact can help mitigate otherwise crippling blows. Once per weapon an attack that would otherwise destroy the weapon, won't.Pike Pulchritude: Any time a Sworn enemy is impaled by the user, allies within eyesight may become either horrified or inspired, and can ignore all pain in their following post. This technique was first popularized by a warlord known by his enemies as 'Lord D', with the meaning of 'D' since lost to time.	Fast Lord's Charge: Every post the user is Charging they can gain 2 additional Levels to a Physical stat. The moment the user is no longer Charging, all physical levels drop to 1 and the user must remain completely immobile and cannot take any actions at all for a single post to catch their breath.Peltast Pummel: Javelins or spear-like weapons can be thrown with the same ease and accuracy as smaller, more conventional projectiles. When Charging, the user's spear-like projectiles travel at their current Speed Levels plus 2.	0	10	10	0	8	0	0	0	0
925	4	4	First Lord's Charge	Kan Joutei Yari	Here begins the honing of multiple-opponent fighting skills. Halberds, scythes and other half-axe type polearms work best, but even the small blade of the common spear can be used for large sweeping attacks aimed at many enemies at once. A skilled warrior on horseback can cleave through entire fronts of enemies with massive, powerful swings when aided by their beast's speed. Even on foot these enormous arcing attacks are dangerous and are known for causing foe and ally alike to panic from the indiscriminate carnage they wreak on the battlefield.	4	5		Scissor Strike: Invented and proliferated by the renegade Rain shinobi Lord Tenma, the scissor technique simply uses a polearm in each hand and brings them both together down at the same point. The exact application of force can catch weapons in mid-strike, or cleave through softer materials with twice the depth as a normal attack.Around the Bend: After jamming the sharp end of their spear far into the ground or into a wall the polearm's shaft is bent backwards to just before its breaking point. When the shaft is let free the force is released all at once. This can be used to launch unorthodox projectiles, to fling the user like a springboard, or to smack those who get too close.Legionary Limb: If an ally is Charging within eyesight of the user, they may use any regular technique Stage Four and below from this list, assuming they have an appropriate weapon.	Spear Sensei: If a spear or spear-like weapon from the user's inventory is given to another person in the thread, and one post is spent by the user teaching the recipient how to use it, that person may use First Lord's Charge special techniques Stage Four and below within the thread. This effect is lost if the recipient loses possession of the spear at any time.From on High: Once per weapon, the user may throw their spear with perfect accuracy at any Sworn target in eyesight.	13	16	14	0	14	0	0	0	0
925	5	5	First Lord's Charge	Kan Joutei Yari	Those who reach this stage are often referred to as 'Lords', so great their skills on the battlefield have become. More than just martial skills, by now the First Lord's Charge master is becoming a leader worthy of the title. The capacity to command large armies comes to fruition and a number of soft skills necessary for successful warfare are acquired. A field of tools are now at their fingertips: managing supply lines, building camps, understanding battle fronts, the manipulation of formations, overseeing the construction of siege engines, and an in depth knowledge of the history of warfare. Different individuals manifest their Lordship in different ways; some are skirmishers, some are front line cavalry, and some may never leave their desk again. It takes all types to win a war.	4	5		Slapstick: A number of acrobatic spinning, flipping, and rotating attacks are learned. This stance tends to be more 'theatrical' in nature, having its roots in stage plays and ritualistic spear fighting rather than actual warfare. The signature style of Waterfall Country's legendary thespian, Lord Jaki.Rallying Cry: The user gives a mighty shout, sometimes accompanied by an order or a longer speech. The effect of this depends entirely on the user's own charisma and speaking ability, but objectively their voice will be understood and heard even over the most chaotic of situations in 200 foot radius.Standard Bearer: A flag or coat of arms is flown or added onto on a polearm. This makes handling the polearm much more difficult due to the weight and drag produced by the extra material. However, the sight of the banner can rally troops, reinvigorating to fight harder. Those who see the user fighting Sworn enemies with the banner may choose to feel no fear so long as the banner is present. Used to great effect by the peasant turned folk hero Lord Jannu to bolster her troops.	Fist Lord's Charge: While Charging, if the user draws blood from a hostile enemy, in the following post they may perform an additional offensive action with their weapon. When no longer Charging, the user becomes immensely tired, and cannot use any taijutsu special techniques or jutsu for 3 posts.Armchair General: If a post and action are taken to give advice to a person or group of people, all those who listen and earnestly try to follow said advice can have their Strength, Speed, or Stamina boosted by 2 levels until they take damage. After taking damage the technique is canceled and the same stat is decreased by 2 levels for 2 posts to a minimum of 1. Allegedly the technique that was the undoing of the First Lord after he angered his soldiers by inadvertently insulting their fighting technique while trying to be helpful.	18	20	18	0	16	0	0	0	0
925	6	6	First Lord's Charge	Kan Joutei Yari	The physical ability and skill with polearms of all types has now reached its apex. One handed grips, two handed, with a shield or an offhand blade, fighting one or five or a hundred, there is little the user has not already experienced and overcome by now. If the user is a rider, their mounted combat capabilities are unparalleled, almost as if the animal and master are a single organism. This is the stopping point of many, as this level represents the most that a mere human can hope to achieve in both body and mind.	4	5		Grand Order: Fielding large forces requires a significant amount of infrastructure and skillful management of battlefield logistics. While the humble student of First Lord's Charge is unlikely to ever possess such immense resources they still gain an encyclopedic knowledge on the more bean-counting aspects of warfare. In combat these skills are negligible, but outside of the battlefield the user can become something of a polymath in the many topics which involve war, even if they themselves are unaware of it.The Hedgehog: Each and every polearm or spear in the user's inventory may be 'wielded' at the same time without losing combat effectiveness. One in each hand is a given, but others may be strapped to the back of the torso, to the legs, to the elbows, or even held in the mouth. In effect the user becomes a one-man phalanx formation. The name came from the mocking taunts of enemies eventually routed by Valley Country's Lord Kokoro the Brave, the originator of this technique.Golgotha: This may be used any time in place of a killing blow. A target is impaled in a specific location near the heart. As long as the target remains impaled in such a way, their body is completely paralyzed (apart from talking and breathing), and they will not succumb to death from exsanguination. The target can still die, just not from the wound. If the polearm is removed at any time, the target instantly expires, and even the advanced medical arts of shinobi cannot save them. Said to be Lord D's favorite technique and the method by which he was eventually executed for his war crimes.	Burned at the Stake: Special oil is poured over the blade or point of weapon beforehand, which is then ignited by striking it against another piece of metal. The inflamed blade or spear-head can then pierce through metal for a single post. If Charging, this effect lasts as long as the charge does. However this irreversibly damages the edge of the weapon, rendering it dull for the rest of the thread. This method was used twenty-nine times to execute the legendary folk hero Lord Jannu after she was accused and convicted of heresy.Shear Force: As an expert in polearms, the user can now effortlessly craft low-quality versions of their weapons with nothing more than a few seconds and a sharp edge. Using a blade the user can cut off pieces of material and quickly whittle them into sharp javelins or spears. This can be done so fast that the weapon may be created then used in an attack in the same post. Materials such as wood or bone work best for sturdy polearms, whereas materials like glass or bamboo work excellent for projectiles. Harder materials like stone or metal can even be crafted into spear points, though the shaft must still be some kind of softer material.	22	30	23	0	20	16	0	0	0
925	7	7	First Lord's Charge	Kan Joutei Yari	Those select few who survive long enough are by now legends in their own right. To study fighting is no longer necessary. After all, by now the user will have likely lived through every lesson in the book. The First Lord's Charge student is the embodiment of war itself. Be warned, great master. Most who have reached this peak do not die in battle, but rather by assassination or execution. There is little other way to deal with a person of such rank, and many a friend has been turned to an enemy simply from the fear that a Lord's ambition can inspire.	4	5		Knighthood: By spending a post to 'knight' a fellow consenting ally into their service (in whatever way suits the user), that ally's loyalty will become unwavering. Effectively, this technique grants Knights 4 levels of Genjutsu training, which does not stack with already existing Genjutsu training.Kingdom Come: While a world-wide reputation may still elude the Lord, the right people already know all about them. If desired the user may suddenly find themselves adopted by or being courted by suitors from a distant royal family, usually outside of their country of origin. This comes with a title deed to a small, usually poor fief, which provides a trickle of extra finances, and a distant but tangible seat in some manner of royal succession.Gae Bolg Every strike with their polearm rings true, letting the Lord manipulate the edge of their weapon as a surgeon does a scalpel. Even the tiniest of openings can be slipped through and exploited, so precise and dexterous the user has become. Old legends tell of an ancient unnamed Lord slaying a giant with a single thrust of his spear, piercing its skull through a crack in its tooth. True story or not, the feat is certainly feasible for one at this level of skill. Once per thread, if a blow is landed on a Sworn target, all defensive techniques or armor they possess can be ignored.	Lance of Longinus: A single, immensely powerful throw is made with any polearm at Sworn target. This destroys the weapon, but allows it to strike with a Speed and Strength Level equal to three times the item's cost in item points.First Lord's Charge: After making a rallying cry, if the user is Charging, every ally or animal who is also Charging in the same direction has their Physical Levels raised to match the user's. When this technique finishes, all those affected apart from the user are so exhausted no offensive of defensive actions can be taken for one post.	32	38	29	0	26	18	0	0	0
924	1	1	Whisper of the Shinigami 	Shinigami no Teisei	Striking Ability: At this stage, the user just gets used to the kamas and have no real control over it yet. Without the needed control, the user is only able to make simple striking attacks, without being able to stop or adjust the attack in any way. The attacks are mostly to keep the attack at bay, while one can only hope to catch the opponent off guard. Strength here is mostly through the momentum of the swinging motion. The user is only able to attack with one kama at a time.Defense: Blocking, at this stage, is difficult since the user is only learning to control the kama. Here, the user mostly has to rely on dodging as he still gets used to the shape of the weapon.	4	5		Mugoi Kiritateru (Brutal Slash)A simple horizontal slash using the momentum of the strike to inflict damage on the opponent. Rather simple to dodge.Uwayurasu (Upward Swing)A simple vertical slash using the momentum of the strike to inflict damage. Even though of its name, this technique goes both from up to down or visa verse. Simple to dodge.		3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
924	2	2	Whisper of the Shinigami 	Shinigami no Teisei	Striking Ability: Control over the kama has improved greatly, with the user being able to perform slashing motions with both scythes at the same time. Additionally, the user is now capable to change the course of the blade while swinging, making it possible to stop half-way or change to a defense position. The strength of the slashes still rely mostly on the momentum of the attack.Defense: The control earned in this stage, makes the user able to deflect simple attacks from weapons, but he lacks the needed strength to go in a duel with other weapon users. Neither is the user able to block projectile weapons.	4	5		Bouseki no Kirimi (Spinning Slice)The user holds both scythes straight out from their body in opposite directions, then spins. This technique is simple to execute and simpler to dodge, but the balance and coordination needed for this technique is an important building block for more advanced techniquesKitotsuki (Returning Moon)With the right angle, the user is able to throw one scythe at his opponent, while it will return just like a boomerang. The user must wait 1 post until the kama returns to him, but if he plays it right, he can use the delay to catch his opponent off guard.	Special Techniques Requirement: Tactics 4, Willpower 4Oniba (Fang)The user channels chakra along their weapons, invisibly lengthening the blades by up to 4 inches. This technique can be used alone, but is usually used as part of a more advanced technique.	6	8	0	0	0	6	0	0	0
924	3	3	Whisper of the Shinigami 	Shinigami no Teisei	Striking Ability: No longer has the user to rely on the momentum of his strikes. The user is now capable to limited movement during their strikes, without losing its strength. Control only gains a little boost, giving the user the ability to attack in different directions.Defense: Defense makes a huge step in this stage, as the user finally is able to deflect incoming blows and even hold himself against his attacker in a duel. This is mostly done, by catching the sword inside the scythes while crossing them. Projectile weapons still are a problem to the user and he can only block them if they are easy to sight, and only if the user is not distracted.	4	5		Shiza-katto (Scissors Cut)The user crosses his arms, that the scythes blade's are at his side, and makes a swift step forwards while slashing horizontally with his scythes at the opponent. The user normally targets the opponents abdomen and trained users can even separate the legs and upper-body, cutting the opponent into half.Ryuuki Hasami (Rising Scissors)Similar like Shiza-katto, the user crosses his hands while one scythe is right his head and the other one at his left side. Slashing vertically with his kamas the user aims to slice the opponent into half.Haritsuke (Crucifixion)This technique utilizes both scythes. The user first slashes horizontally with his right scythe, closely followed with a vertical slash with the right scythe. Normally is the vertical strike performed from down to the top.	Special Techniques Requirement: Tactics 7, Willpower 7, Intelligence 6Utsutsu: Ichi (Evisceration: One)Requirements: Oniba (Fang)This attack is similar to Fang Spin, but differs in some regards. The user first spins, aiming for the target's chest without charging their blades. After completing the spin, the user lunges in close to the target and lengthens their blade with chakra, slicing deep across the enemy's abdomen.Shisou (Shadow of Death)This technique creates a sphere of darkness 5 feet in radius, into which no light can travel. The sphere will maintain itself for 3 posts, then disappear, and is completely immobile. This technique only has minor combat application on its own, but more advanced skills often use a zone of darkness as a foundation.Shin no Teisei (Whisper of Death)This technique causes the target to feel the sudden notion that they're about to die. The technique will give the target a moment's pause as they contemplate whether to run from battle. The technique can only be initiated if the user makes eye contact with the target. A target with a higher willpower than the user will not be affected by this technique.	10	10	0	0	0	8	0	0	0
924	4	4	Whisper of the Shinigami 	Shinigami no Teisei	Striking Ability: Control over the movement of the scythes stays pretty much the same. However, with the usage of spins, the user is now able to add momentum to the blade without actually having to make sweeping attacks at his opponent. The wounds inflicted at this stage cut deep into the flesh and, if aimed right, can easily become fatal.Defense: Not only has the user reached the ability to block and deflect incoming attacks, but now he is also able to counter attack. Catching incoming blades (no cleaver weapons) between the blade and the handle of the scythe, the user can slash with the other kama at his opponent. There is no real change if attacked by projectiles, with the only difference that he now can block even hard to view objects (i.e.: senbons).	4	5		Ryuuketsu (Bloodshed)The user rushes at the opponent while slashing vertically, horizontal, and diagonally, letting lose a whole barrage of attacks aimed to inflict damage and drive the opponent into the defensive.	Special Techniques Requirement: Tactics 10, Willpower 10, Intelligence 8Mononoke no Shin (Spectre of Death)Requirements: Shin no Teisei (Whisper of Death)This technique causes the target to see a momentary illusion of the God of Death behind the user. The technique will instill fear into the opponent, making them more cautions when fighting, effectively slowing down their movements. This technique requires the user make eye contact with the target.Utsusu: Ni (Evisceration: Two)Requirements: Utsutsu: Ichi (Evisceration: One)This technique begins with the user creating a ball of darkness that covers both themselves and their enemy through use of the Shisou technique, then lengthening their blades by way of the Fang technique. The user then strike, slashing both blades across the enemy's abdomen. Both the user and the target are effectively blinded during this technique.	14	17	12	0	0	14	0	0	0
924	5	5	Whisper of the Shinigami 	Shinigami no Teisei	Striking Ability: The user's control over the scythes improved greatly at this stage. Now he can use spins and cuts with great ease, using one or both scythes to inflict deep wounds without having to rely on the momentum anymore.Defense: There is no real change to the previous stage: The user still can block, deflect and counter strike. The only difference is, that now the user is able to block some (3-4) projectiles weapons, even if he is not concentrating on them, just using his reflexes.	4	5		Kuro Ikazuchi (Black Thunder)The user leaps into the air, jumping over the opponent. Once he reaches the right apex, he slashes with both scythes at the back of his opponent. This technique is only seldom used more then once, since it leave the user wide open while jumping.	Special Techniques Requirement: Tactics 15, Willpower 15, Intelligence 13Kurai no Kousa (Dark Cross)Requirements: Shisou (Shadow of Death)First, the user creates a small sphere of shadow 'attached' to the enemy's head. The user then charges their blades with chakra as per the Cross Fang technique, with one small modification - the blades fluoresce brightly, giving off a brilliant silver light. The light, due partially to its sheer intensity and partially to its chakra-created nature, is able to partially penetrate the darkness - when the user's blades are within 5 feet of the target, they will be plainly visible as crescents of light. The user then executes the Cross Fang move. The darkness surrounding the target will be dispersed as soon as either of the user's blades touches the target or a weapon wielded by the target, or after 5 seconds.Dark HarvestRequirements: Utsusu: Ni (Evisceration: Two)The user begins by a technique akin to the Evisceration technique. First, the user performs a spin attack aimed at the enemy's chest, then stops momentarily to charge their blades with chakra in an identical manner to the Talon technique. Once charged, the user lunges past the enemy while making a sweeping attack at the enemy's neck designed to decapitate the target.	18	22	16	0	0	16	0	0	0
924	6	6	Whisper of the Shinigami 	Shinigami no Teisei	Striking Ability: No real change at this stage, the user now can execute more complex slashes as before.Defense: With this stage, the user gains a new defensive move. Now he is able to catch incoming blades (no cleavers) like he did with his counter move, with one difference: using both scythes to catch it, the user can make a quick twist of his kamas and might be able to disarm his opponent.	4	5		Makai Wana (Hell Trap)The user takes on a defensive stance: He moves his right arm so, that the scythe his left of his head, next he moves his left hand that his second scythe is next to his right hip. If someone launches an weapon attack, the user will make a swift move and trap the incoming weapon inside the kamas. Unlike the normal counter attack, the user traps the weapon inside making it possible to comrades to attack the defenseless opponent.	Special Techniques Requirement: Tactics 19, Willpower 19, Intelligence 18Kaiki (Total Eclipse)Requirements: Dark HarvestThe user throws both chakra enforced Scythes like boomerangs one after the other. The first one, called Tsuki (moon) comes from the right hand and returns to the left hand. The second, called Ohisama (the sun) comes from the left, and returns to the right hand. Both of them slash everything it can in its path. The point where the two tumbling scythes cross, when the sun and the moon are superimposed, is where the true power of this move is revealed. Anyone who looks directly at the eclipse point as the scythes cross will be completely blinded. The blindness is not permanent, however, but will last for several minutes (2 posts) before it begins to clear. The affected person's vision will take a further 1 post (3 posts from the time of effect) to clear completely. The blindness is completely irreversible, except for gradually healing over time.Kousa no Shinigami (Cross Reaper)Requirements: Mononoke no Shin (Spectre of Death)This move has the user first create an illusion of Shinigami, then cause the illusion to reach a hand toward the target. Once the arm gets within close proximity (5 feet or so) of the target, the illusion is dispelled and the target, having concealed their motion behind the illusion, performs the Cross Fang technique from close range, preventing the opponent from dodging effectively, due mostly to the lingering effects of seeing Shinigami.Tsume (Talon)Requirements: Oniba (Fang)This technique is an advanced form of the edge-honing technique Fang. With this technique, the user is able to sharpen the edges of both their blades to a level known as 'mono-molecular,' meaning the blade's leading edge is comprised of a single molecule and is thus able to cut through most known materials like a hot knife through butter. While active, the user can move their scythes through the air at 1.5x normal swing speed due to the incredibly low air resistance caused by the weapons' ability to literally cut through the air. This technique is highly draining on both concentration and chakra, however, so can only be maintained for quick bursts (3 seconds or less), for no more than a total time of 20 seconds per day.	24	32	19	0	14	18	0	0	0
924	7	7	Whisper of the Shinigami 	Shinigami no Teisei	Striking Ability: The final stage. People reaching this stage of the Shinigami no Teisei are often revered to as Shinigami's Child, a name truly earned by those legendary people. The control over the kamas has reached perfection, with the right tactic, the user could easily cut off his opponent's body parts or dismember them into nothing but pieces.Defense: Defense is now nearly perfect as he has reached complete control over the scythes. The user takes full advantage over the easy weight of the scythes, to perform blocks and counter attacks (even cleaver weapons) with ease. Projectile weapons can be blocked while fighting another opponent.	4	5			Special Techniques Requirement: Tactics 26, Willpower 25, Intelligence 24Soul HarvestRequirements: All Special TechniquesThis technique has the user create an illusion of Shinigami that reaches out toward the target. The user is hidden within the spectre's hand, and charges their blades to beyond Talon sharpness. The spectre's hand passes through the target, still concealing the user. The user, when he passes the target, sweeps through the target with scythes honed beyond even monomolecular sharpness - sharp enough to pass through a human body without disturbing it. Wounds will cut deep, bringing a great likelihood (90%) of immediate unconsciousness. Those who can withstand the power of the blow, and not lose conscious, will realize that the attack not only harmed their body, but their spirit too, making the target unable to mold any chakra for the duration of 2 posts.Those truly trained in the Shinigami no Teisei, can attack not only the body, but the soul. At least it seems as if the user was capable to steal the target's soul. In truth, the user aims for specific points on the human body which reacts to the chakra the scythe is charged with, killing the target.((This effect (instant death) needs the approval of the target, of course.))This technique requires an incredible amount of chakra to perform, and can only be used once a battle, also it will render the user unable to perform additional chakra-consuming moves for 2 posts due to exhaustion.	36	40	23	0	19	25	0	0	0
923	1	1	Teachings of the Shinigami	Shinigami no Oshie	Striking Ability: The starting level only allows simple strikes and slashes, which use more the momentum of the attack than the real strength of the user. While the sweeping attacks are useful to clear the area from opponents or keep them away, but only if the user is standing firm on the ground to brace against the momentum's strength.Defense: Defense at this stage is nearly non-existent. With the user only getting familiar with the weapon, he has to rely on dodging. Only the simplest of attacks might be blocked, though many users lost balance while doing so.Movement: The user only starts learning to use the scythe properly, still he is already able to side step untrained attackers with great ease, thought it looks awkward. Strikes are rough and slow, making them easily to dodge by trained taijutsu users.	5	4		Funkei (Decapitation)The user performs a horizontal slash, using the momentum to inflict damage. Most aim at the abdomen but some aim for the neck. An easily dodged attack.Soudai Jinkun (Grand Ruler)The user performs a vertical slash, using the momentum to inflict damage. This technique is mostly performed from up to down. Simple attack which is as easy to dodge.Zaiaku no Kama (Sickle of Sin)Mostly used as a defensive move to stop opponents who try to close the distance, without actually doing too much harm. The user makes a slash with his scythe, using the blunt side of the it. If the weapon has no blunt side, it is pretty much a Funkei attack.		5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
923	2	2	Teachings of the Shinigami	Shinigami no Oshie	Striking Ability: A great improvement in control, the user is capable to make abrupt course changes while performing an attack. The strength of the slashes still rely on the momentum of the blow and the user still has to stay firm on the ground while attacking.Defense: Simple attacks are now no problem anymore and can be easily deflected. The user will have problems when dealing with projectile weapons, as he can only dodge the incoming projectiles.Movement: Movement only gains a slight change, as now the user is more familiar with the weapon. With more control over the scythe comes more speed. Performed attacks are a bit faster than at the previous stage.	5	4		Hisanshin (Flying Death)Using the form of the scythe, the user is capable to throw his scythe at his opponent. After one post the scythe will return to the user, making him vulnerable for the duration he has no scythe.Kurogengetsu (Black Crescent Moon)The user crouches down and slashes towards the opponents legs, followed by a powerful high swing. Not the fastest attack, but can be fatal if used right.	Special Techniques Requirement: Willpower 4, Tactics 4Tsume (Claw)The user channels chakra along the scythe's blade, invisibly lengthening it by up to 4 inches. This technique can be used alone, but is usually used as part of a more advanced technique.	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
923	3	3	Teachings of the Shinigami	Shinigami no Oshie	Striking Ability: The user finally reached the stage where he has not to rely on the momentum of the strike to make an effective attack, as he built up enough muscle strength to perform attacks, without the blows losing its force. Neither has he to stand firm on the ground to perform an attack. With the gained control, the user can spin and twirl his scythe like a bo user would.Defense: Dueling, deflecting and blocking. All of this is gained when reaching this stage of the Shinigami no Oshie by using the blade and handle to block weapons and hand-to-hand attacks alike.Movement: No longer, look the movement awkward or unsure, but reach a somewhat fluid motion. Side steps seem to come naturally to the user, granting great ease to dodge incoming blows. The user does not need to stay firm on the ground and is able to jump around half or a bit more of his own height. The strikes gained another boost in speed, giving them a more dangerous property.	5	4		Hakahori (Gravedigger)Leaping towards the opponent, the user performs a vertically slash down at the opponent. Due to the long reach of the scythe, the user does not need to get too close to the opponent.Hekikyouran (Barrier Frenzy)The user spins and twirls his scythe like staff user love doing it. With the spinning the user can use this technique both offensive and defensive. If the opponent is close-by, this technique can be used to force him to move away from the user, giving him back the preferred distance battle style. Defensive the user can block incoming projectiles (kunai, senbon, etc.) as long as he has a good view of them and is not distracted.	Special Techniques Requirement: Willpower 7, Tactics 7, Intelligence 6Shinigami no Metsuki (Eyes of the Shinigami)The opponent will feel the sudden notion that he is about to die, triggering a vision of his own death in the most gruesome and painful way possible. It makes the victim halt, debating if he should flee from battle and save his life. The technique can only be initiated if the user makes eye contact with the target. A target with a higher willpower than the user will not be affected by this technique.	10	10	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
923	4	4	Teachings of the Shinigami	Shinigami no Oshie	Striking Ability: The user's control over the scythe increases only slightly, granting better handling of the weapon, with more precise strikes and slashes to keep the opponent away. Wounds at this stage will go deep into the flesh and can easily cut off body parts.Defense: Defense reaches an interesting boost, as the user now has more control over the scythe he can block incoming attacks even better than before. Incoming attacks could be blocked by the handle, giving the chance for a counter strike.Movement: Movement gains a big boost in this stage, as the user can now jump over his opponent using somersaults. Motions are quick and fluid, making good use of the new gained speed to side step and circle the user's opponent. Strikes are only a bit faster than the previous stage.	5	4		Shinigami's RageWith a little start-up, the user catapults himself at his opponent, somersaulting towards him while using the scythe to attack circular (the scythe strikes vertical). With the added momentum of the somersault, the force behind this blow is fierce and painfully to block. The best way to to defend against it is dodging.	Special Techniques Requirement: Willpower 10, Tactics 10, Intelligence 8Shin no Kaze (Wind of Death)Charging the scythe with chakra, the user slashes diagonally at the wished direction. The wind produced by this attack, will be empowered by chakra and fly straight ahead cutting anything in its path. The downside is, that due to the high chakra charge, the wind gets a black tinted ripple, warning the opponent. Wounds earned by this jutsu are as if the opponent got hit by the scythe, without the property to cut through the target. The user has to wait 2 posts until using this technique again.	16	15	12	0	14	0	0	0	0
923	5	5	Teachings of the Shinigami	Shinigami no Oshie	Striking Ability: With the help of more spins and big sweeping attacks, the striking ability gives a considerable boost in power. Careless opponents will soon find themselves in a world of pain, as the user can easily cut them into pieces.Defense: There is no real change to the previous stage. The user still is capable to perform blocking, deflecting and counter moves.Movement: This stage gives the user better movement, used for the circling tactic of the style. The main boost in power is the striking speed. Slashes are quick, giving the user a slight edge to his attacks, as the opponent will have a harder time avoiding them.	5	4		Marui Meiun (Circular Doom)Slamming the scythe into the abdomen, the user will lift the target up and spin around his own axis, swinging the opponent around before slamming him on the ground.For training uses, the user can perform the same attack with shielding chakra around the blade, making the scythe's blade blunt.	Special Techniques Requirement: Willpower 15, Tactics 15, Intelligence 13Shin no Sakebi (Scream of Death)Requirements: Shin no Kaze (Wind of Death)The powered version of Shin no Kaze. Channeling chakra into the scythe, the blade will be surrounded by a black glow. Performing a swing attack in the desired direction, the force of the slash will create a surge of wind. The chakra empowered wind will charge at the wanted direction, cutting through everything in its path. Again, due to the chakra charge, the surge of wind has creates a black tinted ripple in the fireline. Kaze no Shin is capable to slice anything in its path into half and cannot be blocked. Because of that, the target has to move out of the way. The user has to wait 2 posts until using this technique again.	21	19	16	0	16	0	0	0	0
923	6	6	Teachings of the Shinigami	Shinigami no Oshie	Striking Ability: At this stage is no real change, the user only gains more dexterity to perform more complex slashes.Defense: There is only a slight amplification of the defensive capabilities. Blocks of any sort become a lot easier.Movement: Dodging at this stage gets a big enhancement. Lower level opponents will find it hard to anticipate the user's attacks, aggravating the ability to counter attack.	5	4		Shinigami's AdmonitionThe user will try to sweep the target's legs away, using the part of the handle which is near the beginning of the scythe's blade. Then he will proceed to knock the target off his feet and spin the scythe once, slamming the bottom of the handle into the opponent's stomach.	Special Techniques Requirement: Willpower 19, Tactics 19, Intelligence 18Tenkawakemeken (Fateful Circle)Requirements: Shin no Sakebi (Scream of Death)Making a circular attack, the user is able to send a surge of chakra filled wind around himself, slicing anything, caught in its path, horizontally in half. However, the surge only travels for a radius of 10 meters. Similar to Shin no Kaze, the air ripples around the wind surge. The attack is unblockable, forcing the opponent to either crouch beneath the shockwave or to jump over it, to escape this effect. The user has to wait 2 posts until using this technique again.Sesshougai (Killing Scythe)Requirements: Tsume (Claw)Using the principle of the Claw technique, the user sharpens the blade of the scythe to a point it is capable to cut through any known material. This technique is highly draining on both concentration and chakra, however, so can only be maintained for 4 posts. Due to the high chakra consummation, Sesshougai can only be used twice a battle with 4 posts in-between.	32	25	18	0	20	16	0	0	0
923	7	7	Teachings of the Shinigami	Shinigami no Oshie	Striking Ability: People reaching this stage earn the privilege to call themselves Shinigami, like the legendary God of Death who uses the scythe as his weapon. The control of this stage is legendary, with the user having earned complete control over the scythe, granting swift attacks with enough force to cut opponents into half or slice stone/wood into two.Defense: Defense reaches near perfection at this stage, as the user can take full advantage of the weapons range. Users are able to block and deflect with ease, go into duel with opponents and perform counters.Movement: Movement has reached its final stage, granting the user perfect fluid motions to use for side stepping and out maneuvering the opponent. It almost looks like the user is hovering. High jumps can be used to give more speed to the strikes, giving even more deadliness to the user's strikes.	5	4			Special Techniques Requirement: Willpower 26, Tactics 25, Intelligence 24Saishuu Sabaki (Final Judgement)Requirements: All Special TechniquesCreating the illusion of turning into the Shinigami, the God of Death, the user drives maddening fear into the opponent, making him unsure to fight. The user, still in disguise as Shinigami, will dash at the opponent while charging his scythe with enormous amounts of chakra. Once he reaches his target, the user will slash at his opponent with the scythe being charged with even stronger chakra than the Killing Scythe technique. The scythe will cut deep into the flesh of the target, bringing a great likelihood (90%) of immediate unconsciousness. Those who can withstand the power of the blow, and do not lose conscious by sheer blood lose, will find out that the attack disturbed their spiritual energy and there-by sealed his chakra away, for the duration of 2 posts.But the most feared aspect of this power, is that the user is not called Shinigami for nothing. Using the scythe as medium for their demonic chakra, the user is able to attack specific points on the target's body, killing him without leaving any trace. This gives the illusion that the user stole the target's soul.((Instant death needs the approval of the target, of course.))The user is not unaffected by the enormous amount of chakra he has to feed to his scythe, and the concentration he needs to keep up the illusion of being the Shinigami. This technique not only seals the target's chakra, but it also renders the user unable to use chakra-consuming moves for 2 posts due. The illusion of the Shinigami stays in place for 3 posts, even while attacking.	40	36	23	0	24	20	0	0	0
922	1	1	Spinning Green Turtle	Aoi Kame Bouseki	Chain Maneuvering: It's nothing special at this point, it's even clumsy but in this stage, the practitioner's focus is trying to keep the blades away from himself while he fight and he could manage to do that provided that nothing affects his maneuvers.Speed: Slow, predictable and easy to perceive.Defense: The user is still to clumsy to use his weapon for defense.	5	2	2			5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
922	2	2	Spinning Green Turtle	Aoi Kame Bouseki	Chain Maneuvering: At this stage the user can focus more about his own fight rather than trying to keep the blades away from his body. With this stage achieved, it's safe to say that the practitioner of the style won't hurt himself with his weapon.Speed: The chains are starting to pick up pace, they move at higher Speeds now but are still not moving at dangerous Speeds.Defense: Defense training has just started for the user. At this stage, only the most basic attacks can be parried or blocked and even when that is done, it provides little protection.	5	2	2	SweepEver wanted to sweep someone off their feet? To use this technique, the tip holding position is recommended for greater range. Then, the other tip of the weapon is swung horizontally at the target's feet.		9	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0
922	3	3	Spinning Green Turtle	Aoi Kame Bouseki	Chain Maneuvering: You no longer worry while handling your weapon. By now, you're quite accustomed to it, you can move around and maneuvering your chains without being hindered much.Speed: The weapon's Speed is starting to become potentially lethal especially if blades are present.Defense: By using accuracy and precise timing, the user can pick off projectiles in mid-air using his chains or blades.	5	2	2	StrangleThis is a very simple technique that requires quick execution or an unsuspecting target. The user throws his chains over the target's neck and pulls each tip of the chain to a different direction. If blades are present, waiting for the target to run out of breath is not necessary as finishing him off with one of the blades would be a simple task when he's caught.		13	0	17	0	8	0	0	0	0
922	4	4	Spinning Green Turtle	Aoi Kame Bouseki	Chain Maneuvering: Chains have been toyed with for a long time now. You can now move at a constant rate while keeping your chains at constant movement to and maintaining their rhythm.Speed: The spinning weapon has become much harder to perceive with your current Strength and naturally, more lethal.Defense: Defense is also starting to come out naturally. By now, you can deflect attacks and parry them while maintaining the movement rhythm.	5	2	2	Boomerang ChainsBy throwing the Chained Scythe at a specified target, it flies at great Speed due to the user's Strength and if the target is chopped or destroyed or if the attack misses, the chain flies back. This can be used to either trap or slice a target.		20	10	13	0	0	0	0	0	0
922	5	5	Spinning Green Turtle	Aoi Kame Bouseki	Chain Maneuvering: The focus in the stage is a little different. Now you can do anything those stuntmen on TV can and on addition to that, you have blades. You can attack, defend, and spin around your weapon pointlessly while maintaining the spinning movement. You can also move at full Speed without hindering your weapon usage.Speed: The untrained eyes have no hope of following the chain's movements as is it simply too fast to be followed by a pathetic set of eyes.Defense: Deflecting and parrying can be done similarly to the previous stage but at a faster pace.	5	2	2			25	14	17	0	16	0	0	0	0
922	6	6	Spinning Green Turtle	Aoi Kame Bouseki	Chain Maneuvering: Unlike the previous stage where you can show off for one second and fight for another, now you can perform battle stunts such as spinning the weapon around your body and flipping it over to parry an attack in mid stunt and you would keep going for the next stunt naturally.Speed: It's a struggle to keep up with the chain's movements now, even for trained eyes.Defense: ((look at Chain maneuvering for this stage))	5	2	2			20	22	24	0	20	16	0	0	0
922	7	7	Spinning Green Turtle	Aoi Kame Bouseki	Chain Maneuvering: Mastery has been achieved. There's nothing else you can improve in your technique. Your weapon moves naturally wherever you want it to; you make it seem so easy it seems as if the weapon moves on its own. You can do whatever you want and never be concerned about hurting anything but your target.Speed: A tad bit faster than the previous stage.Defense: ((Same as previous stage))	5	2	2			35	32	32	0	25	19	0	0	0
921	1	1	Sickle and Chain Style Heaven and Hell	Kusarigamaryuu Tendou Jigoku	Acrobatics - Nothing fancy here at all to be completely honest. The user will be forced to train up his sense of balance, walking while spinning the chain without losing any momentum.Chain of heaven - The user must learn to know how much of the chain he must release to hit is foe and keep it at that. He has yet acquired the skill to shoot it toward his foe so at most he can use it as long-ranged flail.Sickle of hell - Practically nothing is taught in the use of the sickle at this stage. You can always just try to cut someone with it, but it would be dodged easily.	5	4		SmashAlso know as 'trying to hit that other guy in the head with the weight. Releasing a length of the chain, the user spin and strikes out with it like a flail.		4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
921	2	2	Sickle and Chain Style Heaven and Hell	Kusarigamaryuu Tendou Jigoku	Acrobatics - Once again these are still at a very basic level. He has yet to completely master what he has learned at the first stage and must train to improve those.Chain of heaven - It is at this stage that you can actually use the 'chain launch'. Your feet must however be completely planted to the ground and the weight will travel in a completely linear path.Sickle of hell - What is taught at this stage is mostly common defensive movements when facing an armed opponent. It is still not advisable to go into melee with it though.	5	4		GrappleThe user throws the weight toward the opponent with the purpose of having the chain wrap itself around the target. This could be the leg of the foe in order to send him/her off balance.		7	7	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
921	3	3	Sickle and Chain Style Heaven and Hell	Kusarigamaryuu Tendou Jigoku	Acrobatics - A flexible body as well as the balance are the keys here. By being able to sway backward and weave the body, the user can avoid the attacks and take a safe distance once more.Chain of heaven - You have by now acquired the necessary balance to be able to move around without losing the momentum of the spin. The chain can be thrown while moving but will still travel in a rather linear path.Sickle of hell - When parrying attacks with the sickle and the chain, you can either parry it with the sickle or with the chain by grabbing a hold of two parts of it.	5	4		DisarmA technique used against armed opponents. Launching the weight at their foe's sword for example, the chain will wrap itself around it. In that same motion the user will tug the chain back, hopefully disarming them before they will realize the danger with the chain interlocked with their weapon.False disarmOne could say this is another option instead of disarming the foe. If the opponent struggles against it, the user will hold it for a moment before letting go of it, hopefully sending the opponent open as well as slightly off balance. They will literally jump as close to them as possible and ram the sickle in their back.		11	9	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
921	4	4	Sickle and Chain Style Heaven and Hell	Kusarigamaryuu Tendou Jigoku	Acrobatics - At this stage you could say that you take the first step toward a more offensive use of the sickle. Quick dashes combined with your by now great agility will increase your chances of getting within range of the opponent unharmed.Chain of heaven - By now the thrown chain can now be thrown in a curving path. This will increase the chances of hitting your enemy.Sickle of hell - The weighted end is not the only part that can be thrown. At this level you can do so; however it is a risky move as it will leave you unable to attack up close effectively.	5	4		Heavenly ProtectionThe user spins the chain in front of him and uses it to deflect incoming projectile attacks.Knuckle breakerThis specific technique is a weight thrown so that it will travel along the ground and the curve upward, hitting the opponent in the knuckles or the wrist with the intent of breaking them. Due to the path it will travel will make it an attack which is hard to notice.GrasscutterA technique which combines element of the Smash and the new option of a curving throw. It is the sickle that is thrown and will travel in a horizontal motion with the intent that the blade will reach and cut the opponents calf, effectively hindering their movement.Chain Feint (aka Shooting Blanks)The user will throw the chain but will retract it within a meter, spin it once more before releasing it again. While this may sound simple it requires a tremendous strength. This makes it possible to stop the shot and adjust it to a new target, or used as a feint.	AnchorWith precise chakra control the user may change the direction of the chain. For every five points of control the user may shift the direction of the attack. This ability makes it not only harder to dodge the chain; it will be able to strike with a much higher accuracy.	18	15	10	0	14	0	0	0	0
921	5	5	Sickle and Chain Style Heaven and Hell	Kusarigamaryuu Tendou Jigoku	Acrobatics - This is where actual acrobatics will be introduced. The user will now use their nimbleness in order to get behind the opponent and strike from a weak spot.Chain of heaven - The user can throw the chain in the middle of a somersault without losing any of the momentum or a decrease in accuracy.Sickle of hell - You will now learn to use it more offensively without necessarily leaving yourself open for opposing counterattacks. Grabbing hold of the chain in the middle you will be unable to launch the chain, but will become a whirling storm of weights and blades.	5	4		Heaven's decreeAn advanced version of the Smash. The user throws the weight up into the air above him as high as he can, then with a quick lashing motion sends the weight and the chain crashing down on the opponent. The collected force in this attack is almost enough to create a crack in the ground where the weight and the chain lands.Dance of the HurricaneGrabbing a hold of the middle of the chain the user will spin around while also spinning both ends. There is not set pattern that the user will follow but move in a wild dance while crashing skulls and swinging the sickle of death spinning past his opponent. In short it is a combo attack with both ends in one post with the hope that one of them will land.Necktie partyFirst the user will block an attack or attack their opponent in order to keep their attention to the sickle. The user will then use their free hand to snare the chain around the foe's neck, slip past their guard, putting a knee on their back and attempt to strangle the foe.		26	20	10	0	16	0	0	0	0
921	6	6	Sickle and Chain Style Heaven and Hell	Kusarigamaryuu Tendou Jigoku	Acrobatics - More or less improvement of stage five.Chain of heaven - The user has improved on how quickly he can build up the necessary momentum, enabling him to throw the chain even if the enemy is really close. Plus this stage it is not impossible for them to throw both ends at the same time or one after the other (ie a chain throw followed by grasscutter)Sickle of hell - Improvement on stage five	5	4		Eye of the stormAn attack that falls into the same category as 'Dance of the Hurricane. The user spins both ends and releases both of them at the same time. These will fly toward the opponent where they will catch and encircle him, causing damage not only by the weight but by the sickle that will certainly embed itself in his flesh. As this leave the user completely defenceless it is not something that should be used carelessly.Chain Feint II (aka Shooting Blanks II)Like the similar technique except that the user can now stop it after it has travelled one meter. It can also be stopped a second time after finally being launched a third.		29	26	20	0	18	18	0	0	0
921	7	7	Sickle and Chain Style Heaven and Hell	Kusarigamaryuu Tendou Jigoku	The user has now reached the peak of skill with the kusarigama and can be fittingly only be referred to as a 'natural disaster'. Walls and building turns to rubble when hit by it and forests are cut down by the sickle of hell. Their movement are but nigh impossible to read neither is there a single hole in their offence or defence as they move in a fleet footed manner and rain death upon their enemies. They are the living incarnations of both heaven and hell, destruction following in their wake.	5	4		Chain Feint III (aka Shooting Blanks III)They can now stop the chain once after it has travelled up to one meter, once after it has travelled up to one and a half meter and once after its travelled two meters.		37	34	28	0	22	22	0	0	0
920	1	1	Heavenly Claw	Tenrai Tsume	Striking: At this level the user is barely able to run with the weapon, much less fight with it. Right now, the most the practioneer can do is shift their weight onto one foot and then bring the giant claw downwards. Of course, this will do damage if they get a clear shot.Chain Ability: N/AEvasion: Like said before, the user can barely attack with the weapon. At this stage, the ninja practices more on evading then attacking. The user is able to dodge inept thrown projectiles.	3	4	2		Kusari bunshin (Chain clone)(*Needed for all special techs)Description: The user forms a bunshin out of their weapons (preferably kunai or shuriken). When summoned, the clone looks identical to the user in every way. This bunshin is used later on in the style. It is capable of being attacked as well as attacking. The clone's stats are 1/10 of the user's original . One clone can be created for every 4 Willpower ,10 clones can be created.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
920	2	2	Heavenly Claw	Tenrai Tsume	Striking: The user is now able to fight decent enough with the weapon to be called a practioneer of the style. At this point though, the user tries to combine their evasiveness with their speed in able to get an opening on their opponent, then strike.Chain Ability: A newly possessed skill. The user is able to shoot out their hidden chain by applying chakra to the gears. The chain can travel a distance of 7 feet right now and takes one post to rewind.Evasion: The user's ability to evade attacks has changed slightly. While their do better in dodging projected weapons, they are also able to dodge close range attacks with difficulty, mainly because they have to carry around the large glove.	3	4	2			7	7	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
920	3	3	Heavenly Claw	Tenrai Tsume	Striking: The user's ability to strike with the glove has increased tremendously. They are now used to the extra weight, and can make clear shots easily.Chain Ability: At this level the user can now fire the chain to a distance of 13 feet. But, because it still takes one post to rewind the chain, the user prefers to use the chain as either a finishing move.Evasion: Now more adapt at dodging close range attacks, as well as being able to dodge projectiles more easily.	3	4	2		Hensei: Binshou Kison (Formation: Quick Assassination)Description: The user summons one chain bunshin. Upon created, the clone's chain and the user's chain are linked together and visible. The next part of the attack is the clone and user circle the enemy, and wrap him in the chains. Then, they pull their Gurabu Tsume's in the opposite direction, thus shredding the target.	10	10	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
920	4	4	Heavenly Claw	Tenrai Tsume	Striking: The user's ability to strike the target is incredible. Not only is the strike an almost guaranteed gash or worse, as well as their countering ability is hard to comprehend.Chain Ability: The user can now rely on their ability with the chain enough to use it more often. They can now shoot the chain to a distance of 15 feet and can rewind the chain in the same post it is shot.Evasion: Still viewable to the human eye. What a lame title. Unfortunately this is what the user is. Now focusing on make a long dash instead of trying to dodge each projectile, and to side step whenever close range fighting.	3	4	2		Hensei: Hanasu Ken Fuubi (Formation: Divide and Conquer)Description: A rather bold formation. This technique requires two bunshin, no more, no less. When the clones are created, one will be standing left of the user and another to the right. The three attackers will charge at the enemy and then split three ways. The user (who is charging in the middle) will leap and slash at the target's head. The other two clones will strife to the left/right and then fire their chains at the target, either impaling him/her or holding them down. The end result (if worked correctly) is a headless/ impaled and headless target.	14	16	13	0	14	0	0	0	0
920	5	5	Heavenly Claw	Tenrai Tsume	Striking: A breakthrough with strength, they have gained enough of it to snap a katana or pole in half if they can get their claw on it.Chain Ability: No ChangeEvasion: The user now looks like a blur to the target. Projectiles are dodged based on instinct, and close ranged fighting is becoming better.	3	4	2		Hensei: Kagai no bunshin (Formation: Assault of the clones)Description: This technique takes a step up on clone creation. Four clones are required for this technique.Unlike the other techniques, this one can only be used in the middle of battle. The user runs at the target, and then forms four chain bunshin in what would look like an arrow formation. The clones and the user split up so they surround the target four ways around. From here, the fighters' run around the target, confusing his/her sense, of which is which. Every few seconds, a clone will jump out of the running circle and slash at the target, then retreat back to the circle. Repeat.	18	20	17	0	16	0	0	0	0
920	6	6	Heavenly Claw	Tenrai Tsume	Striking: Every strike and hit feels like a brick smashing into the target flying at 10 mph, as well leaving a nasty mark. The user can now use the claw as if it were an appendage, the weight difference no longer causes even the slightest problem.Chain Ability: No ChangeEvasion: Finally, the user is able to evade almost any kind of attack. Projectiles still remain useless against the target, and now close range weapons pose no threat.	3	4	2		Mattaki Kusari Bunshin (Perfect Chain Clone)Description: An improved chain bunshin. This clone's only difference is it will not disperse when struck. The bunshin's stats are half of the user's physical/mental/chakra stats plus five to each category. Also, the clone has knowledge of up to stage three of the Tenrai Tsume style. One clone can be created. Can only be destroyed if the user runs out of chakra or dismisses it	23	30	22	0	20	16	0	0	0
920	7	7	Heavenly Claw	Tenrai Tsume	Striking: Finally at the seventh stage. The user has enough experience with the weapon that it takes no more then a few hits to bring some of the hardest opponents to their knees.Chain Ability: The user's ability to shoot the chain has increased to a range of twenty feet and can be rewound the same post fired.Evasion: The user may still be seen to the human eye, but the image of him is hard to comprehend. At this stage, the user is seen as a blur of colors and after images if going at full speed, leaving any weapon thrown at them rendered useless.	3	4	2		Hensei: Bunshin Finaru (Formation: Clone Finale)Description: Truly an attack to be afraid of. The user by now can make at least five chain bunshin. Any more will be fine.The attack starts out where the user is about to strike the opponent. Whether it's an ambush or running into battle, they are ready. Upon heading into the fray, the user creates a number of clones (5+). Each clone will rush at the enemy and prepare to go one on one. Of course, they never will because it's about five clones or more all-together fighting one enemy. The user will wait in the distance and make an attempt to fire the chain at the enemy. After what seems like a minute, the remaining clones (that weren't destroyed) will attack the target with any weapon they have left. This includes the chain, claws or just feet and legs.	32	38	29	0	26	18	0	0	0
919	1	1	Wire-Puller's Ritual	Higi no Kagemusha	Limit: Right now the limit is 2 - one per hand - nothing special or fancy about it. Each wire is attached to the index finger. Wire attack range is 3 feet.Control: Control at this stage is clumsy and totally incapable of anything flashy. The user is nominally restricted to simple lashing motions at a single target. Overall the user is getting used to the wires.Durability: Again the user is just starting out with the wires and hasn't even begun to try and increase their durability. For all intents and purposes they are just wires and can be cut as such with no restrictions.Cutting: It's normal razor wire. Lashes can inflict minor cuts to the skin, but the cuts are superficial at best. Sturdier surfaces like wood and thicker clothing (flak jackets, leather coats, etc) resist the wires quite well, though softer materials like cotton can be shaved through easily.Speed: Speed isn't the issue here. The wires themselves are so slow and unwieldy at this stage they can be seen clearly flying though the air. Most people would just get out of the way or slice the wires making surprise attacks the only option at this stage.	2	5	2	LashThe lash is basically a whipping motion that slashes a wire across the surface of something and attempts to cut it. It's almost like slashing a sword although markedly harder to do.		0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
919	2	2	Wire-Puller's Ritual	Higi no Kagemusha	Limit: Four wires now - two per hand - and an attack range of 6 feet. The extra wire is attached to the thumb.Control: At stage 2 the user is much more settled into the role of the Kagemusha and is a lot more familiar with the wires. Now capable of sending different hands in different attacks, the user also learns how to wrap their wires around a specific target - although the user's full concentration and both hands are need to do this.Durability: Finally realizing the inherent weaknesses in the wires, the user learns to strike with two wires acting in unison. Seen as his control is limited to each hand why not use the extra wires to supports each other? This naturally makes them harder to cut, but still nothing special.Cutting: Improving upon the practices of the last level, the wires can now create slice marks in materials it previously could not. Lash wounds are somewhat deeper, but still not enough to cause significant injuries. Wrapping lengths of wire around a target and pulling back - creating a saw effect through the drag - is the most potent form of damage at this stage.Speed: The wires are much faster now and the user begins to cut out the unnecessary movements in each attack. A slight whip like motion has begun to appear, but this is still nothing special.	2	5	2	Wrap and SawThis attack first wraps around something and then drags directly across or backwards and forwards across the wrapped object. This dramatically increases the damage done and improves the cutting power, but it takes one post to actually wrap something up before you can start to slice it.		0	9	5	0	0	6	0	0	0
919	3	3	Wire-Puller's Ritual	Higi no Kagemusha	Limit: Ah the beauty of six wires, the stage attaches an extra wire to each of the user's middle fingers and grants an attack range of 9 feet.Control: Learn quickly does the student. The user may strike at 3 different locations by using the thumb and index finger on each hand and the middle fingers in unison. The user may also 'bat' projectiles away by sweeping a hand across the flying objects. Also the user may now wrap around two different targets as they learn how to user their mouth as a point of leverage.Durability: the user still relies on a tandem of wires to provide basic strength, but now a certain amount of slack can be seen in each attack. These wires bend more easily under pressure and can absorb some of the force of an edged weapon. Whichever wire pair the enemy attack attempted to cut is essentially 'dodged' (the attack loses its force and cause no damage) but the wires themselves aren't necessarily rendered permanently useless. Skilled enemies may try an attack to cut the wires, but it must be a sizeable attack (no just flinging a sword around).Cutting: Having mastered the basics, thin woods (pencils, calligraphy brushes, plywood) can be lashed through with the work of several strikes. Wrapping and sawing can take care of plastic materials, and furthermore now have the power to bite firmly into the bark of a tree..Speed: The wire's speed is starting to come into its own now and most unnecessary movements have been eliminated completely. This enhanced form and the user's own growing speed make this level quite an accomplishment.	2	5	2	Wrap and HoldWorking on the same principal as wrap and saw - the warp and hold technique is specifically designed to restrain a target without hurting them too badly. Unfortunately, this move is highly unrealistic until a user gain the anchor technique.	BurstThe burst is a highly specialized speed enhancer. With precise chakra control the user may boost their land speed for a few precious seconds. This move may be used twice per thread with a one post cool down. The move itself increases the user's speed - not their wire speed - by 30% of their speed. A 30% stat deduction is applied to strength for two posts after Burst is used. This boost only lasts 1 post. You may postpone the deduction by Bursting a second time, but the percentage doubles for 4 posts. This effect cannot be stacked with gates.	0	11	9	0	0	8	0	0	0
919	4	4	Wire-Puller's Ritual	Higi no Kagemusha	Limit: The magic eight; at this stage the user has every finger but his pinky armed with a wire - almost at the top now. You now have an attack range of 12 feet.Control: The user has become much more fluid in his movements. The main digits (index and thumb) are now capable of acting on their own - raising the number of attacks to six different locations. Or by still using pairs the user is capable of wrapping up to four different locations by using a complex lever system where the wires give each other the pull strength along with the hands and mouth. Chakra is becoming a much more important factor in the user's skill and it is not uncommon for people at this stage in the tree to be able to stop a wire midair with the proper training.Durability: Because of the increased control and the users actual skill to use single wires independently the technique of striking in pairs to act as a buffer no longer works. Instead an increased focus on wire slack takes its place. This alone would only keep the wires at the same level of protection however, so the newly acquired ability to transmit chakra through the wires as been added to increase it's overall toughness. Note that the two remaining attacks that still use double wires do not receive any extra protection - these fingers are too unskilled to provide the same level of slack control and so are at the same level as the rest of the wires.Cutting: Lashes are now almost on par - in truth, less powerful - than sword strikes of those equal in training in Kenjutsu to the Kagemusha with his wires. Lash wounds resemble those most like slash wounds from kunai, though the number of wires makes up for this lack of power. The wire can dig and bury into wood when lashed, and can (with several posts' work) saw through the trunk of a tree, given enough effort. Softer, more porous stone can be marked by the wires, but are still unable to be really damaged; harder rocks and metals are still untouchable.Speed: Finally mastering the whipping motion of the wires, speed again increases. Mostly due to their lack of size, the wires are now beginning to become hard to see, and enemies that lack the speed or the reflexes to keep up with the wires will find themselves with a very short lifespan indeed.	2	5	2	PierceAt this stage the user can 'flick' his/her wires to go through go through most substances. This doesn't actually do any damage - the wires being so small and all - but it does have the effect of negating whatever cover a target maybe hiding behind. In all other respects this acts much like a lash attack.	AnchorWith precise chakra control the user may change the direction of their wires. For every five points of control the user may shift the direction of their attacks once per wire. This ability increases the tactical applications of the wire several fold and even allows the user to restrain a target.	10	18	15	0	0	14	0	0	0
919	5	5	Wire-Puller's Ritual	Higi no Kagemusha	Limit: Unless you've got extra fingers - and don't get any ideas about that - this is the limit - an almighty ten wires can now be used at a single time along with a massive attack radius of 15 feet.Control: This aspect is nearly mastered now. A total of eight different lash type attacks can be used at this level - or thanks to heavy duty training - six different wraps can be performed and mundanely thrown projectiles can now be snatched out of the air.Durability: Chakra reinforcement hasn't improved at all in this stage, as full attention has been turned to slack. The natural tendencies of the wire coupled with the advanced training provided by this stage allow the user to capture an opponent's weapon when they try to strike the wires. This tangles up what ever tried to cut the wire and renders it useless until the Kagemusha drops it or the enemy spends a post getting back his weapon by snapping whatever wires were holding it. The capture itself requires the Kagemusha's attention to pull off, so it cannot be done if focus is concentrated elsewhere.Cutting: The potency of lashes has not improved much over the previous stage, but now it becomes clear the best way to dish out damage with wires is through the wrapping and sawing method - especially if the wire is wrapped around the target multiple times. The trunks of fully grown oak trees can be sawed away in two posts of continuous wrap/saw, and now even stone can now be bit into when sawing.Speed: Only those with exceptional training could hope to keep up at this level. The wires are beginning to blur past human vision and as you can imagine that makes them very hard to dodge and without the reflexes or the luck to get out of a situation like that you're just a dead man walking.	2	5	2	Lash and SawThe user's skill is evident and the dangers their weapons present are obvious. With this technique the user may completely ignore the preparation post for receiving the wrap bonus and will no longer have to apply the penalty with this technique. This is achieved through careful control and an intimate knowledge of the wires' properties and tendencies to continue acting even when you try and pull them in a different direction. Send the wires around something and while they're doing that set them to pull straight back in one easy motion.	RodA technique implored by Kagemusha when slightly less finesse is required. First, the Kagemusha flexes their fingers to straighten out the wires. The, combined with a quick twist of the wrist and a small pulse of chakra, the wires spin around and essentially braid themselves into one, long "rod." The braided is not wound extremely tight so as to multiply force of blunt blows like bamboo kendo swords. Blows from the braid are heavier than the wires alone and have been known to break bones on occasion. But, the braid is slower in attack speed due to its increased size and weight. Special techniques have been developed in conjunction with this ability, including being able to unravel the braid in certain lengths of the rod for strategic purposes. The rod is less dexterous than the individual wires and therefor cannot be combined with Anchor.	16	22	18	0	0	16	0	0	0
919	6	6	Wire-Puller's Ritual	Higi no Kagemusha	Limit: At this stage, the wire limit hasn't changed - the user has just run out of fingers to tie wire around! Even if someone managed to get extra digits their brain just couldn't handle so many wires so fast. However, the increased mastery of the style has given the Kagemusha an attack range of 18 feet.Control: At long last the style has reached the zenith of control. All wires have now gained enough independence to be able to execute ten wrap attack equivalents. The control at this stage is so great that the wires are beginning to function more like limbs than weapons - and indeed the amount of chakra running though them give this quality.Durability: No level of extra slack could be applied even if the user wanted to. So instead, they compensate by running more chakra through the wires to increase the resilience even further. Again only a weapon master with a boat load of training could even attempt to cut these wires - and even then they would risk getting their weapon tangled.Cutting: Lashing takes its final boost in strength, as now it is fully comparable to a moderate sword wound, at best. Again, although circumstances rarely allow for the perfect lash for maximum damage, the Kagemusha's advantage is in his superior number of wires over a regular swordsman's one sword. The main focus of lashing is no longer to primarily defeat the opponent, but rather wear him down with numerous minor injuries, or keep him at a safe distance. Wrapping and sawing can now grate against softer metals, creating sparks and saw marks; higher grade materials forged for Shinobi purposes such as kunai and shuriken, though, remain unaffected.Speed: The speed of these wires are now almost at their pinnicle. Tehy don't get much faster than this. Tracking them is only possible through the use of a basic dojutsu, those with a heightened ability to track movement, or those taijutsu masters who are accustomed to fighting at such speed. I'm afraid everyone else is out of luck. Some unskilled people have remarked a master's ability to merely flick his hand and destroy entire structures without even touching them - their eyes merely unable to see the wires in motion.	2	5	2	Pierce and SawThis technique combines the best elements of this style into a single, efficient package. Cover means nothing anymore as careful use of the pierce technique combined with the anchor move has resulted in skill that can do both. The user may now apply their wrap bonus without the one turn restriction while using the pierce technique.	SphereThe Kagemusha forms extra charka into their wires and the proceeds to move in quick precise patterns. What looks like flailing around is actually the user moving their wires at extremely high speeds. Their movement forces the wires to cover every point in a spherical radius around the user in an exceptionally small amount of time. This sphere of death is tough enough to block all ninjutsu attacks of stage 5 and lower. Any taijutsu attacks of stage 1-4 requiring hand-to-hand contact will result in the attacker being badly injured as well as the attack being blocked. Attacks with a stage 5 tai are simply blocked and no harm is done to the attacker. They essentially cancel each other out. Any tai attacks from stages 6 and 7 are not blocked, however, if they require bodily contact, the attacker will be injured by the spinning wires. The Kagemusha may use this skill as long as their Control divided by 4.	20	30	25	17	0	19	0	0	0
919	7	7	Wire-Puller's Ritual	Higi no Kagemusha	Limit: No change in the number of wires but the attack range has become 21 feet, the pinnacle of wire combat mastery.Control: Ten independent wires can perform any number of different attacks simultaneously. Excessive movement on the user's part is practically eliminated, so much so that they appear more like a conductor of a symphony than a warrior in battle; a symphony of destruction, that is.Durability: The wires are now nearly unbreakable due to the user's mastery of their wire control; it would take someone of equal skill with an edged weapon to sever them, or an extremely potent jutsu. Trying to sever them would practically be suicide if you failed to consider the rest of the attacks.Cutting: With lashing already at its peak, all that's left for the Kagemusha to master is the sawing aspect. Flesh no longer stands a chance against the merciless wires; while larger limbs such as arms and legs would not be immediately severed (though they would sustain harsh injuries if wrapped/sawed; only continuous sawing would eventually tear them off), smaller appendages like fingers and ears would be lopped off in one go. The metals that could not be marred before can now at least be scratched and gouged (but no more than a regular sword) by the sawing potential of the Kagemusha.Speed: The speed of the wires have not increased much from stage 6. The wire's speed coupled with the degree of control the Kagemusha possess make the wires even harder to track.	2	5	2		UnionAt this stage the user is so familiar with themselves and their wires they literally become a part of their body. The wires are now fully capable of acting without any physical movement on the user's part. The anchor's per attack clause is also negated and the wires become free to bend and twist in every which way at once. Only someone who sees a master and lives can attest to the utter lethality of this style.	24	40	35	20	0	24	0	0	0
918	1	1	River Willow	Senryu	Fan Control: At this stage, the Senryu-ka only gets used to the handling of the fan, as it can be used to perform two kind of main attacks: Stabs, when the fan is closed and slashes, when opened. Because of this, attacks and the process between open and folded look awkward and unsure. While learning to control the style, students prefer to keep it either open or closed until they have better control. Attacks are performed in simple motions. Movements: Only starting with how to perfectly walk the circle, movement is awkward at this stage, lacking the fluid movements and beauty this style is known for. Jumping is mostly used for defensive purposes, to launch the Senryu-ka out of harms way or dodge ground attacks. Defense: While lacking the fluid motion of higher levels, the user can easily dodge by circling out of an attacks way, changing suddenly direction. Regular Techniques:	3	4	2	Kiritsukeru (Slash) The most basic attack either performed vertically or horizontally, with the fan opened. Shishou (Stabbing) Another basic attack where the user stabs at the opponent with the closed fan at any part of the opponent's body. Stomach or face are the prefered target here. Koukuukougeki (Air Strike) With the fan opened, the Senryu-ka slashes diagonally upwards at the opponent. A very basic move and easy to dodge.	Nagare Tabakaru (Current Trick) * A very simple and most basic technique used by starting students of the Senryu. The user will, from a distance of maximum 30 feet away, drop and sweep at ground level as if trying to kick the opponent feet away. Suddenly, in the direction the strike was performed, a gust of wind will come and try to knock the opponent of his feet, allowing the Senryu-ka a retreat. If once hit, most opponents learn to just jump over the current. Cool-down time of 2 posts.	0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
918	2	2	River Willow	Senryu	Fan Control: The Senryu-ka gets more sure about the handling of the fan, adding some fluidity to the fan movement, the user will have an easier time to change between open and closed. The user also can switch easily between stabbing and slashing. Still, the attacks are mostly simple attacks like stabbing or slashing motions. Movements: Movement become more fluid, attacks can be performed swifter than before and the jumping height became greater. Now the Senryu-ka can easily jump to around his waist's height. Defense: Fluidity and swiftness gained at this stage, combined with some strength, grant the user to swiftly block incoming attacks and then move away to get some distance to the opponent. Another defensive technique is that the Senryu-ka hooks into an incoming attacks arm and hurls the opponent over the shoulder.	3	4	2	Tessen no Souji (Sweeping Fan) With the fan being either closed or opened, the Senryu-ka will slash at opponent's legs. This way he tries to hit the other one of his feet.	Shunkashuutou no Mai (Dance of the Four Seasons) * Pressing his hands to his body, the user will spin around his own axis, creating a two inches thick shield, made of small air currents, around his body. This will block incoming projectiles and make attackers stumble back a few feet. This spin can only be done for a short time and might leave the user dizzy. Ninjutsu attacks are only weakened by Shunkashuutou no Mai. It can only be used again after a 3 posts cool-down time.	0	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0
918	3	3	River Willow	Senryu	Fan Control: More control over the fan weapon gives the user the ability to add spinning to their movement allowing for more powerful slashing and stabbing attacks. Movements: Gone are the awkwardness and unsureness, replaced by fluid movement even more so than before. The circular maneuvers become fluid adding more complex maneuvers. Heights around the shoulder can be easily reached while jumping. Another boost in strength and speed grant the Senryu-ka to do acrobatic feats as well. Defense: Using the newly acquired acrobatic feats, combined with the more complex maneuvers can the user easily deflect attacks and even try to disarm his opponent.	3	4	2	Dageki no Bouseki (Spinning Strike) * The Senryu-ka when close to the opponent, the user will spin to either the left or right and change to a lower stance, striking at the opponent's stomach.	Bakuha no Bouseki (Spinning Blast) The Senryu-ka will assume any stance with his right leg in front and his fan opened. Taking one step with his left leg, the user will spin one time around his own axis and proceed to jump into the air around waist height, spinning another time vertically doing a cartwheel in the air. Landing on his right leg, the user will slash downwards with the fan creating a blast of wind strong enough to blow objects away. Incoming projectile weapons can be blocked and people standing in the blast's way will be thrown back at least 20 feet. Elemental jutsu of stage 2 or lower can be dispelled with this technique.	0	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0
918	4	4	River Willow	Senryu	Fan Control: Adding jumping to the spinning attacks adds even more to the power of attacks. The fan can easily be closed and opened, even during spinning and jumping, allowing for deep wounds and different kind of attack combinations. Movements: Adding even more flexibility and fluid moves to this style, the user now is capable of jumping easily at least double his normal height making it possible to jump over opponents and surprising Defense: There are no real changes here. The user can still perform blocks, deflect attacks and disarm their opponent, though everything seems to become second nature to the user adding some fluidity to it.	3	4	2	Betsudoutai (Detached Force) Opening the fan, the user can block incoming projectiles by catching them with the fan and slashing them to the ground. It is a pretty tricky move as the user needs to get the right angle to catch the projectiles without destroying their fan. Note: This move can only block small or thin projectiles, like senbon needles, kunai, shaken, shuriken, etc. No bigger projectiles, like Fuuma Shuriken, Boomerang and the like. Neither can ninjutsu projectiles be blocked.		13	16	14	0	0	14	0	0	0
918	5	5	River Willow	Senryu	Fan Control: Jumping, spinning, switching between open and closed, nothing really changes at this stage other than that wounds at this stage can be deeper than before and become easily fatal if not treated. Movements: Flexibility goes up, as does the height the user can jump, changing to double his normal height plus a half of it. Movements are more fluid than in the previous stage. Defense: With the newly gained flexibility, the user can bend out of harms way. Combining this with their circle walking the user has an even easier time blocking and dodging attacks.	3	4	2	Kaze Dageki (Breeze Strike) Using the gained speed, the user dashes at the opponent and feigns an attack at the opponent's head. However, suddenly the user will change direction, circling on his heel and slash at the opponent's feet.	Kaze no Yuuyou (Helpful Wind) * A useful defensive technique that makes it possible for the user to change the direction of an attacker. The idea came probably from watching a windmill's wheel. If the opponent comes close enough, the Senryu-ka starts to swiftly move his right hand up starting to rotate once, rotating to the left. When the right hand is above the user's head, he'll do the same with the left hand, still rotating left and after the left hand is above the head he'll start with the right again. With this movement, he is capable to lift the attacker of his feet, using an air current, carrying him over his head behind him. The Senryu-ka will repeat this movements until the attacker is back on the ground behind the user, allowing him to make an retreat.	18	20	18	0	0	16	0	0	0
918	6	6	River Willow	Senryu	Fan Control: Slashes and stabs are performed with admirable speed and the switches between open and closed make the user a power to reckon. Wounds can go deep and, when placed at the right spot, even immobilize their opponent. Movements: Jumping ability goes up to at least thrice the user's height, with nothing left but beauty behind it. Circle walking, circular movement, anything is performed with near perfection and fluidity. Defense: Performing jumps the user seems to be able to slow down in mid air, giving him a better ability to evade attacks. Deflecting and blocking incoming attacks are second nature to the Senryu-ka.	3	4	2		Amatsubakuha no Bouseki (Heavenly Spinning Blast) Requirements: Bakuha no Bouseki (Spinning Blast) Building on the same principle as the Bakuha no Bouseki, the Senryu-ka will assume any stance with his left leg in front and his fan closed. Starting with his right leg, he'll start moving in a half-circle, jumping up when reaching the other end. While being in the air, the Senryu-ka will spin diagonally with the still closed fan and open it right before landing on his feet, at the same point he started the half-circle. Continuing with another leap, he'll do a somersault, landing in the center of the half-circle, he'll slash with all the inertia gained through the spinning, creating a blast of wind which will spread in an 90 degree arch, lifting anything it hits of the ground. Hit objects and persons will then proceed to be thrown back 100 feet. Elemental jutsu of stage 5 or lower can be dispelled with this technique. This technique can only be used again after a cool-down time of 3 posts.	24	26	25	17	0	19	0	0	0
918	7	7	River Willow	Senryu	Fan Control: Fan control reached perfection in this stage. The Senryu-ka is capable of switching between slashing and stabbing in the blink of an eye, making the user a real unpredictable fighter. Slashes are performed so fast, they can easily cut through flesh and it would be no problem to cut the opponent into pieces. Movements: No longer is there anything left but beauty in the movements. Masters of this style take full advantage of the defensive maneuvers and swiftness. jumps look like the user is flying and indeed he seems to hover some inches above the ground while dancing. Defense: As if not caring about any attack, the user seems to do nothing but dance out of harm's way. Using the circular movements, the circle walking and spins the Senryu-ka can block, deflect and even redirect incoming attacks, using the opponent's force against himself.	3	4	2	Fuujin (Wind God) Through his constant taijutsu training and the speed gained at this stage, the user will dash at his opponent. When near enough, the user will perform a somersault, opening his fan and slashing with all his force towards the opponent. The strike is powerful enough to cut a tree in half.	Himai: Tenchishinmei no Mai (Secret Dance: Dance of the Heavenly and Earthly Gods) Requirements: All previous special techniques. Senryu is a very defensive style, however as time passed the masters of this style have learned that sometimes attacking is the best way to defend himself. In order to deal massive damage, without directly killing someone, the Himai: Tenchishinmei no Mai was created. The Senryu-ka will open his fan and move it around his head once while slowly spinning right. Closing it after he reached the point he started moving he'll then proceed to spin in the other direction, following to jump up at the highest height he can reach, spinning like a top around his own axis. During the whole spinning, the user constantly open and closes the fan adding circular movements to his hands. The rotation will create a tornado around the Senryu-ka which he will, after touching the ground, he'll make a powerful slash motion with his opened fan, sending the tornado at its way. Using the moves learned in this style, the user can control the path of the tornado, however he needs to concentrate completely on keeping it up. The base duration of this technique are 3 posts, and for every 10 in control one additional post. Only useable twice a thread, pointless if the Senryu-ka stopped the technique on purpose or was stopped by force.	31	35	33	20	0	24	0	0	0
917	1	1	Reflect All Force 	Isshiki Ikoi Hanpatsu	Positioning: The practicioner is not mentally prepared to notice the proper place to position his shield to defend himself from an attack. Because of this most of the positioning the practicioner does actually involves getting himself behind the shield and not vice-versa which is the true nature of the art.Constitution: Very weak for the most part, sometimes the shock of the shield hitting anything is enough to make the practicioner stumble back a couple of steps.	2	2	5	Shield Jab: A very simple yet quick shield strike that can be used to hit the opponent. Shields that happen to have spikes on it tend to be dangerous weapon when combined with this move.Shield Slice: If the ends of a shield happened to be sharpened to cut one can easily run the shield by an opponent and perhaps cut the user. However sharpened shields like that tend to be rare or custom made.		5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
917	2	2	Reflect All Force 	Isshiki Ikoi Hanpatsu	Positioning: Actively sparring with other opponents has taught the practicioner that while hiding behind a shield works all good and well, moving the shield to meet the attack works even better and allows him to move around and fight back. However really fast or multiple attacks will prove to be more difficult to defend and quickly the user will resort to hiding behind the shield to save himself.Constitution: Getting better, the user is able to realize that a very quick and light attack is something he could most likely take and still stand ready. However even really strong attacks tend to be a problem for most practicioners as they stumble back while defending.Force: Getting hit by a shield jab by a practicioner in this stage can hurt pretty bad, but you'll most likely live as long as you're not stabbed by a spike.	2	2	5	Fake Charge: Consider an improvisational attack, this is used whenever the defender stumbles back. The defender takes this time to grab a look at the way the person is standing and then does a very quick dash. However instead of running into the opponent he strafes to the side of his attacker and uses his new position (now either the side or even behind the opponent to fight at an advantage.Shield Slap: While a jab comes forward this shield attack insteads come from the side and is generally aimed for the head. When the fighter becomes stronger he can use this attack to make his opponent stand on one foot while the other is in the air.		8	0	6	0	0	6	0	0	0
917	3	3	Reflect All Force 	Isshiki Ikoi Hanpatsu	Positioning: Most likely having been in a few actual fights where lives were at risk the practicioner has realized that sometimes a fighter will attack immediatly after one attack has been been blocked. As such the practioner would now immediatly move his arm or entire body to block another attack. When it comes to an attack as long as the attack is coming in front of him he'll find a way to defend it, however attacks coming completely from the side or behind tend to give him problems.Constitution: Generally any kind of attack that's coming from someone of the same rank that is weaker then him will not even cause the practicioner to flinch in reaction, even really strong attacks. However fierce attacks from people who are as strong as him he'll most likely feel shock from his shield, and anyone of higher rank the practicioner finds himself stumbling back.Force: Getting hit by a shield jab hurts and sometimes additional pain will sometimes hurt as well for a post or so depending on what your rank is like when compared the practicioner.	2	2	5	Parry: Sometimes instead of blocking a move the practicioner just swings his shield and deflect an attack away from him leaving the opponent to be attacked. Parries also tend to be easier to perform on blades if a shield happens to have points on the end of it so a blade is easier to move away.Push: Sometimes a weapon user can attempt to add additional force to his weapon after an attack to bring the fighter to his knees. This is when the fighter pushes his shield forward and pushes the opponent away from him.Shield Shave: Sometimes blocky makabishi are wielded to the front of a shield in a 5" by 5" square on the shield. While this can prove helpful when you jab the shield into someone's face one can easily bring the shield up to someone's body and rub it down or up, grating pieces of clothing, armor, and skin on the opponent depending on where it was hit. However for one to do so one must have makabishi wielded to their shield of course.Real Charge: Generally done in the same fashion as a Fake Charge but not necessarily requiring the practicioner to stumble back the user will put all his force and speed into a charge and knock his opponent back.	Name: Chakra Coating Shield TechniqueRequirements: Power 10, Control 10, Reserves 8Description: Generally ninjutsu tends to be a problem when it comes to defending with a shield. Some forms of fire will heat the shield up, while others forms of elemental attacks such as lightning still hurts regardless of blocking. That's why shinobi practioners of this taijutsu learned this move, more or less it is a barrier of chakra that coats the shield and slowly disperses when hit by another ninjutsu. However if the ninjutsu happens to be a projectile type that independently moves on it's own without any additional aid from the shinobi this technique can redirect the ninjutsu back to it's user.This move was originally created in Water Country when two Mist Nins got bored and started to swat a suiton at each other with chakra coated shields in a very primitive form of tennis.	10	0	10	0	0	8	0	0	0
917	4	4	Reflect All Force 	Isshiki Ikoi Hanpatsu	Positioning: Slowly forming into some kind of improvised beginner-like kata the user anything that the user can physically see in front of his view can most likely be blocked with his shield. He will also begin using his free hand do other things as well such as grabbing the opponent. However defense on his blind sides tend to be a problem still especially when someone is behind the fighter.Constitution: Blocked attacks from people of the same rank doesn't even phase the defender, even lesser grade people of a higher rank tend to have a problem making the practicioner struggle, stronger ones can still make him flinch with a decent amount of strength behind an attack, but anyone higher then one rank up tends to give the defender some problems when it comes to defending and still standing.Force: The blunt force from a shield jab to the head at this stage can leave someone trying to remember what they were doing for a couple moments.	2	2	5	Shield Throw: Finally able to hold his own physically in a fight the shinobi may choose to take an advantage of distance remove his sheild from his arm and throw it like a heavy frisbee. This can be an all to dangerous of move for someone who is realizing that the ends of a shield have been sharpened to cut someone, but blunt shields also tend to do some damage as well. However accuracy and distance tend to be a common problem since throwing a shield is... well... new to them. Also you are left with the unfortunate occurance of trying to get your shield back.Note: Only round shields can be thrown at this stage.Self-Sacrifice: An overall passive move, the user quickly dashes in front of his teammate and defends him from being attacked. Giving his teammate time to get up and run away or figure out a strategy. It generally is also used a distraction since the fighter is now officially in front of the attacker and in the way.	Name: Chakra EdgeRequirements: Power 15, Control 15, Reserves 13Description: Now able to a concentrate Chakra specifically on the edges of the sheild one can swing the end of a shield and cut something, shield fighters who already have the ends of their shield sharpened and do their move notice they don't have to be as close to cut someone.	15	12	16	0	0	14	0	0	0
917	5	5	Reflect All Force 	Isshiki Ikoi Hanpatsu	Positioning: Becoming more used to such concepts as footwork, moving the waist, and holding people back with a free hand the fighter is able to block points of his blind side as well. But getting hit from behind still remains to be a problem.Constitution: Almost grazing the point of being considered immovable only people with more strength then the fighter tend to find themselves being able make him stuble. By this point if you're not stronger then the fighter and intend to make him move only mid-strength ninjutsu techniques will do the job.Force: A jab or slap from the will send you back a couple feet or ground your sorry rear end to the ground if you don't watch it. You're also screwed if there's a point on the end of that bad boy and you don't defend yourself.Throwing Ability: Generally you'll hit your target if he doesn't change his direction.	2	2	5	Revised Shield Throw: While not really a revision, but more so an ability. While those with round shields have been throwing their shields for some time now those with square shields have finally accumulated the strength and skill to throw their shields like a spear. This can be a very crafty move for those who have points on the end of their shield, as the can now force a door shut or pin someone's appendage to a wall or tree if he's lucky.		20	14	22	2	0	14	0	0	0
917	6	6	Reflect All Force 	Isshiki Ikoi Hanpatsu	Positioning: Sometimes performing vaults and spins are the only way that a practicioner of the art can position himself to make sure the attacker doesn't hit him, and he will do so to make sure it doesn't happen. Sometimes fighters are known to wear additional pieces of armor on their body so they can fight a number of people at once. Being attacked from behind is possible, but can be defended with enough effort.Constitution: Some people often compare moving the practicioner from his defending spot like uprooting a tree. Even the jounins who have a decent amount of ability in a taijutsu have problems doing it sometimes. Ninjutsu is the only well known way to always get them moving and even then the power has to be damn good.Force: Sometimes a practicioner will playfully hit someone with their shield... and they'll complain that he's to abusive because it hurts so bad. The user is barely aware of his own strength.Throwing Ability: Round Shield throwers will now throw their shields at an arc to collect more power before it actually hits someone, also the arc compensates for the fact that sometimes the shield is not thrown accurately and will sometimes hit the target anyways. Round shields that are built aerodynamically to be thrown will return back to its user after hitting something unless a decent powered force strays it horribly off course.Square shield throwers tend to throw their shield so hard that if it hits something solid enough it will be close to where they are standing. One way or another if a shield user throws at their full potential the shield will cleanly go through a tree and still continue moving.	2	2	5			26	19	30	16	0	20	0	0	0
917	7	7	Reflect All Force 	Isshiki Ikoi Hanpatsu	Positioning: One can easily position their shield to block an attack, however sometimes even the fastest attackers can sometimes get the best of him. Also being attacked from behind is a possibility but the practicioner can block behind him easier, however it is still an easier vantage point then from the front.Consitution: Running into someone who has their feet firmly planted on the ground in this stage more likely hurts you then the other person. Physical attacks that hit the shield generally do not cause the practicioner to move. But most mid to high powered ninjutsu will make a fighter of this style about moving still during this fight.Force: While most forms of combat involving hitting someone with the shield can cause some pretty painful fractured. Hitting someone in the face with your shield can break a nose or seperate a jaw.Throwing Ability: Throwing was already perfected in the last stage, there is almost no difference in this stage. Accuracy makes a little change but the fact is if you get hit by the shield, it's really going to hurt. The truth however is one can dodge the shield simply by ducking or jumping.However one really cool skill that most practicioners can do now thanks to the added force one can throw the shield one can bounce the shield off of object to hit someone at an angle they're not expecting.	2	2	5			30	29	40	23	0	21	0	0	0
916	1	1	Acupuncture Style 	Shinjutsu Ryuu	Alright, not too bad here. The practitioner is now learning the basics of his craft. Holding and throwing his needles with practiced ease. Angles of throws and learning the accuracy ranges of their throws are stressed at this stage, however, more than likely there will be a noticeable difference between dominant and weak hand throws.Hitting moving targets is a little difficult. In terms of hand-to-hand, the user is better than people without any formal training, they can read attacks and weave and dodge them with relative ease, however fighting multiple people gets a little strenuous. They will find noted difficulty keeping up with the strength of those with formal taijutsu training, however. Otherwise, they will be faster than the normal practitioner. Hitting pressure points is a little difficult here.	a	5	4			0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
916	2	2	Acupuncture Style 	Shinjutsu Ryuu	A slight step up from the previous stage. Most notably the improvements here are in being able to hold more needles in hand and hitting moving targets, however those that are pretty fast are still pretty hard to catch with the user's eye. Anticipation of the target has gotten slightly better, though immediate reaction to what the user is seeing is still par for the course. The gap between throwing hands has been closed more, but still noticeable to the trained eye. The practice of holding senbon like claws is introduced here, adding a new element--- and slightly longer reach into the mix. In hand to hand, the user is taught to weave between their target's attacks and confuse them with feints and low attacks while quicker jabs and swipes are stressed here.Throwing accurately from far away at multiple targets is still rather difficult.	a	5	4		Numbing LimbThis technique targets 3 pressure points of one of the victim's limbs. If the points are hit, a numbing sensation will overtake the limb. This lasts for as long as the needles are in the targets body, after the needles are removed, it lasts for one post.	0	8	6	6	0	0	0	0	0
916	3	3	Acupuncture Style 	Shinjutsu Ryuu	Finally, the gap between the throwing hands has been erased. The user can now throw extremely accurately at stationary targets and moving ones, they can hit with real consistency. The user can also double the amount of senbon they hold in one hand to six. Even now with moving targets that are faster than the user, he is starting to be able to pinpoint targets with anticipation of where they are going to be. Here, the user is getting used to throwing their needles with primarily their wrists instead of full arm swings, enabling them to throw their handfuls quicker. At this stage, the user is getting more comfortable throwing at multiple targets. In terms of pressure points, they are starting to be able to indentify body points instead of just limb points. Hitting them consistently however, is a different story.In terms of movement, the user is learning how to better manipulate their own space - that is to say, where they are in relation to everything else in their environment. Dodging in between targets, engaging more than one person, using their surroundings as cover, all of these skills are being developed further.	a	5	4		Minor Rejuvenation - Medical SkillThis technique targets 5 pressure points on a target (typically comrade) that regulate pain tolerance. If these spots are hit properly, the target will experience a temporary increase in one level of stamina (one post).	0	10	10	8	0	0	0	0	0
916	4	4	Acupuncture Style 	Shinjutsu Ryuu	Pairing now with throwing with the wrist, the user is now utilizing quicker draws from their holsters to speed up their throws and recollect more needles for their throwing attack. It isn't uncommon for the students to have compartments, weapon seals or hidden holsters in various areas of their clothing to summon their weapons quicker. Attacking just about any pressure point on the body with marginal accuracy is possible.Manipulation of space and their own natural physical capabilities comes into a new level where they are a lot more comfortable engaging anyone around their own skill level and multiples of people who are below their level of skill. The user's dexterity enables them to vary the lengths of individual needles that stick out from their hands to throw or leave in a target while they keep the others. Their anticipation of moves and movement patterns has started to become rather impressive now. In hand to hand, counters come quicker and they can put themselves in better position to parry attacks.	a	5	4		Limb ParalysisThis technique targets 6 pressure points of one of the victim's limbs. If the points are hit, paralysis will overtake the limb. As long as the needles are in the limb, the effects are present. Once the needles have been removed, the effects disappear in two posts.	13	16	14	14	0	0	0	0	0
916	5	5	Acupuncture Style 	Shinjutsu Ryuu	At this stage, the user's throwing technique grows the most. Needles are able to be thrown out in various lines and in different ways in order to either better hit a moving target with more needles at once, or cut off and manipulate them into possibly a different route. Their speed and usage of space frustrates their various opponents, keeping them off balance with speedy attacks from up close and afar. Picking up pressure points on the body from a distance while the target is still moving is more than possible here and even up close, it's harder to tell whether or not the target has been stuck with needles or not.	a	5	4		Numbing Body Requirements: Limb ParalysisThis technique targets 9 pressure points over the body. If they are all struck, a numbing sensation overcomes the whole body. Motion is still possible but it will most likely be clumsy and the target is likely to hurt him or herself in the process. All physical capabilities are weakened by one level. This effect takes place after one post and lasts one post. NOTE: All of the points must be hit. If one needle misses the technique's effects do not take place.Moderate Rejuvenation - Medical Technique Requirements: Minor rejuvenationThis technique targets 10 pressure points on a target (typically comrade) that regulate pain tolerance and energy. If these spots are hit properly, the target will experience a temporary increase of level in stamina and speed for a two post duration.	15	21	20	16	0	0	0	0	0
916	6	6	Acupuncture Style 	Shinjutsu Ryuu	In terms of the style of attack itself, the last stage is where any significant jump in skill or tactics is noted. But here is where the techniques that were learned in previous stages are sharpened to a new level. In terms of anticipation, the user's ability to see attacks coming and use different environmental factors to their advantage is uncanny. Accuracy has taken its final jump here, and the user can make just about any throw they can think of and physically aim at any point they chose, even with other factors. Certainly, with the speed, stamina and intelligence that the user is likely to carry, it is not fun to fight a Shinjutsu Ryuu practitioner at this stage.	a	5	4		Body Paralysis Requirements: Numbing BodyThis technique targets 13 pressure points over the body. If they are all struck, a paralysis will overcome the whole body. Feeling is still possible. Once needles have been removed, the effects will gradually disappear in three posts. The paralysis takes a post to kick in. NOTE: All of the points must be hit. If one needle misses the technique's effects do not take place.	20	30	25	18	0	18	0	0	0
916	7	7	Acupuncture Style 	Shinjutsu Ryuu	The penultimate stage in this style. Again, like the previous stage, there isn't much of a jump here overall, but their experiences have sharpened them to be among the best in their field. Shinjutsu Ryuu practitioners here are armed with the ability to drastically improve their teammate's performance as well as end engagements almost instantaneously when necessary. Their speed is often wondrous to see, they manipulate themselves, their surroundings and opponents so magnificently that others accuse them of having a gift of foresight. Here, you will see many types of high-level shinobi. From the best medics in the field, to the most efficient elites in the class, Shinjutsu Ryuu practitioners are something to be feared.	a	5	4		Advanced Rejuvenation - Medical TechniqueRequirements: Moderate RejuvenationThis technique targets 15 pressure points on a target (typically comrade) that regulate pain tolerance, energy, and muscle use restrictions. If these spots are hit properly, the target will experience a temporary two level increase in stamina, speed, and strength for three posts.False Death Requirements: Body ParalysisThis technique targets three pressure points on the neck to induce unconsciousness and lower metabolism to the point where the heart beat and breathing become imperceptible. (Think of what Haku did to Zabuza to get him out of the fight with Kakashi). The effects last until the needles are removed, but if the needles are not removed by the end of the thread, the target will die. Also requires player consent.	30	36	33	22	0	22	0	0	0
915	1	1	Shadow Dance 	Kage Buyou	The shadow dance is characterized by swift movements, slight of hand, and a killing instinct. At this preliminary study of the basics of ninja techniques, the student studies the most basic tools of any shinobi's trade. The kunai is, traditionally, a small knife disguised as a farming implement. In the modern era, shinobi tend to use black knives that are very obviously tools of war, but any small sharp instrument (even an improvised rock, or a shard of glass) can be used. The fist wraps around the handle with the blade below. Shinobi who aren't otherwise studied in taijutsu tend to have a more rigid stance, holding their blade before them with their off-hand resting on the fist to help with control and stabbing power. The typical goal is simply to plunge the working end of your instrument into the flesh of the opponent - the vital areas of the throat, the stomach in particular. If the shinobi is already trained in taijutsu, they may be practiced enough to perform great feats with their kunai, meaning this study is simply reacclimating oneself to the basics. While using a kunai or equivalent tool in one hand, they may perform the special techniques in this list.		5	4	Parry and RiposteEvery Academy student learns how to block with a kunai, but the training of Kage Buyou lets a student go even further beyond. After a successful interception of a physical blow with a kunai, the user flees backwards as gracefully as if they were dancing, propelled backwards by the force of their opponent's attack. After blocking an attack, this technique adds 1 Level of Speed to the user only for the purposes of retreating, plus 1 more additional Level if their attacker has a higher Strength Level than their own.Caltrops (Ninpo: Makibishi)Most shinobi carry tiny barbed pieces of metal (also called makibishi) to delay pursuits, though they only tend to work against those wearing particularly thin and soft footwear. The Kage Buyou student has taken the time to painstakingly apply a variety of adhesives and paints to each caltrop, letting them stick onto walls and uneven surfaces while remaining disguised whenever they land. If the user has any poisons, they may also be applied to the caltrops when cast out.	Floating KunaiMisdirection is all it takes to turn a fight.While often derided in the Academy as'seamstresses' or'paper-folders', all the sewing the Kage Buyou student trains is for an important purpose. Although the process is time and labor intensive, tiny parachutes are created and sealed inside individual kunai. After being thrown a single seal may be formed, which releases a small cloth or paper parachute from a single kunai that slows their descent. The parachutes may even be decorated with a likeness of the user or some other object, which may surprise or fool an enemy for a moment. Any kunai thrown at any point in the thread may be revealed to have been a floating kunai.First Strike: the user may use and activate as many floating kunai in that post as reasonable.Prepared: the user may use two kunai parachutes in each hand to slow their own falling speed, preventing them from taking damage upon landing.Ninpo: Silent FootfallsA shinobi, traditionally, was a stealthy espionage agent.Nearly every shinobi worth their salt is taught how to move quietly. For those who want to go the extra mile (and not be heard), Kage Buyou offers an alternative solution. Rather than affecting how the user moves, this technique gives them better knowledge of where to move. Passively, the user always has a good idea of the best path through an area that generates the least amount of noise. This includes seemingly supernatural perception like knowing where to avoid a creaky set of stairs, or which path to take without disturbing an overhead flock of birds. This technique only works when moving at half their normal Speed Level.First Strike: the user's features are blurred for the post they are discovered, making them impossible to identify.Prepared: the user may move at full speed while using this technique.Ninpo: Shurikenjutsu (Ninja Art: Throwing Star Technique)The use of ninja projectiles is a common trait among shinobi.The shadow dancer makes use of shuriken or other projectiles to disrupt enemy movements, control positioning, and rarely to dispatch unaware or untrained opponents. A single unaltered projectile may be thrown in any post without consuming an action. This toss is done rapidly and in a general area, unable to strike specific vital points or small targets, but is good enough to hit unaware targets. This technique can be used once in the thread, plus one more time for each Stage known in this list.First Strike: multiple projectiles may be thrown in the post, but only so long as each one is aimed at a different target.Prepared:: the thrown projectile may be modified by other techniques in this list.	0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
915	2	2	Shadow Dance 	Kage Buyou	As the shinobi continues their training, they learn to operate with purpose. Their ability to quickly move their hands around the different holds for their chosen weapon is mastered, and they can easily form hand seals without dropping their tool. As they study their opponent, they start to find pathways to strike or get around their opponent, and movements are typically characterized by a circular movement. Training takes place on many forms of terrain, including on water and against walls for shinobi with that training, and the shinobi themselves are rarely ever caught off guard by natural, uneven terrain.		5	4	Kunai and Chain!A common sight on Academy training grounds are students swinging around in the trees with naught but a thread and a kunai tied to it. Most grow out of this technique as it becomes ineffective against more skilled opponents who simply cut the strings, but the Kage Buyou student has practiced it so many times and understands the principles of action well enough to integrate it seamlessly into combat. For the purposes of movement only, while swinging, the user gains 1 Speed Level. If the user manages to bind someone with their string and kunai, they can hold onto that target as if they had 1 additional Strength Level.Shadow StepHiding noise only goes so far- sometimes, hiding within noise works even better. Within seconds of hearing anything louder than a raindrop, the user can isolate and memorize its pattern and match their own footsteps and movements to the beat. Effectively as long as there is some source of rhythmic background noise (most often footsteps from another person), the user matches their body movements to it so perfectly as to be essentially undetectable to the normal ear.	Ninpo: Smoke bomb (Ninpo: Kemuridama)A sudden explosion of smoke can disguise movement.Standard issue shinobi smoke bombs are rather pathetic, llasting only a few seconds and covering only a small area. Even genin often opt to not carry them for how ineffectual they are in even the slightest of breezes. However the Kage Buyou student knows that's because most ignorant shinobi use them as if they were throwing kunai. If struck by any attack, the user may passively emit a small burst of white smoke as they release a smoke bomb onto themselves.First Strike: any normal attack the user makes can be augmented with a smoke cloud effect, either on themselves or the person they hit.Prepared: any target the user has touched in the thread may have a small smoke bomb the user secretly placed on them detonate instead.Behind Every Kunai, Another KunaiFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...The double bladed kunai is a rare item, not because it's valuable, but because there is very little demand for them from most shinobi. The double bladed kunai looks like a normal kunai, but mirrored lengthwise, like the needle on a compass. Passively, the user carries as many of these as they do normal kunai. When thrown the double kunai looks at a glance like a normal kunai, however upon impact, or when the user forms a half hand seal, the other half of the projectile splits off, and fires back the way it came. Only one double bladed kunai may be activated per post, though multiples may still be thrown.First Strike: any reasonable number of double bladed kunai can be thrown and activated in that post.Prepared: any normal kunai touched by the user in the thread can unfold to reveal itself to have been a double bladed kunai.	0	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0
915	3	3	Shadow Dance 	Kage Buyou	At this point in training, some Kage Buyou specialists move for a more specialized melee weapon for their melee hand while leaving their other hand free. The additional length of the weapon chosen offers extended range to the Kage Buyou's attack patterns, as well as makes it easier to parry and deal with opponent weapons, but also prevents the use of some specialized techniques learned specifically for short-bladed weapons such as kunai. The ability to manipulate kunai while attacking an opponent sees a steady increase here, as well.		5	4	Improvised Shinobi KitAlthough the Kage Buyou student knows all the best locations to restock the tools of their trade, sometimes there is no choice but to rely on homemade substitutes instead. Outside of combat and over the course of a post, the user may construct any item from their shinobi kit, provided they have appropriate materials. Inside combat there isn't as much time, and there is a one post delay between starting to make an item, and being able to use it.Kunai FootworkOnce a parlor trick, now the Kage Buyou student learns to launch kunai with not just their hands, but with their feet as well. Kunai can be effortlessly kicked whether in midair or from the ground, sending them flying with the same strength, speed, and precision as the user's normal kunai throws. Not only that, but with practice the user can even embed their kunai into soft surfaces and use them as footholds in the same post. This enables them to stand, walk, or run along embedded kunai, but only at half Speed.	Ninpo: Kage Buyou (Ninja Art: Shadow Dance)Perfectly mirroring an airborne opponent's trajectory, like the shadow of a leaf in the wind.Through an understanding of their body and careful movement and understanding what any one target is capable of perceiving, it becomes possible for the user to hide behind objects and people smaller than themselves. Passively, anything smaller than half the user's size can be perfectly hidden behind through clever positioning, even if that object is moving. This typically only conceals the user from a single target, however.First Strike: the user can increase their Speed Level to 1 Level less than the Speed of a target they are attacking. This is a hard limit on their Speed for that post, and no other bonuses may stack with it. In the following post the user's Speed Level is set to 1 for one post.Prepared: the user's keen eye is able to discern what items a single target has on their person, unless those items have the Hidden or Concealed modifiers.Ninpo: Izuna Otoshi (Ninja Art: Weasel Drop)Inspired by watching weasels attack in-flight birds by leaping out of trees, this technique is iconic across the shinobi world.The intimate knowledge of the physics of battle is put to use here, as any grappled target can end up in the mercy of the Kage Buyou student's dreaded Weasel Drop technique. Any target thrown by the user takes extra damage as they are hurled into the ground, usually after being forced to land on a fragile body part such as their head or the extremities. This is equivalent to 1 extra level of Strength for the attack, plus 1 more Level of Strength if the target happens to be airborne when grabbed by the user.First Strike: this technique may be repeated once more for a different target within arm's reach of the previous target, up to a number of times equal to the maximum Stage known in this list.Prepared: this technique can be done without making any additional noise, and muffles any noise made by the target.Ninpo: Shinkujin (Ninja Art: Vacuum Blades)An application of chakra to enhance thrown projectiles.The shinobi exhales a chakra-laden breath as they otherwise toss projectiles. All the projectiles they throw in that post have cutting edges extended by an invisible layer of chakra, up to double the length of the projectile.First Strike: the cutting edges can be extended by up to four times the length of the projectile.Prepared: instead of projectiles, a handheld weapon can be extended instead.	0	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0
915	4	4	Shadow Dance 	Kage Buyou	At this point in their training, shinobi are capable of performing great acts of subterfuge espionage. With the great patience to stalk a target for days or weeks or longer, they can wait for the ideal moment to quickly dispatch a target and disappear before anyone's the wiser. More so, shinobi that have reached this level of development have tended to go against other trained shinobi, rather than plying their trade on non-shinobi. As such, they've developed a series of techniques and methods for dealing with other ninjutsu martial artists.		5	4	Arrow CatchWhile most shinobi can become fast enough to dodge mundane projectiles, the Kage Buyou student learns to go just a bit further. All small projectiles or shinobi kit items thrown by those without either a projectile taijutsu style or projectile archetype can easily be caught or deflected by the user. Projectiles thrown by those with training require the user to have higher Speed Levels than the thrower, and even then the user must have seen the projectile before it was thrown in order to time the catch just right.Flash bombs (Ninpo: Hikaridama)Flash bombs are marble shaped paper balls that detonate into a short flash of light after thrown, which in the hands of most will do little more than a camera flash would. Rookie shinobi often age out of using these tools, as the typical unskilled ninja hurl them all at once for maximum coverage and find the bombs nothing more than a blink and you miss it distraction. The Kage Buyou student has learned to time their throws so precisely, launching each bomb one after the other, to create a series of perfectly timed flashes that disorients and blinds far longer than an entire handful of bombs going off at once could have produced. Passively, during any normal offensive action, flash bombs can be dropped in sequence for the duration of an entire post. This only allows sight for a brief moment in between each detonation, like watching a slideshow. The user themselves times their blinks in sync with the detonations, and are largely unaffected by their own flashes. If this technique is used for two posts in a row, the effect on targets is doubled, but the user's eyes become fatigued and the user is rendered blind for 1 post afterwards.	Ninpo: Ansatsu no Jutsu (Ninja Art: Assassination Technique)Passively, as long as some part of their body touches the shadow of a target, the user cannot be seen by that target. This only prevents that single target from directly seeing the user, as they will only perceive them as their shadow, but does not stop a target from detecting the user through other senses such as smell or sound. Truly skilled Kage Buyou students have even been said to use the brief shadows formed by flash bombs to dart undetected to a target, appearing to teleport as a result. This is sometimes called the "Silent Killing" method, particularly among Kirigakure swordsmen.First Strike: the user will appear only as the target's shadow when attacking.Prepared: If the user's Stamina Level exceeds that of the target, as long as they are Prepared and remain in the target's shadow, none of the target's senses can detect their presence.Let Me Borrow That!A special coating of chakra surrounds the off hand of the user. When the weapon in their other hand makes contact with another target capable of using chakra, they may begin forming half hand seals with their off hand, pulling the chakra from their target to perform the jutsu. If the target breaks contact before the jutsu is used, the user may perform the jutsu with normal hand seals in their next post, consuming the target's usages (with no scaling) instead of their own. If the target grabs the off hand of the user this stops their chakra from being stolen, however the user can complete the jutsu by consuming their own usages and forcing the target to complete the other half of the hand seals instead.Ninpo: Wire Strings (Ninja Art: Wire Strings)Wire strings are sturdy, metallic tools used for rappelling, trapping, and containing.By performing a single hand seal, previously hidden ninja wires reveal themselves. These wires appear as if by magic, but were in fact placed by the user- so they cannot appear anywhere the user couldn't have reasonably reached in the thread. Upon activation the strings snap and coil tightly, binding with a Strength Level of 4 for 2 posts. The strings are normal strings, however, and can still be cut.First Strike: the strings may be replaced with razor wire.Prepared: the strings may bind with the user's Strength Level for 1 post instead.	14	14	14	0	0	14	0	0	0
915	5	5	Shadow Dance 	Kage Buyou	Typically, shinobi of this level of skill are considered jounin or the equivalent in their village. Their mastery of shinobi killing techniques gives them the experience needed to lead squads and operate completely solo. Their names or code names are a whispered secret, occasionally a storied folklore character of the region. More astute shinobi villages may have put the shinobi's name in their Bingo Books, or even declared a "run on site" order for these deadly assassins.		5	4	[Coated] Shinobi KitItems in the shinobi kit may be treated as possessing the Coated modifier.Rooted StrikeAny number of shinobi kit items may be attached to any normally performed ninjutsu by consuming a Stage Five usage when the ninjutsu is first used. Most often this is used to attach explosive notes to ninjutsu, but a spray of projectiles or plume of smoke or other combinations are occasionally used as well.	Ninpo: Kunai BreakBy pouring so much chakra into a kunai or similar item that it becomes visible to the human eye, the edge of the weapon becomes supernaturally sharp. This effect is like a much smaller, much quieter Chidori, increasing the cutting ability of the weapon significantly for a single post. This increased cutting power doesn't change the types of materials the kunai can cut through, but makes it far easier to cut through the materials it normally could, as if passing through air. 2 post cooldown.First Strike: the cutting ability is equal to a Chidori.Prepared: materials as hard as metals may be cut through over the course of a post.Ninpo: Kaiten ShurikenShuriken are thrown in such a way that they begin to orbit around the shinobi for 3 posts. The individual shuriken can then be sent out at any number of targets in later posts. One shuriken can be sent into orbit for every Stage known in this list. Variations of this technique are famous amongst assassins - famously used in attempts to quickly take out superior opponents, such as attempting to assassinate a rival Kage.First Strike: shuriken thrown with this technique can be considered to have the Elemental modifier.Prepared: the orbiting shuriken have no duration, but the user can no longer be considered Prepared as long as the shuriken are orbiting them.Ninpo: Shinkuken (Ninja Art: Shockblade)A sudden application of force and chakra, sending a blade of wind through the air!With Ninja Art: Shockblade, the user swings their primary weapon with both hands, with enough force that sends a shockwave through the air that disrupts all mundane projectiles in its range. This technique sends a blast of air equal to their own Strength Level in a cone 15 feet in front of them as well.First Strike: the air blast extends to 30 feet, and hits with twice the Strength Levels on airborne targets.Prepared: this technique can deflect ninjutsu Stage Four and below.	18	20	18	0	0	16	0	0	0
915	6	6	Shadow Dance 	Kage Buyou	Silent Killing, is a term that's been used for members that have reached this level of technique. Moving swiftly and quietly, they use their tools to great effect to take on very many targets at once. Typically they show up to an area before nightfall, and by the time the sun rises, every target in the area has been dispatched. Even just wielding a standard kunai, their finesse and familiarity with this simple tool has become unparalleled. Here, the shinobi's training has gifted an understanding of the human body and its inherent weaknesses.		5	4	Poisoned Pressure PointsAlthough not as precise or penetrating as senbon, kunai can serve a roughly similar function for the easier to target pressure points on the human body. Up to 4 kunai are thrown at a living target. If hit, the target becomes afflicted by any universal poison of the user's choice, which has a cost equal to or less than the number of kunai that drew blood in that post. Because this technique ruins the pressure point after it is struck, each target may only be affected by this technique once per thread.Hand to Hand: ReversalThe eyes of the Kage Buyou are so attuned to look for weaknesses, that even seeing the ethereal power of ninjutsu is nearly in their grasp. Passively, mundane projectiles hurled by untrained targets can be caught and thrown back in the same post at no action cost. With a kunai in hand, the user may catch a ninjutsu projectile with the tip of their weapon, then hurl both the ninjutsu and their projectile at a new target in the same post. This consumes a Stage Six usage, as well as a usage of the Stage of the jutsu caught, and only jutsu 2 Stages lower than the highest known in this list may be caught this way. This technique has a 2 post cooldown.	Ninpo: Repeated Unsealed Explosive NotesAn assassination technique famous from the Warring States period.A special, one time use explosive note is issued to the Kage Buyou student, and kept in a safe spot in the shinobi kit. Upon activation the explosive note detonates 361 times, with the timing of each blast set such that the explosions last between 1 to 3 posts. Usable once per thread, and no additional explosive notes may be used for the remainder of the thread.First Strike: Any explosive notes in the radius of the blast belonging to both friend and foe are also forcibly detonated.Prepared: the explosive note may be thrown with such a spin that it continues on in a straight path for its duration, unless stopped by something that it cannot blow up.Silent NinjutsuAny jutsu or technique that is performed and remains within arm's reach of the user is completely silent, both in its activation and any effects it causes afterwards. Any part of the jutsu or technique which extends past the user's reach causes its normal amount of noise. If a jutsu or technique is modified with this ability, it is the only action the user can take in that post.First Strike: Anyone touched and within arm's reach of the user has their own sounds completely muted for one post.Prepared: Any allies within arm's reach of the user have their own sounds completely muted in their post following the user.	24	27	24	0	18	18	0	0	0
915	7	7	Shadow Dance 	Kage Buyou	Nindo - the way of the ninja.		5	4	Demonic AuraA legacy of assassinations follows the Kage Buyou expert and that burning killing intent pulses in their heart and with every breath they take. At will, an immense aura of killing intent can be emitted to anyone laying eyes on the user. This strikes fear in the heart of lesser combatants - and even the most stalwart can't deny they are in the presence of something beyond human. When out of combat, this aura is so overwhelming that even if the user is spotted, many would choose to flee or pretend they didn't see the demonic presence they stumbled on, knowing that raising the alarm would be far worse for their fate.Ninja Art: Four Winds (Ninpo: Shikazehai)Kunai are hurled in all directions, seemingly at random but in actuality with an extreme amount of precision. These kunai ricochet and bounce and fly into a clanging sea of chaos while the Kage Buyou expert seemingly avoids all collateral damage, dancing between his own projectiles as if they were not there. Every post two handfuls of mundane, unaltered projectiles may be thrown, without consuming an offensive or defensive action. These projectiles can only be generally aimed in a direction and are not precise, but still hit with the same power as a normally thrown projectile.	Ninja Art: One Strike (Ninpo: Hissatsu)A lifetime of study has lead to this final strike.Two kunai are stabbed into a target, one with each hand. One kunai sinks into the chest, and the other the back of the neck. As long as the kunai in the chest is embedded, no taijutsu (along with bonuses) may be used. As long as the kunai in the neck is embedded, no usages of any kind may be consumed. Neither wound is lethal, so long as the kunai remain in place, and if both kunai stay in place for the duration of the thread, the damage is permanent and the target gains two seals at the kunai locations which seal both taijutsu and all usages so long as the seals remain in place. The seals can only be removed by someone of sennin rank. If both kunai are removed in the thread, then the target regains use of their techniques for two posts, but will perish immediately at the end of the thread if they do not succumb sooner. If any kunai are removed a large and potentially lethal amount of damage is sustained, and the matching set of techniques is unsealed. Only the target may remove their own kunai.First Strike: the user replenishes one Stage Seven usage each time the target removes a kunai.Prepared: Any weapon may be used with this technique instead of a kunai.Ninpo: Empty Heart, Empty MindBe as fleeting as a dream.By purging their body of chakra and expelling it silently, the user emits an aura that affects anyone who lays eyes on them. For three posts, any action the user takes while in shadow will not be remembered by those who see them perform the action. Those affected will find themselves suddenly experiencing gaps in their memory, and will have no capacity to see or recognize the user while they are under this effect. Those affected have a second at most to respond before their memory is wiped. No ninjutsu may be used in this state.Shinobi Kit: HammerspaceA tool for every occasion.This technique is passive, however it is only active in a thread where the user has no inventory apart from their shinobi kit. The Kage Buyou student has become such a connoisseur of items, such a wily merchant and purveyor of goods, that now their inventory has become truly expanded. The shinobi kit of the user now includes as many basic non-combat items/non-weapons in the standard item list as the user wishes. The complete list is below:Limb armor, breathing apparatus, zoom goggles, razor wire, body armor, hallucinogenic poison, gas grenades, night vision goggles, debilitating poison, antidotes, shields, large shields, lethal poison (total point value: 26+)	30	39	30	0	22	21	0	0	0
914	1	1	Close Combat Archery 	Sekkinsen Kyuujutsu	Close combat: Not very skilled at all, the user has only learned the actual theory behind using archery in close combat.Ranged combat: The user can hit a target from a distance of 50 meters or so. Can only fire one arrow per post.Footwork: At this stage it is more about building up the flexibility and strength in the legs that are required later on in the style. Very basic defensive tactics are taught.	5	2	2			6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
914	2	2	Close Combat Archery 	Sekkinsen Kyuujutsu	Close Combat: The user has now acquired enough skill in dodging that they may actually use the archery in melee. While they still can't fire more than one arrow in the midst of a fight, from point-blank range an arrow is very hard to avoid.Ranged combat: One of the greater traits of the close combat version of the bow is that it is completely ambidextrous. That means that directly after firing one arrow, the user can switch hands and fire another one within a moment. This means that the user can fire off two arrows within a single post. At this stage the user can accurately hit a target in the range of 90 meters. But if they fire two arrows the accuracy of the second arrow will be worse than the first one. Footwork: The user's movement are now shaping up as they can move and fire the bow without the slightest problem.	5	2	2	Fushichou Tsuki (Phoenix Thrust)The user attempts to grab their enemy by the throat with their 'bow-hand' while retracting the bowstring at the same time. If they succeed in their grab, they will fire an arrow that will go straight for the throat, the opponents movements temporarily sealed. This can also be carried it without actually grabbing the opponent, but with a chance of the opponent managing to avoid.		10	0	0	0	0	6	0	0	0
914	3	3	Close Combat Archery 	Sekkinsen Kyuujutsu	Close combat: While the user has not mastered melee-archery, they have by now understood the trick of it and can now use it effectively. They can fire off two arrows per post with the ambidextrous way of doing it.Ranged combat: The user can now accurately hit a target within 130 meters. They can fire off two arrows without the slightest deduction in accuracy, or shoot a third one which will receive a similar accuracy reduction as in earlier stages.Footwork: The Sekkinsen Kuujutsu users will mostly find themselves moving backwards in order to avoid attacks. At this stage the user can move as quickly backward as they can run forward, capable of short boosts of speed.	5	2	2	Kage Isshi no jutsu (Shadow Arrow Technique)The user launches two arrows in quick succession, the second arrow tracing in the exact shadow of the first one.		12	0	8	0	0	8	0	0	0
914	4	4	Close Combat Archery 	Sekkinsen Kyuujutsu	Close Combat: At this stage the user has clearly refined his skills in close combat archery and his movements are getting more precise and exact. They have become accustomed to the high pace of a close combat pace and thus their accuracy has gotten a lot better.Ranged combat: The user can now accurately hit a target within 170 meters. Three arrows can be fired in one post without any accuracy deduction and they can be aimed at two separate targets. Footwork: The user's movement have now slowly starting to become flowing as they learn how to precisely shift their balance as they move. Their body has become flexible and they can also use their excellent footwork in an offensive way, dashing in close avoiding enemy attacks.	5	2	2	Hanshateki Ya (Reflecting Arrow)Firing off an arrow toward what has to be a hard surface (rock, metal) the arrow will ricochet off the surface and hit the target in a blind spot (mostly in the back or from below)Takuboku Kuchibashi (Woodpecker Beak)The user dashes forward within an opening left by an enemy attack, fire off two arrows aimed at the exact same spot, the first hitting the other one from behind making the first one pierce the enemy even deeper.		21	7	15	0	0	14	0	0	0
914	5	5	Close Combat Archery 	Sekkinsen Kyuujutsu	Close Combat: The user can now fire off two arrows at once (Robin Hood style) since the actual decrease in accuracy when firing that way doesn't mean much on such close range. This of course means that they can potentially fire four arrows in one post with an accuracy decrease of course. Ranged combat: The user can now accurately hit a target within 170 meters. They can now fire off four arrows in one post aimed at three separate targets with a slight decrease in accuracy. Footwork: At this stage this style prioritises a greater variation in the actual defensive pattern of the character, switching from quick dashes to swaying backward, while also countering the enemy with numerous arrows.	5	2	2	Shuryou Taka Renge (Hunting Hawk combo)The user jumps up and fire off four darts while in the air as fast as they can, the arrows accurately aimed at the joints connecting the shoulder-arms and the hip-legs.		26	10	20	0	0	16	0	0	0
914	6	6	Close Combat Archery 	Sekkinsen Kyuujutsu	Close Combat: At this stage they can now fire off four arrows in one post without any real decrease in accuracy. Their reflexes have grown more accustomed to the high pace and as such their accuracy is greater now than before. They can fire at two different targets as well.Ranged combat: The user can now accurately hit a target within 210 meters. They can now fire off four arrows in one post aimed at four separate targets without the slightest decrease in accuracy.Footwork: At this stage the user's offence and defence are formidable and they can easily switch from them in a heartbeat. Their movements are fluid and kept at a minimum, no useless movement at all. They have acquired a flexible body that can dodge an attack only to land a decisive counter in return.	5	2	2	Hiyou no Suzume (Swallow's Flight)The user aims a low sweeping kick in order to trip the opponent, after which they will jump away while quickly launching four arrows at the opponent. A technique used to take distance from a dangerous close quarter fight.		32	18	25	0	16	20	0	0	0
914	7	7	Close Combat Archery 	Sekkinsen Kyuujutsu	Close Combat: The user's accuracy and reflexes are now completely flawless. He can fire off six shots in one post, also able to split the fire between three targets. Ranged combat: The user can now accurately hit a target within 250 meters. He can now fire off five darts at five separate targets in a single post. Footwork: The user's footwork and dodging abilities is a true marvel to behold. Every movement is so precise and effective that they can keep avoiding their opponent with a minimum amount of movements.	5	2	2	Hanshateki Ame (Reflecting Rain)Pretty much the same as 'Hanshateki no Ya' except that the user can now fire off all six of his arrows to ricochet from a solid surface in order to hit a maximum of three targets		40	25	34	0	24	24	0	0	0
913	1	1	Hidden Sniper	None	At this stage the archer is not very patient, unable to wait for that perfect shot and content with the less perfect targets. At this beginning stage, power leaves much to desire, and arrows are only able to travel at a speed of 25Draw: Drawing the arrow from the quiver and bringing it to the bow is an awkward and slow process. It is not smooth in the least, so archers should be prepared with arrows at hand or already strung when engaging an opponent.Accuracy: Not so great. Although the archer's accuracy is noticeably better than those not trained in this style, in comparison to later stages, they are inferior. Accuracy is at 100% at 25 meters away, and can still hit a target from distances of 90 meters.Cover: Archers are capable of spotting ideal places for hiding, but cannot conceal their movements very well. Basically, while they know where to hide, they are unable to utilize this knowledge.		5	4			0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
913	2	2	Hidden Sniper	None	Patience and power are starting to show at this stage. Archers can wait for a good shot, but are not capable of waiting for an even better shot to reveal itself. The power of the arrows are equal to a speed of 35.Draw: Drawing the arrow is still awkward, but not as slow. While the archer is faster he's much clumsier, prone to dropping arrows in an attempt to draw one fast.Accuracy: It's improved. Shots are more accurate than in the previous stage due to more patience. Accuracy is at 100% at 30 meters away, and can still hit target at distances of 130 meters.Cover: Now more adapt at using the knowledge granted to them from the study of concealment and camouflage, the user is now able to move to his place of hiding more easily. However, maintaining cover is a problem, and movements such as knocking an arrow, raising his bow, and even loud breathing still serve as tells to their location.		5	4			0	8	6	0	6	0	0	0	0
913	3	3	Hidden Sniper	None	Patience is a virtue that is difficult to learn. The archer might wait a little longer for the best possible shot, but is still reluctant to do so. The power behind each bolt has improved significantly; the speed of the arrows is 40.Draw: The archer's draw is no longer awkward, but is still far from speedy. Attempts at repeated quick drawing will result in a lack of fluidity in the motion, and therefore slower, smoother draws are preferred at this stage.Accuracy: Patience continues to pay off. Accuracy is at 100% at 40 meters away, and targets up to 180 meters can be realistically attempted.Cover: The archer can find adequate cover with ease. Not only that, but the ability to sit motionless and go undetected is close to second nature. Finally the hidden part of this style is coming into play.		5	4	Deflection shotUsing trees, rocks or other parts of the landscape, the archer fires an arrow so that it deflects off of what would usually be considered obstacles. The arrows can bounce off one obstacle, and an addition obstacle for every stage above this one. The deflection shot's accuracy is equal to the accuracy of one stage lower than the archer's current stage.		0	11	9	0	8	0	0	0	0
913	4	4	Hidden Sniper	None	This stage is a turning point in the style. The archer is patient and willing enough to wait for the best shot possible for as long as it takes. Power has reached a new plateau, and arrows now move at a speed of 45.Draw: Now capable of drawing arrows both quickly and smoothly, the archer is subsequently able to fire his arrows in quicker succession in order to maintain a constant assault.Accuracy: New, wonderful progress has been made in this style. The archer can now pull off shots with the accuracy of stage 3 while in motion. While in sniper mode, however, Accuracy is at 100% at 60 meters, and shots up to 210 meters away can be realistically attempted.Cover: Furthering improving upon their ability to use cover to their advantage, the user has now managed to mask his breath and conceal the necessary actions of a sniper. However, while they have learned to hide these advanced tells, they are still not perfect at the performance, and therefore repeated attempts at movements would prove to be difficult.		5	4	Arrow ScatterThe archer fires multiple arrows at the target. Initially this technique allows 2 arrows to be fired at once, but for each stage after this one another additional arrow may be fired simultaneously. This shot's accuracy is equal to one stage lower than the archer's current stage.	Hunter's SightMaintaining visual confirmation of a target is one of the most important hallmarks of the sniper. Therefore, obviously, one of the most effective methods of defending against one who seeks to strike from afar would be to obstruct the assassin's vision. As a result, snipers have learned to maintain a flow of chakra to their eyes in order to bypass the two most common obstructions: darkness and smoke. With this jutsu active, nighttime would appear as bright as day (though in black and white), and smoke would seem as transparent as air. This visionary enhancement requires a constant flow of chakra to maintain, as well as an extra surge of chakra in order to activate its power.	11	17	15	0	14	0	0	0	0
913	5	5	Hidden Sniper	None	Power has seen noticeable improvement. The speed in which the arrows fly is amazing; arrows fly faster than any senbon or kunai. Arrows fly at a speed equivalent to a shinobi with 50 speed (refer to the Taijutsu section of the Handbook for a better idea of this speed.)Draw: Not much change, except that it's faster. Archer's might start to dangle arrows from between their fingers to shorten the drawing time.Accuracy: Shots can be made in motion with the accuracy of stage 4. Normal shots are 100% accurate at 70 meters away, and shots can realistically be attempted from 270 meters away.Cover: The archer can stay hidden for hours and remain undetected. No unnecessary motions are made while hidden, and any movement that is made is made without disturbing the area in which the archer is hidden.		5	4		PhantomThe archer can hide amongst any natural cover without revealing his presence. There is literally no trace of the archer at all. Nothing except for a jutsu could possibly locate him/her. This perfect cover is blown after firing an arrow, however, this cover can be maintained for every additional stage after this one. This means that for those with stage 7, 3 arrows can be fired without revealing the archer's location.	16	21	19	0	16	0	0	0	0
913	6	6	Hidden Sniper	None	Power continues to improve. The speed of the arrow is now equivalent to a shinobi with 60 speed.Draw: Drawing an arrow is one quick, fluid motion. No mistakes are made when drawing and knocking an arrow; it's done so fast and precise that drawing in the midst of battle is no longer a problem.Accuracy: shots can be made in motion with the accuracy of stage 5. Normal shots are 100% accurate at 80 meters, and shots can be attempted from distances as far as 270 meters.Cover: The archer is even more silent than before. Breathing is completely concealed, as is every other motion. The only thing non-jutsu related that could give away the archer's position is firing an arrow.		5	4			22	28	25	0	20	16	0	0	0
913	7	7	Hidden Sniper	None	Patience improves once more; the archer can literally wait days, or even weeks, for a perfect shot. They will not move, will not eat or drink, and will even urinate on the spot before leaving. Power has increased phenomenally; the speed of the arrow is equivalent to a shinobi with 70 speed.Draw: Not much to improve at this point. Drawing is smooth, flawless, and fails to impede the archer in any way.Accuracy: Shots can be made in motion with the accuracy of stage 6. Normal shots are perfect up to 100 meters away, and can be attempted at distances up to 400 meters.Cover: No improvement remains to be made, like the stage before, the sniper is essentially a phantom.		5	4			28	38	33	0	24	20	0	0	0
912	1	1	Fluid Fist	Ekitai-Kenfu	When the student is ready, the master will appear.'This age-old proverb finds new meaning in the first steps taken by the fledgling Fluid-Fist fighter. Only through proper preparation will the road to mastery reveal itself. The student and master are one and the same, a current that begins at the river's source and ends at the infinite sea. As such, the focus of this stage is to highlight the principles that will direct progression: precision over power and insight over strength.'Empty your cup so that it may be filled; become devoid to gain totality.'By emptying their cup - their preconceived opinions and expectations - the student opens themselves up to the possibilities of the Ekitai-Kenfu, learning the body's movements and the correct positioning of each part within the whole. Thus, whether striking or defending with hands or feet, the fighter's motions will follow the line of their intent to the letter, flowing through practiced forms.At this stage, strikes are nearly always soft in nature. However, this does not mean that they are slow. Like water, the hands flow but the feet crash; at this early stage, they are the first and thus most developed part of the moving body with which energy can be generated and so possess a heightened natural power, although an overemphasis on kicks at this stage can risk interrupting the student's rhythm. Hence, balance exercises are also introduced.Incapacitating one's opponent is not a matter of trial and error but of practice. Compared to later stages, the Kata of Basics demands the most from the trainee by offering the greatest wealth of new information in return. For instance, the repetition of linked forms is deemed essential even now as it leads users through the movements necessary to transfer energy from the walking feet to the knees, hips, shoulders, elbows and finally the hands.Thus, while the fighter's null point power alone may be weaker than that of novices in other strength-based schools, infusing a standalone blow with the energy travelling through the External Harmonies will create an excess of force. When facing opponents of a similar level, the student may use this disparity to his or her advantage, surprising their adversary with an unanticipated level of power in order to press the attack.	4	5	h	Ten Ka Hitotsu / Han Ippo (First Under Heaven / Half Step)The basis of the style's footwork is to close the distance as quickly as possible with an economy of movement. This can be achieved with an abrupt shuffle forward into the opponent's range of attack or, ideally, past their defenses altogether. It's a simple method where the user can also follow an opponent as if they were their shadow.Juuji Gyakushuu (Cross Counterattack)With this technique for simultaneous defensive to offensive measures, the Ekitai practitioner can intercept an incoming physical strike by blocking with the back of their leading hand. Stepping in, the user then twists their lead hand to dissolve and deflect the attack downward. This leaves the opponent off balance with their upper body exposed to potential chains of other attacks.Kobokushi (Palm Strike)A variation on the punch, and the style's most basic attack, it utilises a 'soft' palm rather than the fist's 'hard' knuckles. This broader surface area transfers the force of the blow further across the area of impact and into the opponent, amplifying the chance of a knock-back rather than focusing on damaging a specific point.		3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
912	2	2	Fluid Fist	Ekitai-Kenfu	The edge of knowledge - that is the beginning of understanding.'By the second stage, the novice has learned how to hold their own in a confrontation, their precision and sense of timing more attuned to the flow of combat than those in other schools, even if their bodies are not. The mind is sharper, and the student can be taught how to select areas of their opponent to exploit as well as how to shave milliseconds off reaction times. A greater emphasis is also placed on the defending hand, in order to better deflect and redirect incoming attacks.Conditioning exercises now focus on the upper body in order to bring punches more in line with the speed and power of kicks. Knuckles become noticeably harder, stinging hand strikes now capable of leaving bruises, but the legs have also developed. Students have grown more familiar with the practice of shifting their weight while in motion, allowing them to more readily incorporate kicks into hand combinations and expand their range of movement.Instead of a simple straight kick to the shin or stomach, the student will experiment with ways of crippling the opposition, such as kicks to the inside of the knee, crotch or even shoulder, depending on their flexibility at close range. Indeed, many a student will want to use their newfound mobility as a means of invading their opponent's range as soon as possible, and might develop an over-reliance on techniques like Han Ippo. Instructors would advise against such overconfidence; it breeds over-thinking.Deliberation is the undoing of relaxation, a comparative state that the student must eventually achieve if they are to empty their mind, 'read the flow' and react naturally, particularly in the event that they must defend themselves. With continued practice of walking forms, as well as frequent sparring, the student will begin to internalise their understanding of range and timing, while flexibility training will be amplified to give the student a greater range of defensive movement on the spot.	4	5	h	Ten Ka Futatsu / Gen'ei Ippo (Second Under Heaven / Phantom Step)A foundational technique upon which the Ekitai-Kenfu is built, the Phantom Step is so named for two reasons: the first is the optical distortion of the body achieved through sheer fluidity of motion (where the user's appearance constantly flickers like a hologram), while the second is the complete lack of sound made by the user's footsteps. Combined, these characteristics make it difficult for opponents to read incoming attacks, let alone anticipate them.Kensei (Feint)The practitioner creates the illusion of danger with a convincing strike, although this is merely a distraction. In the same breath that the opponent reacts to the limb in question, which will intentionally fall short, the user retracts it sharply, immediately replacing it with a genuine strike from another direction, a shift in tactics so sudden that it should catch the opponent off guard.Zesshou Kobokushi (Lunging Palm Strike)This is a palm strike executed while performing a quick lunge. The user dives at the opponent with both their leading palm and foot outstretched, lowering their stance and gaining speed. The force of the impact is therefore stronger than a normal Palm Strike and can cause the opponent to stumble backward if hit.	Control-4, Power-4Ten Ka Mittsu / Gen'ei Setsu Ippo (Third Under Heaven / Phantom Interception Step)Special Requirement: Can only be activated after practitioner is struck by a Taijutsu or Ninjutsu technique.'Moving, be like water. Still, be like a mirror. Respond, like an echo.'The Phantom Interception Step is a hair-triggered cross-counter technique thrown immediately after engaging an opponent's close ranged strike in order to exploit the sudden opening in their position. After being struck, a subtle glint appears in the practitioner's eye that signifies the execution of the step. The Ekitai user will immediately disperse in a sudden burst of speed, and by fluctuating their velocity combined by the momentum gained by the opponent's attack, the user can counter by maneuvering their response - whether it be simple palm or elbow strike - to attack the opponent's blind spot. The counter can arrive at any angle, seemingly at the same time the user was struck.Stage 3: When the practitioner disperses, a single after image is left, allowing them to maneuver behind the opponent.Stage 4: The technique can be used in junction with an additional special technique (for an extra Jutsu cost)	6	8	0	0	0	0	0	6	0
912	3	3	Fluid Fist	Ekitai-Kenfu	The closer to the true way of Ekitai-Kenfu, the less wastage of expression there is.'Only by 'containing' the external with the internal, and surrendering to an almost intuitive level of perception, can the student hope to properly master the Ekitai-Kenfu's basic steps and linked forms. However, they will then gain access to the second kata -- one that, with hands closed, opens new avenues through which to develop into a fully functional fighter.The user is now comfortable in their body, able to gather harmonising energy from any position. Their quickness of movement has drastically increased, likened to a whip snapping against a rock. Sharp bursts of speed directed through the feet will result in a more mobile martial artist, whose linear running stance has assumed a compact and aerodynamic form. The most drastic improvement, however, comes in the speed of their hands, which are now capable of moving fluidly in almost any direction.This is joined by a heightened ability to intercept incoming attacks with the full extent of the arms; turning blows aside with a greater range of motion that can open up both the opponent's front and back to reversals. By sparring more frequently with their Ekitai-Kenfu sensei, the student will have begun to explore advanced Push Hands methodology, gaining improved confidence and control in coordinating the forearms and elbows for dynamic entrapments and cross counterattacks.As a typically grounded fighter, the student will learn to adopt the 'Te Tazuneru' or 'Asking Hand' pose in order to better deflect overhead strikes, as well as lifting their leading foot to block some of the opponent's kicks. What their arms have gained in speed, their legs have gained in stability, and being able to attack and defend with both upper and lower body will significantly aid the student in recouping a lost advantage, allowing them to return with longer and more unpredictable combinations.	4	5	h	Ten Ka Yottsu / Hosoku Ippo (Fourth Under Heaven / Capture Step)Should the user come up against an opponent who remains beyond the proximity required for offensive counterattacks, they might employ the Capture Step, the first technique they will learn to actively draw the opponent into their field of decimation. Following a counter or a guard break, the adept will use both hands to grab their foe's forearms or wrists for a fierce tug that has the power to bring the enemy stumbling into range or, failing that, interrupt their attempt at evasion.Juuji Gyakushuu: Tetsu Zankou (Cross Counter Attack: Shoulder Charge)Before engaging the opponent's strike, the user quickly steps in, lowering their stance significantly to dip under the attack before parrying. Shifting their legs in a fluid rotation, followed by their torso and arms, the user picks up momentum, batting the opponent's arms out of the way as they turn their back to them. Then, in one quick burst, the user lifts themselves, ramming their back into their adversary's chest to either send them skywards, stumbling or sprawling.Juuji Gyakushuu: Te Tazuneru (Cross Counter Attack: Asking Hand)Should their opponent lead with an overhead strike, the user will raise their matching arm, deflecting the blow down its outer length until the opponent's has slid to just below their elbow. By stepping in and forcing this elbow down, the user will add to their adversary's momentum in order to place them off balance. The practitioner can then grab the back of their opponent's neck with their free hand and deliver a sharp elbow to the upper spine with their former blocking arm.	Control-7, Power-7, Reserves-6Shin'irikugo / Kinryu-no-Mai (Heart & Mind, Six Harmonies / Golden Dragon Dance)The Golden Dragon Dance is a technique where the practitioner generates power from their entire body as a whole, focusing it into their striking limb in one explosive burst of economized strength. This sudden shockwave of wind disrupts the internal rhythm of the opponent's body, making it hard for them to breathe due to the erratic frenzy their heart goes into because of impact force/blunt trauma. This is also known as a Shocking Strike, utilized to stun the opponent for a brief moment (one post) as the practitioner continues their assault.Stage 4 (8 Trigram Wind Temple): The shockwave of wind, transferred from the user to opponent, can also damage anything directly behind the target, yielding the same effectStage 5 (17th Variation Piercing Mountain Wind): The generated wind is more grievous, holding the capability of piercing through iron with the softness of a gentle breeze, puncture wound the size of practitioner's fist	9	11	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
912	4	4	Fluid Fist	Ekitai-Kenfu	Adjust to the obstacle and you will find a way through it.'With practiced eyes, the Ekitai-fighter has grown proficient in detecting muscular interplay in their opponent's upper guard, now able to read most transitions between offence and defence. A distinct sure-footedness also facilitates longer combinations with both legs, affording them time to 'feel out' potential targets in their adversary's lower body. The longer the engagement, the sharper these insights become and the easier it will be for the adept to anticipate their enemy, even masters of the art.Although defending against such a foe is another matter, the user's movements have grown increasingly linear, allowing them to verily cut through the air with an economy of movement that improves stamina and reserves the body's energy for moments of contact. This means that they can also cover distance at greater speeds, and having found the most natural posture for their body to assume in combat, they are now able to move in more efficient and effective patterns.The Ekitai-fighter is now noted for the frequency of their interceptions and reversals, snapping back with rapid hand attacks aimed to overpower enemy defences through sheer force of number. These may also be linked with similarly relentless, multi-tiered foot combinations, supported by supple yet sturdy legs, conditioned to resist fatigue during both offence and defence whilst continuing to move through countless linked stances.Adding a new strategy to their arsenal, practitioners will now begin to chain disorientation techniques into their combos, aiming to cripple the opponent's balance with a mixture of open and closed hand strikes to ear, temple or jaw. Furthermore, heightened familiarity with their own body allows the user to test their agility more rigorously and creatively, and they will find that, due to improved reaction and execution times, acrobatic feats of evasion need no longer be restricted to the ground.	4	5	h	Ten Ka Itsutsu / Zan'ei Ippo (Fifth Under Heaven / Cutting Shadow Step)The successor of the Phantom Step, this is a technique where the user is capable of harmonizing their body to move with such fluidity that a single after image of the practitioner is created. An optical illusion achieved through swift movements, the image cannot move on its own nor can the user control it, as it appears as a still position. This tactic is often used to confuse an opponent so the practitioner can get into their blind spot to execute an attack.	Control-10, Power-10, Reserves-8Shin'irikugo / Ryu-sha-Sei (Heart & Mind, Six Harmonies / Dragon Chariot Star)The principle is to gather energy that reaches straight through the user, extending toward the opponent. By using the Golden Dragon Dance's principle of economizing strength into one explosive burst to transfer force from entire body to opponent, the Dragon Chariot Star means to transmit the practitioner's power through the air. This is achieved by collecting the atmospheric force harmonized in the practitioner's movement, whereas a shockwave of wind develops from the striking limb, barreling toward their adversary. When this is performed, it is as if the space between Ekitai-practitioner and target is nothing, allowing users to strike from a far range, acting as if the opponent were directly in front of them. The shockwave is quick and translucent, making it hard to deal with. This is also known as the Empty Palm technique. Initial impact is equal to half the user's strength without Taijutsu bonusesStage 5: Impact equal to the user's strength without Taijutsu bonusesStage 6: Impact equal to the user's strength, and includes Taijutsu bonuses	14	16	13	0	0	0	0	14	0
912	5	5	Fluid Fist	Ekitai-Kenfu	The only way to see the current in the river is to become the river itself.'The Stage Five practitioner's hard-won, intuitive grasp of the style's movements, their quick, discerning eye for spotting exploitable weaknesses, and their ability to execute countless attacks and counters with both power and precision have earned them a reputation as a force to be reckoned with. Now with open hands - fists unclenched, connecting harmonies relaxed and fluid - the adept has come into their own, understanding the art; becoming the art.Knuckles have become as hard as rock on the riverbed, propelled in unpredictable waves by limbs that are sleek and toned, quick and unyielding like the blade of a jian, but as mobile in their movement range as the lengths of a three section staff. Whether closed or open, hand strikes can be chained together faster than they have at any previous level, literally blurring the lines between student and master in the air before their eyes.Meanwhile, switching between combinations of the arms and legs has become an effortless, demise-dealing dance, as the user now possesses the ability to deliver an extreme amount of null point power to movements at a moment's notice. Their speed has also reached a new high, and whether running to gain distance, dodging with grounded or acrobatic flair, or simply recovering from a knockdown, the Ekitai-fighter is able to tap into their full velocity.Coupled with the results of their ongoing training to improve fluidity, spatial awareness and reaction times, the practitioner will now find themselves able to engage up to three opponents simultaneous, evading or defending attacks whilst feeling out the optimal means of removing each adversary from the equation as efficiently as possible.	4	5	h	Ten Ka Muttsu / Insho Ippo (Sixth Under Heaven / Hidden General Step)A variation technique based on a feint, it's an advanced method of combat designed to distract the opponent for a brief moment. When the Ekitai-practitioner snaps out at their adversary -whether fists or legs - they strike with the faÃƒÂ§ade of a dedicated attack. When the opponent's gaze is drawn to the false attack, the striking limb isn't retracted. Instead, the attack is flickered, snapped in a jerking motion that allows the course of the position of the strike to be altered. This allows for various high-speed and unorthodox strikes at various angles, so the user doesn't have to slow up their chain of attacks.	Control-15, Power-15, Reserves-13Ten Ka Nanatsu / Kage no Nai Ippo (Seventh Under Heaven / Shadowless Step)A technique rumored to avail assassins; the Shadowless Step is a chakra-enhanced motion that creates an active series of afterimages that may carry out a single action. The false image projected cannot mimic Ninjutsu, but can mimic a single physical action as a means to distract the opponent while the practitioner moves out of sight to attack from a blind spot. There is a total absence of noise during said movement, although wiser adversaries can hear the subtle varying cadence of steps utilized to achieve such fluid motion. Thus, although the Cutting Shadow Step is more a reactionary defensive afterimage tool used to catch opponents off guard, The Shadowless Step has more use as a means to create openings in an opponent's defense as a prelude to an offensive.	19	20	17	0	0	0	0	16	0
912	6	6	Fluid Fist	Ekitai-Kenfu	To put the heart of the Ekitai-Kenfu in your own heart and have it be a part of you means total comprehension and the use of a free style. When you have that you will know that there are no limits.'Although the adept is now innately familiar with their body's movements they are still bound to practice, train, spar and study, for they are on the cusp of mastering their art. At this crucial time, if they are not stepping forward they are falling behind.The fighter will sway slightly when moving or striking, forgoing all manner of stiffness and embracing the ever-flow. Like the cup that was first emptied and filled as a student, the warrior of the Six Harmonies can now be represented as a circle of six cups, each filling, pouring and refilling themselves in an endless cycle of fluidity. Quickness of execution and reaction time takes a noted leap, practitioners capably intercepting and/or redirecting incoming attacks with little additional effort.When striking with the hands, attacks are even more calculated and debilitating, while kicking effectiveness has been further refined, including power, accuracy and strategic placement. Legs are now moving instinctively to cripple the opponent by 'feeling out' weak spots in their form, guided by the same intent behind the arms, the external harmonies linked as a cohesive unit. This is reflected in evasive movements, which could be anything from minute weight transfers to advanced acrobatics.However, the aspect of growth most readily referenced (and feared) is the unrelenting manner in which the EK fighter will repeatedly step into their opponent's sphere of influence to pepper them with frenzied assault of swift, overpowering attacks. Even mid-flurry, they are quick enough to dodge, deflect or redirect most counterattacks without missing a beat.	4	5	h		Control-19, Power-19, Reserves-18Shin'irikugo / Issoku Itto no Mai: Shichi Ten Sho (Heart & Mind, Six Harmonies / Distance of One Step - One Strike: Seven Point Palm)At the earliest development of the Ekitai-Kenfu, it is said that a Dragon Hermit once dedicated their days to executing ten thousand punches of gratitude to the style. They would calm them self, worship, pray, ready their stance, and then punch. Upon accomplishing this phenomenal feat by completing said routine in under an hour, the Hermit discovered that their fists occupied a space quicker than sound itself. This is where this technique arrives.After clasping one's hands together in a fluid motion, serene in prayer, the practitioner harmonizes their being as a whole to produce a Shocking Strike so devastating that many Taijutsu artist are confounded by its power. The practitioner bursts forward to deliver a straight punch that divides the air around them in two, creating an absence of wind and silence. The strike itself yields a tremendous impact force that elicits a concussive shockwave that ripples through the opponent's body from the point of contact.The shockwave is an instantaneous wind explosion drawn out from thirteen specific points of the adversary's anatomy: The Seven Stars (the head, the shoulders, the elbows, the hands, the hips, the knees, and the feet). This is the true essence of the Ekitai-Kenfu's elegance and rhetoric, whereas bones can be fractured and muscles mangled if the technique isn't avoided. A space of one step, one strike: to incapacitate an opponent as quickly as possible. Note: *The user's senses are heightened; speed increases by two levels for a single post, but decreases by two afterward. **The strike emits a copious amount of excessive wind, so if avoided, the wind itself can push objects back two feet as a means to stall a counter attack	23	30	22	0	0	0	18	18	0
912	7	7	Fluid Fist	Ekitai-Kenfu	The river originates and finishes as one - a force of nature that is forever at both ends of time. So too is a master of the Fluid Fist. There is no true beginning, for they are already there. Incapacitating the enemy as quickly as possible, the end is just as immediate. And when time runs out, when the water is gone, though it will seem that they were never here, the path they have wrought will remain.'Only a master of the Ekitai-Kenfu is worthy of teaching disciples, for they have broken through the barrier of comprehension and become the essence and the totality of the art. Their insight over strength is absolute, as is their precision over power. Both the river and the river bed, they can seek out opponent vulnerabilities with deadly perception but also bear the brunt of most assaults, with incredible pain tolerance for the rare strike that will penetrate their field of parries, redirections and counterattacks. Hand movements have become so quick, fluid and exact that the user should be able to effortlessly pierce their opponent's defences, bombarding them with a storm of strikes, while holding enough control to counter nearly any reprise.They are able to gather the required zero point energy to do so at seemingly inhuman levels of speed and power. Enough, even, to shatter wooden beams, crack boulders and even dent steel, the knuckles of their hands and feet extremely hard, like diamonds, almost. Landing critical and decisive blows, there is no wastage of movement. Legs, too, have reached the stage where steps form as flawlessly as strikes. The velocity of kicks, in fact, is such that they can arise entirely unnoticed by an opponent until it is too late to react. With complete control over their impulses and an intuition that is equal parts foresight and insight, they will find that their hands and feet move almost of their own accord, chaining with and transitioning between each other in perfect unison.Decisions are now made several steps ahead of one's adversary. By developing the body to a point where flowing through each and every movement the style has become far more than any taught definition of the word 'Fluid', all action is fully innate and the mind is free, a river that can correct its own course. This realm of possibility and impossibility, the 'totality' and the 'void' as one, must be experienced to be fully understood - a state of bodily motion so like the water's invisible waves that only a doujutsu user would stand a chance of keeping up. The swaying the Ekitai-fighter's form, now perfectly attuned to offensive and defensive patterns, will also add further unpredictable undulation to each move through effortless weight transfers.This permits a master of the Seven Stars and Six Harmonies to deliver their body's full destructive force at a moment's notice.	4	5	h		Control-26, Power-25, Reserves-24Ogi: Rei Ippo / Ame no Ukihashi (Secret Technique: Zero Step / Floating Bridge of Heaven)Requirement: Shichi Ten Sho (Seven Point Palm)Special Requirement: Shichi Ten Sho is either blocked, or dodged'Even if you avoid the fangs of the Flying Dragon,the gusting winds strip away freedom of movementand the claws would rip you apart.'-The Dragon HermitThe secret technique of the Ekitai-Kenfu, one so rare that even the most seasoned practitioners of the style may not be aware of its inception. This was developed after the Dragon Hermit who had dedicated their days to ten thousand punches of gratitude had found flaw in the aftermath of the Shichi Ten Sho, for the immense strength behind the strike divided the air in two, but since wind is ever flowing, it'd rush back into the space and uproot the hermit moments after execution-misbalancing his center of gravity. This is where this technique arrives.Active only after the Shichi Ten Sho itself is blocked or dodged, the Ame no Ukihashi is a palm-shaped shockwave of atmospheric force harnessed by molding the rushing wind of its predecessor into a devastating counter attack. This is achieved through the once deflected air being drawn toward the practitioner's dormant hand like a vortex as they reach toward their intended target with a gentle open palm.To relate the atmospheric power behind the shockwave to that of a series of explosive notes would be frugal, for the amount of impact force behind the initial attack is dwarfed, affecting the opponent's body as a whole opposed to being centralized at the Seven Stars. This manifests a ten foot blast of air capable of tearing down trees and shredding through boulders, sending those in the wake of the palm barreling away in a cacophony of screeching wind harmonized to incapacitate even the most stunning warrior as urgently as possible. As such, this is the most profound ability of the Ekitai-Kenfu. Note: *Speed boost of Shichi Ten Sho is facilitated for an additional post, speed decreases by an additional level afterward (three in total) **The inexorable vortex of wind draws opponents who are three feet away ***Shockwave cuts through Stage Six Ninjutsu and lower	30	40	29	0	0	0	22	22	0
911	1	1	Vortex Fist 	Kadou Ken		4	5		Slap: Slapping someone is hardly accepted as a valid striking maneuver in most schools of fighting, but it is a very effective method of distracting and stunning the opponent. It takes little strength to deliver a stinging slap to the face, chest, arm, or anywhere else, and while not very damaging, it does tend to be painful. It's best used when closing in on the opponent, as a distraction to hide a more potent method of attack.Finger Flick: Much like the Slap, but more focused and more humiliating. Used with either one or two fingers, it is a useful way to distract a foe with an irritating stinging sensation. Moreover, because it requires little to no movement of the arm itself, it is also very usable after parrying an attack, and is adept at making some opponents flinch.Punch: In the Kadou-Ken style of fighting, punches are meant to be quick and repeated, not as a power attack to cause immense damage in one blow. Often, they are thrown in succession, aimed at head, chest, and gut. Kick: Kicks are not very important, but do tend to be useful in certain situations. Generally, it's expected that you don't kick too often or too high, and instead use it from the air, or in situations where range is more important than safety and speed. Other types of kicks are focused on later, especially to sweep and to launch opponents upward.Weapon Grab: If the opponent has the audacity to swing a non-bladed weapon at you, this skill would be to catch the weapon. However, care must be taken that the bones in the hands are not crushed upon impact, making sure to move the hands with the momentum of the weapon, minimizing impact. This not only gives you a measure of control over the opponent, but makes it much more difficult for them to attack you.		0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
911	2	2	Vortex Fist 	Kadou Ken		4	5		Elbow: Elbows are hard, knobby bones that are good for resting on tables, and for slamming into people. The latter use is very effective at close ranges, and tends to hurt the user less, and the opponent more, than a regular bunch would. The range is rather low, however, making it much less useful as a closing attack.Shoulder: Much like elbows, yet with less range, making them suitable for encounters of the very, very close kind. Combined with parries or grabs, it can be an effective method of attack in charges, particularly if your hands are otherwise occupied.Palm: Striking with the heel of the hand(as opposed to the foot) is both damaging and safe. In addition to this method, the palm of the hand is great for grabbing things, whether it be clothing, earlobes, or the opponent's entire face. One can either push or pull with this weapon, allowing more manipulation of the opponent's balance.Knee: Much like elbows, knees are hard objects that are also good for both kneeling, and hitting people. Excellent targets are the gut, crotch, and rarely the head. Also perfect for close ranges, when an actual kick is impossible to preform.Blade Grab: Effective against, you guessed it, bladed weapons, this skill is a difficult maneuver designed to stop a weapon with your bare hands. Dangerous, rarely does the user get out without a scratch, but if it's that or having a limb or (heaven forbid) your head lopped off, I'd rather take a minor slice on the hand. Those who have mastered the 5th or 6th level of this style often have the skill to do this uninjured, at which time it becomes a effective tool against blademasters.Basic Throw: A basic, over-the-shoulder throw, the general direction desired is not horizontal, but vertical, which is to say, straight down. Of course, if there is a nearby wall or some such, more force is applied, often resulting in a collision with a hard vertical surface. The basic method is to grab the arm of the opponent with one hand, following which the user places the other under the armpit, and turns their back towards the opponent. Using the hip, they lift and throw the opponent over their shoulder in one smooth motion. All of this must be done quickly, of course, and is best followed up with a powerful strike of some kind. There are many other types of throws that are learned as well, but due to laziness, I'll leave the execution of these attack to your discretion.	Kuuhaku Douryou Atemi [Null Momentum Strike]Focusing chakra in the attacking area, the user will force the, uh, force of the blow through the opponent. The desired result is to damage to opponent, but disperse the momentum of the attack, resulting in a net zero movement of the opponent. In this way, the user can keep the opponent from flying away, even with the most powerful attacks, allowing quicker, easier follow-ups. At stage three, this attack can also damage anything directly behind the target, and at stage four, it is possible to completely negate any damage done by your own attack to the original target, passing it through to the object directly behind.	0	9	5	0	0	0	0	6	0
911	3	3	Vortex Fist 	Kadou Ken		4	5		Hand Chop: Yet another way to attack with the heel of the hand, this one is less like a punch, and more like a club. Its greatest applications are attempting to render a foe unconscious, or strikes at the elbows/knees and neck.Backhand Blow: Much like the slap, yet backwards! Generally, it's power and not distraction that are the goal here, plus is generally looks badass to slap someone backwards.Foot Displacement: A difficult and often painful technique, the goal is to place your foot under the opponent's, usually in mid-step, and thus unbalance them. It can be quite effective, if you can put up with a little pain, or the opponent is rather lightweight. Another, similar, yet less painful, way is to slide the foot directly into the offending foot, also knocking the foe off-balance. The main difference is the situation it can be used in.Basic Foot Sweep: The point of this altered kick is to attack the feet, with the end goal of which is to knock them over. There are various ways to go about this, from hooking the foot behind the leg to upset balance, or a spinning sweep to completely knock a person off their feet.Basic Arm Lock: The arm lock is a hold that forces the arm into a straight position by exerting force in the opposite direction of the natural joint movement. By accomplishing this, one can cause enough pain to often force the opponent into physical compliance. When doing this, it is often used for throws, and enough pressure on the arm can cause bone to break and ligaments to tear.	Shunkoku Kyoten Teiryuu [Instant Point Stop]Often, as the user rushes at the opponent, momentum may become a hindrance, rather than a help. This technique first and foremost allows the user to 'stop on a dime', so to speak. This instant stop is accomplished by using chakra both to latch on to the ground, but more importantly, shed the momentum of movement near-instantly. The more experienced the user, the faster and easier it is to stop. While a Genin might take half a foot to stop from a full sprint, a Jounin could do so with-in millimeters, and with little discomfort.However, that is only the beginning of the technique. Using chakra, all the momentum of movement is gathered and focused into one area, usually a hand or foot, which is then transferred in a strike. This greatly increases the force of the blow, though how much it increases is directly related to how fast the user was moving before the stop, and how experienced the user is.	0	12	8	0	0	0	0	8	0
911	4	4	Vortex Fist 	Kadou Ken		4	5		Basic Launching: The act of causing the foe to rise vertically against their will. In this school of fighting, this is most often accomplished with powerful throws, or powerful kicks. Punches are much less likely in this style, though an enterprising shinobi might find it more unpredictable or effective to use this method. After sent airborne, generally you don't let them escape. One nice point about airborne enemies, is that most of them have extremely limited movement options until they encounter another hard surface.Weapon Disarming: The act of relieving an opponent of their weapon is not an easy one, by any means. To most foes, the weapon is the only thing they are truly capable of fighting with, and the loss of it is almost an assured victory for you. Ways to accomplish this include, but are not limited to, striking the hands, striking the weapon, or wrestling it out of their grasp. Most skilled shinobi can even turn this disarming procedure into a simultaneous attack.	Douryou Shousan [Momentum Dispersion]A purely defensive technique, the user will concentrate chakra into one or both hands(or occasionally a foot), and use that energy to 'disperse' an object's momentum. The difficulty of this is directly related to the mass and power behind the object, and how many hands are used to stop it, and the user's proficiency at this is measured by the control stat. At 10, you might be able to negate enough momentum to stop a hundred pound weight thrown by another ninja with your own strength, but at 40, you'd be able to stop almost anything. This applies only to physical objects such as people, rocks, etc. Nor is this some kind of absolute defense, because the object must be stopped with the hands(or feet). Also, if this object is being constantly propelled by some kind of force, it is not only harder to stop, but stopping it lasts for mere seconds.	12	17	14	0	0	0	0	14	0
911	5	5	Vortex Fist 	Kadou Ken		4	5		Kage Buyou [Shadow Dance]: Oft encountered in various countries under various names, this is the 'simple' movement of following an opponent as if you were their shadow. This is best used after a heavy 'knock-back' blow of some kind, in order to continue a combo of attacks.	Gekizou Heikouidou [Sudden Increase Shift]This technique is used to give the illusion of a massive speed increase. What this technique does is utilize chakra to induce an instant acceleration to top speed. While surprising, the main use of this technique is to trick the opponent's eyes. While not useful against most Doujutsu bloodlines, normal human eyes will tend to relax if the object they are viewing does not move quickly. Thus, a very sudden acceleration can make the user seem to disappear from vision for several vital seconds, a type of optical illusion. This does not work if the opponent is faster than you, at least not as intended. It can still be surprising, however.If the opponent's speed is equal to the user's, they can 'catch up' with the movement in about one meter of movement. Surprising, certainly. If five points slower, the effective range is increased to three meters, and if it is greater than ten, the effective range is however far the user can cover in a single post.	17	20	19	0	0	0	0	16	0
911	6	6	Vortex Fist 	Kadou Ken		4	5		Weapon Destruction: As an 'anti-weapon' shinobi, this is the peak of ability. It is the skill to apply the right amount of force in the right area of the weapon, to crack, snap, or shatter all but the most well made weapons. Naturally, this requires OOC permission for the weapon to actually break, and is probably much less useful when used on 'unbreakable' weapons.	Ninpou: Saidai Kadou Naihatsu [Ninja Art: Maximum Vortex Energy Burst]A powerful striking technique, it is used in two variations. The goal of the technique is to use chakra and a bit of momentum to greatly increase the force of the blow. The first method of preforming it follows a precise method of movements. The user must make at least a 270 degree rotation of the body as they gather chakra into the hands, followed by a 180 degree rotation of the arms as the hands are brought up and forward in a double-palm thrust. At this point, all the chakra is released, greatly enhancing the strength of the blow. It can be used a number of times equal to the user's reserves divided by 5, but after the first use, it is generally rather easy to spot coming. Which is only made easier when you take into account that the amount of gathered chakra is usually distinguishable to an experienced ninja as a type of glow around the limbs in question, although it's not enough to truly be seen by the naked eye. This version has speed on its side, though not versatility.Alternately, a simpler, but longer, way is to take a few seconds(one post) to gather a large amount amount of chakra into a limb or limbs, and unleash it on the next post. It should be noted that this strength is not a muscular strength increase, merely a damage output increase.Either way, the force of this blow is incredible, and few can withstand its awesome power.	23	27	25	0	0	0	18	18	0
911	7	7	Vortex Fist 	Kadou Ken	Regular Techniques: By this point, anything I could spell out would be far too rigid for a true master of this style, one who is capable of coming up with or combining multiple elements of this style into fluid moves and lethal strikes. Indeed, true mastery of this style is seen with the creation of a single special technique that has the user's own personal flavor.	4	5				31	35	33	0	0	0	22	22	0
910	1	1	Precision Fist	Seido Kobushi		3	h	h	ExplosionDescription: By concentrating a large amount of chakra into his/her fist/foot, the user then throws the fist at a target. At the precise moment the fist lands on the target, the user then releases all the pent up chakra energy, which is converted into an explosive force that can knock back unsuspecting opponents.		0	0	0	0	0	0	3	5	0
910	2	2	Precision Fist	Seido Kobushi		3	h	h	ExplosionDescription: By concentrating a large amount of chakra into his/her fist/foot, the user then throws the fist/foot at a target. At the precise moment the fist/foot lands on the target, the user then releases all the pent up chakra energy, which is converted into an explosive force that can knock back opponents a couple feet.	TransferDescription: Explosion isn't just limited to feet or fists. Explosion can be transferred to weapons as well! Simply put, any weapon that is hand-held, not being used as a projectile, and has no special properties can be used as a channel to Explosion. This is normally done on the tip, edge, or side of the weapon. The user can use the Explosion that is one stage lower then where he is currently at, meaning if he has Stage Five of Precision Fist, then his weapon can be have Transfer at Stage Four.	6	0	0	0	0	0	6	8	0
910	3	3	Precision Fist	Seido Kobushi		3	h	h	ExplosionDescription: By concentrating a large amount of chakra into his/her fist/foot, the user then throws the fist/foot at a target. At the precise moment the fist/foot lands on the target, the user then releases all the pent up chakra energy, which is converted into an explosive force that can knock down opponents. The attack can hit through defensive jutsu that are Stage 1.	SpikeDescription: The user concentrates chakra into his/her hand/foot. Then, instead of concentrating a large amount to create an explosion, the user hardens the chakra within the hand/foot and then sharpens the hardened chakra. This essentially turns the hand or foot into a spike, even though the hand/foot still looks exactly the same. This is then basically used to stab the hell out of people. The technique lasts for a single post. The hand/foot has the same strength and durability as a metal spike, and if they were ever to be broken, then the user would require healing immediately or have a useless hand or foot for the remainder of the thread.	8	0	0	0	0	0	8	12	0
910	4	4	Precision Fist	Seido Kobushi		3	h	h	ExplosionDescription: By concentrating a large amount of chakra into his/her fist/foot, the user then throws the fist/foot at a target. At the precise moment the fist/foot lands on the target, the user then releases all the pent up chakra energy, which is converted into an explosive force that can knock out opponents for a few moments (1 post). The attack can hit through defensive jutsu that are Stage 2.	GripDescription: The user is now familiar enough with Precision Fist to manipulate his chakra in a more exotic fashion. To initiate this technique, the user grabs the opponent, whether it is an arm, leg, neck, or even head. Then, chakra is concentrated into the palm and fingers of the user. Instantly, there is an explosion, but instead of the widespread destructive force of Explosion, this is a much more concentrated and controlled explosion. Basically a mini-explosion, the attack is enough to blast away chunks of flesh from an opponent. This attack is useless against armor and elemental defenses, and will only singe such defenses. However, it can be positively lethal if used correctly. This is done over two posts. The first post is the actual gripping, and then the second post is the explosion.	14	0	0	0	0	0	14	17	12
910	5	5	Precision Fist	Seido Kobushi		3	h	h	ExplosionDescription: By concentrating a large amount of chakra into his/her fist/foot, the user then throws the fist/foot at a target. At the precise moment the fist/foot lands on the target, the user then releases all the pent up chakra energy, which is converted into an explosive force that can knock out opponents (for rest of thread). Opponent permission required. The attack can hit through defensive jutsu that are Stage 3.	Full Body ExplosionDescription: Due to the fact that the style has little to no defensive moves at all, one practitioner decided that it would be a good idea to come up with a technique that could repel attacks. He was partially successful, for this Full Body Explosion could repel attacks, sort of. Basically, by concentrating chakra throughout his body, the user can cause an explosion that surrounds his entire body the moment something touches his body, whether it is a punch or a friendly kiss. The Full Body Explosion has the same force as a Stage Four Explosion. While the user has the chakra concentrated and is using Full Body Explosion, no other techniques from this style can be used. The chakra also has to be released once the technique is initiated, meaning that it cannot be canceled.	16	0	0	0	0	0	18	22	16

At the precise moment the fist/foot lands on the target, the user then releases all the pent up chakra energy, which is converted into an explosive force that can kill unsuspecting opponents. Opponent permission required. The attack can hit through defensive jutsu that are Stage 4.	HardenDescription: Sometimes, the best defense is a perfect offense. But to have a perfect offense, it would mean being a tank, a person who can keep walking forward regardless of anything that is happening around him. Nothing can stop him. The user takes his chakra and concentrates all of within his chest. This chakra then enters his bloodstream, quickly moving through all veins and arteries, powering up the very muscles and bones of the user. The user becomes a veritable tank, a machine that can walk forward and ignore all damage. However, there are a series of drawbacks to this powerful technique. First off, only one technique of this style can be used while the user is using Harden. Second, as soon as Harden finishes, all damage taken by the user instantly hits him and doubles as well. Finally, the user cannot use any other technique outside of this style, whether it is a jutsu or a taijutsu move. Harden lasts for three posts and can only be used once a thread.	18	18	0	0	0	0	25	30	20
910	7	7	Precision Fist	Seido Kobushi		3	h	h	ExplosionDescription: By concentrating a large amount of chakra into his/her fist/foot, the user then throws the fist/foot at a target. At the precise moment the fist/foot lands on the target, the user then releases all the pent up chakra energy, which is converted into an explosive force that can kill multiple opponents. Opponent permission required. The attack can hit through defensive jutsu that are Stage 5.	Inner ExplosionDescription: While it's a fun idea to be flashy with one's Explosions, sometimes it is just as good to be subtle as well. Using a supreme mastery of one's chakra, the user concentrates it all into a single fingertip. This massive amount of chakra is then transferred over to an opponent with a single touch of said fingertip, usually on the forehead, although any body part would do as long as skin is touched. The chakra instantly flows into the opponent's body, instantly igniting the chakra within the victim himself. A few moments later, the opponent explodes. Opponent permission is required.	22	22	0	0	0	0	32	35	32
909	1	1	Pi Qua Quan 	None	At this stage the user can strike slighter stronger than an untrained Shinobi; a solid hit causes minor pain and possibly bruising but not much more than that. Movements are awkward at this stage, lacking the fluid motion that masters of Pi Qua Quan possess. The user is still unsure of his stance and moves with a bit of difficulty, making each strike rough and slow. Arm movements are difficult to control as the user hasn't learned to keep his arms properly relaxed, and have a tendency to form his hands into fists, which slow down their movements.Having just begun training their arms and legs to be flexible, they are slightly more flexible than the average Taijutsu user, though not by a lot. Their reflexes are on par with any other Shinobi, granting them no real advantage at this stage.	4	5	h	Seiryu-KashoA simple move done will facing away from the opponent. When the opponent is close. The user begins the move by starting to spin on one foot while at the same time swinging their arms downward in front of them, using the momentum from the spin to bring their arms up such that their hands strike the opponent typically below the chin making for a strong blow that is difficult to defend against.PiThe main kind of strike in the style, Pi takes the higher hand and uses it to strike, angled downwards. By itself it may be weak, but later it is coupled with consecutive strikes for a combo effect.		4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
909	2	2	Pi Qua Quan 	None	Movements are a bit more sophisticated, the user now able to perform the up and down movements of Pi Qua Quan with greater accuracy and speed. The motions are still stiff however when compared to a master of this style. At this stage the user is showing greater levels of flexibility, now able to bend backwards to a greater extent than normal, useful for dodging some attacks.Regular Techniques	2	5	2	FukanroDescription: Catching the opponents kick, the user holds it high while bending down low to quickly grab the opponents other foot, and in one swift movement they wrench the opponents other foot up high while pushing the other down low, the movement typically taking the opponent clear off the ground, causing them to spin in mid air before collapsing on the ground. Though this counter is not particularly damaging, it can provide an opening for additional attacks, making it quite useful in the right hands.Teishitsu-Jouhai-ShoA move performed while the user is facing the enemy. Bending down slightly, the user executes a perfect 360 degree spin, striking upwards as they do so resulting in a powerful uppercut that at higher levels can easily lift an opponent off the ground.QuaQua is the step to follow Pi. Using the lower hand, the student strikes at an upward angle to hit the exact same spot that Pi did for increased pain.		6	8	0	0	0	0	0	6	0
909	3	3	Pi Qua Quan 	None	At this stage the users hands, held fairly loose can be used to break wooden panels without significant difficulty, making them rather more formidable at this stage. Movements are less rigid than in the previous stage, as the user is beginning to learn how to make each move flow more into the other. Additionally they are more adept at keeping their arms relaxed, allowing them to whip them around with greater accuracy and speed. Having practiced more advanced forms of stretching, the user is flexible enough to allow their body to twist and bend into the moves more easily; the user has no problem holding a crouch or other such positions for hours at a time without their legs cramping.Only now does the users reflex training start to pay off. Though the difference is only slight, it is enough to allow them to move to lessen the impact of blows that would have otherwise been quite harmful, or dodge blows that would have only just previously found purchase.	2	5	2	Kasui-ShoWhen an opponent attempts to kick the user while in their Bokuho stance, the user slides extended leg forward while crossing their arms over their head to defend against the kick. With the opponents leg pressed against their arms, the users then swiftly pushes themselves upward forcing the opponents leg high upwards and sweeps their other foot through the opponents other leg, causing them to fall onto their back or neck. This is typically followed with a sharp kick to a vital area and can be devastating against ill prepared opponents.QuanFinally, the last technique in the 'Pi Qua Quan' basic chain, Quan takes the hand that originally used Pi, but thrusts directly forwards at the spot struck by both Pi and Quan (or somewhere near Qua if Pi and Qua were in different locations).		8	12	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
909	4	4	Pi Qua Quan 	None	With the users continued focus, their attacks now pack quite the 'punch'. As such, combined with their speed at this stage they are becoming very dangerous to face. The serpent-like form of the arm becomes more pronounced, though the user doesn't have quite enough skill to move around nearly as fast or fluidly as higher stages. Attacks have rid themselves of the (up until this point) characteristic sluggishness and unwieldiness. Furthermore, at this stage the user's flexibility and agility allows them to duck in and out of a slower opponent's blows, bending their bodies to dodge attacks. While this is extremely handy against Taijutsu users that specialize in slow, powerful moves, faster opponents still prove to be a problem.The user is showing real improvement in their reflexes, such that they are now not only better able to dodge attacks, but they are now more often able to catch and block direct attacks, a particularly important part of the style.	2	5	2	Tenshin-BansaA deceptively simple counter in which the user catches the opponents punch with both hands, then pulling the opponent forward and turning such that they are behind the opponent, the user then leans forward, forcing the opponent to the ground, while still holding onto their arm, typically resulting in the arm breaking or being dislocated at least.KoranAnother quite simple but powerful move. Quickly catching an opponents kick, the user immediately lashes out with a kick of their own to the opponents groin, and stepping forward as they do that, they finish it off with a kick to the opponents other foot, typically leaving them face down on the ground struggling to stand.Pi QuaThis is a simple chain technique, linking together the basics of Pi and Qua. The higher hand strikes downwards with the lower hand striking upwards almost immediately after to hit the exact same spot.	Hebi no SuWhile this is more of a technique to disorient as much as it is to damage, it is nevertheless extremely useful in tight spots where the student needs to gain some breathing space. Using a burst of Chakra, the user launches a veritable flurry of sharp jabs, so fierce it appears as if a cloud of hands are attacking the opponent. Three strikes can be made for every stage of Pi Qua Quan the user has learned and each strike leaves an after-image to further confuse the opponent.	12	20	11	0	0	0	0	14	0
909	5	5	Pi Qua Quan 	None	At this stage a single solid strike from the user can leave an enemy aching for days, with vicious bruises all over the body. The elegant fluidity of the style is beginning to become apparent at this point. Stiffness is no longer an issue, as the student has become more conscious of relaxing his arms and hands properly. Attacks are performed much quicker and flow together better, no longer suffering from either hesitation or awkwardness.Now having quite an exceptional degree of balance as well as flexibility, the user is now adept at keeping their positions whilst trying to move the opponent off of theirs. The user's ability to weave through an opponent's attacks is improved at this point.The practitioner's reflexes are now at a stage where striking them seems an exercise in futility. Only very carefully planned combinations of attacks, or attacks by multiple people will have much chance of striking.	4	5	h	Uryu-BandaOne of Pi Qua Quan's signature moves, it is essentially a very fast spin in which both the users body and their arms spin rapidly, though their arms are focused in one direction making them appear much like the sails on a windmill. The speed and fluidity of this move is easily the most impressive part, and due to the swiftness with which the move can be started it is a very dangerous move to anyone foolish enough to get too close. Lastly the move provides an ideal opportunity to move into the Bokuho stance, allowing the user to press the offensive further afterwards.Pi QuanSkipping the Qua, Pi Quan starts with the higher hand striking downwards and the lower hand thrusting straight out, both targeting the same location for greater inflicted agony.	Hebi DokuekiGathering Chakra to their fingertips, the student begins to shoot pulses of Chakra whenever he lands a hit to aggravate the target's muscles. It becomes increasingly painful and annoying for the opponent to move that muscle the more the user hits it with Snake Venom; once the same muscle has been hit five times in one thread, the muscle cramps (doing this to the heart induces cardiac arrest, not instant death). Snake Venom can be maintained one post for every stage of Pi Qua Quan the user has learned and requires three posts of cooldown before it can be activated again.	16	25	15	0	0	0	0	16	0
909	6	6	Pi Qua Quan 	None	At this stage a solid strike can dent, sometimes crack a tree, naturally making their attacks against an unarmoured opponent very punishing. The student's movements take on a more graceful appearance with each move, as the technique now becomes almost second nature. The arms are for the most part properly relaxed, though the user still has a tendency to move a bit more rigidly than a true master of this style. Lower level Shinobi may find their movements difficult to anticipate and counter due to their speed and focused nature.Now able to bend their bodies in ways most normal people can't even imagine, Shinobi of this level are almost more of a gymnast than a Taijutsu user. Not only can they weave through slow opponents attacks relatively easy, but they can often find ways to sweep the opponent off their feet while keeping their own easily.	2	5	2	Qua QuanYet another simple chain, Qua Quan starts with the lower hand striking upwards, and the higher hand thrusting directly. Qua Quan is merely the inverse of Pi Quan, but is actually harder in execution because of the lower start off point.	Hebinoyou KuufukuThe first and foremost vicious technique of Pi Qua Quan, the student channels an enormous amount of Chakra into his entire hand. With the next strike, the pent up Chakra will then be released outwards. If this were to hit a solid object, it would produce such a potent force the user's hand would break the surface of the object and dig into the core. Obviously against a human, this technique can prove to be quite deadly.	23	32	20	0	0	0	16	20	0
909	7	7	Pi Qua Quan 	None	Attacks are to be feared, known to even drive long cracks into tree trunks and cause boulders to divide. Enough hits on a human being could be disastrous for the hapless fool of a victim who decided to fight a master of Pi Qua Quan. The fluidity of the style is now at its peak; all moves are performed quickly and easily without hesitation, making the user's hand and leg movements appear as a blur to the enemy. Each move of the hand or leg melds completely in with the next, making it quite a spectacle to watch.By this stage there is virtually no position the user cannot perform, their flexibility having advanced to almost superhuman levels. Their balance is exceptional; knocking them off their feet is extremely difficult as they can stay standing still with no problems even while the earth shakes violently under their feet. Against a slow opponent, the user can pretty much bend and twist their body around their attacks and strike the heart of the enemy with ease.	4	5	h	Pi Qua QuanThe three are finally linked together in their entirety. In a blaze of attacks, the master strikes with the full force of Pi Qua Quan; the higher hand snakes downwards, the lower hand slithers upwards, and the higher hand lunges forwards to finish it off.	Hebi SougikouiCharging an enormous quantity of Chakra into a single hand and the rest of the arm, the student's next strike will carry a ferocious amount of thrust behind it. It will be able to pierce through anything, whether it be a physical defense (including 'indestructible' properties) or a Ninjutsu defense (up to and including Stage Six). Only the tantamount power of the gods can hope to stop the Snake Strike.	31	38	30	0	0	0	20	24	0
908	1	1	Razor Vine Sword Style	None	Whip Formation: Length of the whip portion of the sword begins at the actual length of the sword plus an additional foot and further training is required for any additional control over the sword in whip form.Control: At this stage the shinobi has merely learned how to recall the whip. This is done by curling up the whip so that when it is swung, it will fling out again.	4	5	h			0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

The thrust is an immediate attack and the whip recoils immediately afterward. The whip crack may now shatter wooden boards.	4	5	h			0	8	6	0	0	0	0	6	0

907	1	1	Right Season Worker's Glove	None	Physical Attack Diversity: At this level a Right Season Worker is barely applying the physical combat aspect of the style, as such his close-range game is never very impressive-looking and keeps his attacks very straightforward and almost to text-book perfection.Evasive Manuvering: Blocking, blocking, and more blocking at Stage 1 a Right Season Worker is generally told to put more emphasis to blocking his attack and less on actually evading it. While this generally tires the practicioner quickly it makes him smarter in the sense that he is slowly learning where attacks come from. As such it gives him a foundation to learn how to evade in later stages.Weapon Capability: Most likely not very impressive, generally the weapon capability of the glove right now is more or less a tool that could be found anywhere. If one were to look at the practicioner's weapon they would see it as horribly cumbersome for the specific tool installed on the weapon.	3	2	4	Jab: More or less a straight and quick punch to either the head or body. Right Season Workers are generally trained to aim for the nose/mouth area as a broken nose or tooth can quickly cause a distraction in the middle of a fight.Hook: A curved punch thatis generally swung by the shoulders, generally aimed for the cheek or side. However Right Season Workers are trained quickly that a well placed Hook to the ear or even the temple can make someone's day a hell of a lot worse.Buffalo Knuckle: More or less a straight jab, however the middle finger is jutted out a little farther then the rest of the fingers. This attack is generally aimed for right between the eyes, if it hits generally there's a moment of confusion for the opponent while he attempt to recollect himself.Shoulder Ram: A move that is generally used when the opponent is trying to change the momentum of a fight by using a huge, hard hitting move. Using the shoulder ram one can bring themselves in the closest range possible, interrupt the opponents attack, and hopefully maintain the momentum of the fight.	Requirements: Power 2, Reserves 2Foot Trap: Considered more of a "Dirty Move" then anything else, which more likely then explains why it is a stage 1 technique. Sending as much chakra as possible to one's foot the fighter stomps on his opponent's foot. The fighter's chakra propels the opponent's foot to be stuck to the ground, disabling him from moving his foot from the ground for the next post.	3	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0
907	2	2	Right Season Worker's Glove	None	Physical Attack Diversity: By this point in the Stages a Right Season Worker begins to show that he is without a doubt a simple boxer. While still applying punches that are normally learned through most textbooks, he is not applying them to the near perfection that he may of did in the last level instead adding his own diversity of how he must fight to survive. It is also during this stage the a Right Season Worker begins to use methods that others would deem "questionable".Evasive Manuvering: Generally under the realization where someone is going to try to hit him the Right Season Worker will actually attempt to evade in the sense of performing straffing and feinting manuvers to avoid being hit, but will block when he absolutley must.Weapon Capabitlity: Generally by now the user has thought up of an interesting weapon that no one may of seen before, and generally this weapon is something quite obvious that combines a number of items together to form a weapon of simple ingeniousness. One who is looking at the weapon may find it impressive but will see it as nothing more then another usless trick that is easily pulled from the user's bag.	3	2	4	Uppercut: Generally seen as a ending punch then anything else, and uppercut generally works wonders when your opponent is already dazed as it applies more external force to the body and possibly cause the opponent to fall down. A Right Season Worker is also generally told that while an uppercut works wonder to a person's chin hitting the fleshy area behind the throat where it meets the front part of one's throat works even better.Elbow: Generally hitting someone with your elbow can be considered unethical, especially if he's already down. But of course that would never stop a Right Season Worker.Knee: A good move to use when you're to close to someone to throw a punch. Especially useful for digging into soft, fleshy, vulnerable areas such as the stomach. Also a Right Season Worker wouldn't object to kneeing a man in the testicles, and if it's a woman... hit her there anyways a knee to the crotch is never a laughing matter.Headbutt: Headbutts are generally done when a person is very close but has his face undefended. However novice Season Worker's tend to get the simple mechanics of a headbutt wrong. Many would believe that you swing your head back by the neck and rear that bad boy forward. While this works it can sometimes be more painful for you then the other guy, the true trick isn't to use your neck but to swing with your shoulders. This move is most likely why Right Season Workers wear their forehead protectors on their damn forehead.		6	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	6
907	3	3	Right Season Worker's Glove	None	Physical Attack Diversity: While still applying the mechanics of fighting he had learned from Stages 1 and 2 the worker is now weening himself on "learning" how to fight, having now grasped the principle ideals he begins to put more emphasis on trying to make the weapons on his gloves effective enough to make a full rounded fighter.Evasive Manuvering: Speed is put into more of an emphasis during Stages 3 and 4. Simply put while the worker knows how to block, feint, and roll to block or evade, he doesn't know how to do it quickly enough. Excercises in dexterity and agility are put into major emphasis for the next couple of stages. In this stage the character is showing his improvement in evading but still needs more improvement.Weapon Capability: By this point generally an additional tool is added onto the glove for the sake of fighting in a more effective matter. It's generally well concealed and showing it in the middle of a fight would in general suprise anyone as they would have no clue it wasn't there. Additional work is also put to the machinery of the glove and generally by this point either an additional weapon has been added or one of the original weapons put on the glove have an improvement.	3	2	4	Liver Punch: A punch to the liver freaking hurts, such a hit could make a person step back for a couple moments and wait for the pain to subside while he thinks about what he should do. However one thing to realize is finding the exact place where the liver is can be a problem...Rabbit Punch: This attack got it's name from hunters, they would put rabbits out of their misery by attacking the back of it's head where it meets the neck. Basically a Rabbit Punch is a swift curving close range punch aimed for one of two places, the back of the head or the kidneys. A rabbit punch to the back of the head can cause a quick moments of dizziness at this level, however at much much higher levels (and with a player's permission) worse things could happen. A rabbit punch to the kidney can also cause a lot of pain as well, and at much much higher levels can cause major discomfort later on.Breadbasket Punch: Generally considered a quick, sometimes hooking, punch to the upper section of the stomach. However if hit properly one could hit the diaphragm knocking the wind out of an opponent, this attack could cause a person to struggle around while he thinks he's suffocating. However the shock can generally be subsided quickly and the person can breathe again.Backhand/Spinning Backhand: A backhand punch generally hits harder then a normal punch, there's also generally more force put behind it as the fighter has to bring his hand back and then slam it into his opponent's face. Spinning Backhand is even more effective, but is harder to execute since you show your back to the opponent.		9	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	8
907	4	4	Right Season Worker's Glove	None	Physical Attack Diversity: By Stage 4 the worker is no longer learning new moves, instead he takes what he knows and continues to practice his fighting. Adapting his ability to the conditions set.Evasive Manuvering: While there will always be people out there quicker then you, the important thing is to attempt to stay sharp, block when you have to, and evade when it's possible. These are the final words that are generally given to a Right Season Worker as he finishes actual training. The truth is he has gotten faster, but only in the sense that when he has to he can evade, he can charge quickly in short burst, and he's barely fast enough to block an attack that he may of barely saw.Weapon Capability: By Stage 4 the worker, thanks to his own ingenuity and body conditioning, is able to power his glove without any necessary external power and instead can generally power his weapon independently by means of chakra. Weapon capabilities generally remain the same but the fact that they are charged by internal power generally means additional power in some fashion, but in returns most likely means a inefficient cooldown period.	3	2	4			16	10	17	0	0	0	0	0	14
907	5	5	Right Season Worker's Glove	None	Physical Conditioning: Since technically the worker is no longer learning but instead experiencing what's happening he generally continues additional training to condition his body to be stronger and faster and at the same time continues training in an attempt to strengthen his chakra reserves.Weapon Capability: Stage Five is generally considered a monumental moment in the progress of the weapon that the worker is creating. By this stage he has realigned specific functions of his glove in an attempt to make it look more appealing, possibly streamlined, and slightly more comforting to the user. Besides appearance changes the weapon is generally given another huge power intensive tool/weapon. This item is generally out of the ordinary of the standard tools that have graced the weapon before hand, and as such when someone saw it, would most likely be impressed.	3	2	4			20	15	21	0	0	0	0	0	16
907	6	6	Right Season Worker's Glove	None	Physical Conditioning: Physical Conditioning is slowly getting more and more intensive, the emphasis of training is generally put on one's stamina including a number things like weight running as well as going about the every day processes of life with weights. Once again not so much to improve strength but just to have the ability to push one self to a higher threshold.Weapon Capability: Weapon Capability hasn't changed much in all honesty. Generally during this period of time the worker is instead taking his time in getting accustomed to what his weapon is. Granted he may already be completly accustomed to it, after all he has built it for most of it's life time. But this time is generally spent in being able to perform an oddly amazing feat using one of the minor tools that is on the weapon, thanks to use of this intelligence and the additional body conditioning.	3	2	4			27	19	29	0	0	0	16	0	20
907	7	7	Right Season Worker's Glove	None	Weapon Capability: The final stage, generally by this stage the weapon (which has officially hit it's peak) can almost no longer be improved on. There is generally one last original weapon capability, or a tool of some sort that is added on. This item is generally a last measure, something that a character really doesn't want to use unless he's forced to defend his life.	3	2	4			32	27	40	0	0	0	19	0	25
906	1	1	Dance of the Overseer	Kantoku no Mai	Novice. The title holds true to the skill level at this point. Novices at this can barely move the whip around, and the eye must always be watching to make sure they don't snap themselves. Combat effectiveness is limited, the user being more prone to just spinning the whip and hitting the enemy in the ankles, rather then try any actual attempt of skill or daring. Practitioners, just not at this stage, are considered to be high priority targets due to the large amount of things they can do with their whip, from disarming, to tripping, to even swinging around like a monkey from various ledges.	5	a	4			4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
906	2	2	Dance of the Overseer	Kantoku no Mai	All right punk, pick it up. Users at this stage are expected to be able to fully be able to handle their whip without much fear of harming themselves. Their technique is horrible, and their form sloppy, but at least their hitting the bad guys. Users still haven't managed to grasp the art of disarming or trapping opponents, but at least they can hit them. Whip speed has gone up, to where a whip crack is loud enough to be heard for 30 feet. The user is just starting to get a feel for what his comfortable zone of contact is, usually the full length of the whip, plus arm length.	5	a	4	Name: Whip SwingDescription: Now possessing enough strength to be able to lift their body weight, users are able to swing and hook their whip around and object, and jump, leap, and swing to their hearts content provided the object they are latched to can support their weight.		7;	0	7;	0	0	0	6	0	0
906	3	3	Dance of the Overseer	Kantoku no Mai	Finally. Combat proficiency. The user is now able to make grabs at an enemy, finally being able to do a wide range of whip motion. The whip is faster, cracks are stronger, and hits are harder. The user is also more agile and deft with the whip, now being able to fully concentrate on hitting their target, not themselves. At this stage, users are capable, but not excellent at their chosen trade.	5	a	4	Name: GraspDescription: Finally, the user has enough skill with a whip to be able to grab appendages, as well as items. For items to be wrenched away, the user's strength needs to exceed the targets for a successful disarm. Evenly matched numbers result in a deadlock, and lower numbers result in failure.	Name: RiftDescription: Filling the very tip of their whip with chakra, the user cracks the whip down on the ground. The earth starts to tumble in a straight line. Progressively higher levels cause the tumbling to become larger, enabling Rift to throw their opponents from out under their feet. Base distance is 10 feet, with an extra foot added for every 2 strength. The depth of the "wave" is 5 feet, while the vertical motion can reach 10 feet.	10	0	10	0	0	0	8	0	0
906	4	4	Dance of the Overseer	Kantoku no Mai	Skilled, are we? Better then average, is more like it. At this stage, speed is emphasized more so then usual, in effort of being able to avoid hits, and counter with a vicious crack, that is yet still going faster. The whip is faster, the body is faster, the strikes, stronger, if only because the strength it takes to reach this stage. As well as normal physical growth, the user has become more confident in their abilities, and may even now try some...unorthodox methods.	5	a	4		Name: Rupture Description: Starting by wrapping the whip around a body part, such as a leg, or arm, the user secures the whip, and then infuses chakra into it. The whip is then snapped. The extra power from the infused chakra as well as the violent motion unto the limb, is enough to cause multiple fractures inside, and out, to the bone and arm.	15	13	15	0	0	0	14	0	0
906	5	5	Dance of the Overseer	Kantoku no Mai	Well now, the user at this stage is well on the path towards enlightenment. While Dance of the Overseer does not teach philosophy, it does teach even more whip skills. The user is enlightened, learning even better and more precise whip control, now able to hit a target the size of a can with a whip crack, able to wrap and lock their whip around any person, able to swing with nary a worry.	5	a	4			19	18	19	0	0	0	16	0	0
906	6	6	Dance of the Overseer	Kantoku no Mai	A master eh? Took you long enough. A master is fully capable of using his or her whip as an extension of the body, using it to attack, wrap and rupture limbs, as well as being able to fully use their whip as a defensive mechanism. Masters have near-perfect accuracy, speed, and their strength and stamina are phenomenal.	5	a	4		Name: ReflexDescription: Upon sighting of projectiles, most reflexes are to hold up their weapon, and use that as a shield. A whip however, doesn't grant quite the defensive measure, in the normal, orthodox sense. However, by spinning their whip quickly, it acts like a shield, able to deflect projectiles, as well as being able to negate all jutsu 1 stage or more below the users current level.	25	25	25	0	0	0	18	18	0
906	7	7	Dance of the Overseer	Kantoku no Mai	A god among men? Conceivable. Gods at this level, have perfect accuracy of their whip, judging less by skill, more on instinct, using their whips as they would an arm or a leg. Their whip cracks can easily rend human flesh, and even their wraps and disarms can cause lacerations. Their whip speed is at a blur, the only audible thing the whip crack and the whip moving. The user is a god, and their skills reflect that title.	4	5	h			33	33	33	0	0	0	22	22	0

904	1	1	Way of the Strategist 	Senryaku-Do	First a warrior must know the basics before they can find their way. Basic swordplay, a starting stance, and having the eyes of a warrior.A stage one practitioner has learned the rules of combat. They know to be dedicated to their blade, to their art, and to the Way. A warrior at this level of skill may not be a true samurai, but they can move like one. Training is harsh at this point. The user is still a beginner and must train their body and mind to manipulate their Chi. Focus is required in all things, and all tasks must be considered part of their art.	3	3	3	Name: IaiDrawing the blade and sheating it are important techniques. Iai is knowing how to draw a katana in one smooth motion, readying it for battle in the time it takes to breath.	Name: Kata - Kazedo (The Way of Wind)Requirements: A Katana or Wakizashi in handThe daisho is the Samurai. This kata is the first and most important use of Chi. Wielded blades glow white with energy, like a flame licking the blade. While wind is being maintained, even the weakest katana is unbreakable, the dullest steel is sharpened to perfection. Even though the Samurai may not survive, a normal blade will survive any non-chakra attack. This makes it useful in the Samurai's defense.	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
904	2	2	Way of the Strategist 	Senryaku-Do	After the basics, experience is the fastest way to progress. Whether learning from a master, or learning from scars, a warrior cannot find the way if all their time is spent indoors. At this stage, both offense and defense are trained by direct confrontation with opponents. It isn't uncommon to find warriors whose style has been transformed by one dangerous encounter. Knowing how to manipulate your Chi for the most basic techniques was difficult enough, now a warrior must learn how to adapt their own experiences into something useful in their style.	3	3	3	Name: KohanWith both blades drawn, the Samurai widens their vision and stance. Now they can take on all attackers. While multiple assailants can cause a problem, you should face many as you would face one. Watch their movements, strike when they are open, and know your surroundings. Cut from your weaker side to your stronger side, and eliminate one problem at a time.		6	0	8	0	0	0	0	6	0
904	3	3	Way of the Strategist 	Senryaku-Do	The last level for casual practitioners.A warrior now takes what they have learned, and use it to adjust. Like water, a warrior should never be thrown off guard. The variety of the experience is now as valuable as the quantity. Many warriors travel now, briefly, before they return to their master as a Samurai. While on their voyage, combat is important. They may work as a mercenary, or simply defend those who need it. To learn to guard against all comers, you need to put down a warrior of greater skill.A warrior that has not seen how the land works, has not seen the Way.	3	3	3	Name: OshiOptions are the best defense. This shoulder blow is useful against opponents who are skilled at stopping your blade. After a feint swing down, lower your shoulder and strike your target in their center. A strong strike can leave an opponent staggering for 15 feet before they can recover their stance.	Name: Kata - Mizudo (The Way of Water)A warrior must know how to move when they wish to. When an opening presents itself, the Samurai does not flourish, he strikes. The Samurai creates a burst of movement by harnessing their Chi. While moving this post, the Samurai has a 1/3rd increase in their speed level, rounded down (if they have speed level 4, they will gain 1 speed level, and go to speed level 5). After this post, the Samurai's speed level is reduced by that many levels, for 2 post.	8	0	12	0	0	0	0	8	0
904	4	4	Way of the Strategist 	Senryaku-Do	All who remain are Samurai.A Samurai of this level has blazed their own trail, leaving only sweat and blood. While Senryaku-do focuses on enduring, a time comes when a weakness must be eliminated. This stage focuses on forceful swordplay, the basics established in the previous stages are now used to strike out at opponents. It does not matter if the Samurai is on a battlefield, or in a duel, they need many tools to strike down a weak opponent.	3	3	3	Name: TojiThe body like glue. When an enemy seeks space, you should crowd them. Lock blades with an enemy, and then never let them escape. Charge them, and see the quality of their swordplay. Once they leave themselves open, you will see the way to strike them down. This requires keeping a good eye on your surroundings and your opponent, so you can easily traverse whatever obstacles they have, and keep them reeling.	Name: Kata - Hido (The Way of Fire)If a fool wishes to place himself in a cage, let him die in it. A Samurai strikes when an opponent has left themselves weak. With Chi focused into a blade, a slash will crush barriers. The glowing blade flows through the barrier like water, and can still strike anyone foolish enough to stand on the other side. This attack counts as a stage 5 ninjutsu attack for the sake of piercing defensive jutsu. It ends any ongoing defensive jutsu that it pierces. With opponent's permission, it will shatter armor or weaker weapons. It may not be used for 3 post after it has been used.	14	13	16	0	0	0	0	14	0
904	5	5	Way of the Strategist 	Senryaku-Do	The original Senryaku-do was meant for Samurai fighting other Samurai. The Chi extended by well trained warriors was enough to drive down a weaker opponent by itself. When the style resurfaced, techniques needed to be readjusted. Now was the age of the ninja, and their techniques were unheard of when the original style was created. Positioning and observation are most important in this stage. If you wish to survive a battle against a ninja, you must be completely sure where you are, and where they are not. Movement is especially important, as you should be fluid without needing to resort to the dancing of a performer. Make every move count, and spend as little time guarding as you need to. This leaves you ready to counter attack.	3	3	3	Name: EngiAllow their waste. Legend has risen of Samurai defeating one another by one blow, a long duel. While an honorable death in a duel is acceptable, sometimes you must force an opponent into an incorrect stance. This technique is a feint duel, deflecting their sword blow at the last moment and continuing the fight in close quarters.	Name: Kata - Doudo (The Way of Earth)An attack of ninjutsu, corrupted Chi, can be slain just as easily as its creator. By expressing the Chi, a Samurai strikes the enemy's technique where it is weakest. The blade diverts the blow, and the Chi protects the warrior, sweeping away all excess from the defeated technique. With Doudo, a fireball is split in twain, and the leftover cinders feel like a breeze. This kata can defend against ninjutsu level 5 and below. It cannot be used for 2 post after it is used. It may only be used three times a thread.	18	16	22	0	0	0	0	16	0
904	6	6	Way of the Strategist 	Senryaku-Do	Mastery, this is what most records consider the final stage of the style. Having realized their own path, a Samurai must again find a technique of their own. When they are a master to a student, this will be the cornerstone of what they pass on to others. This final stage does not focus on one particular thing, that is up to the practitioner.	3	3	3			26	19	30	0	0	0	16	20	0
904	7	7	Way of the Strategist 	Senryaku-Do	The hidden final stage. A warrior who reaches this stage has come close to finding the void. Their dedication has paid off. They have shed unneeded concerns and responsibilities. What remains is their mission, their body, and their blades.	3	3	3		Name: Kata - Muukodo (The Way of Void)Sometimes there is no other way but to end a fight swiftly, putting honor at risk. Muukodo requires a moment of focus, so a post is spent where the warrior cannot attack or move except to defend. A two-hand strike is unleashed, not quickly, but a perfected slice bolstered by their Chi. The blade splits the very air, and then the blow continues out to anything the Samurai wishes. All targets in a 25 foot cone in front of the Samurai are struck as if the Katana hit them directly. The only exception is targets the Samurai purposely ignores. This can fell a small piece of a forest, mangle a building, or kill an assassin while sparing a crowd. After this Kata is used, no more Kata may be used in that thread.	34	26	39	0	0	0	20	24	0
903	1	1	Dance of the Savage 	None	Description: Like a young predator, the savage is just beginning to sharpen its teeth and claws. Awkward and clumsy the savage like the newborn predator often stumbles upon himself while attempting to be ferocious.The savage at this stage relies on the basic stance like a crutch. The basic stance consists of holding the strong-arm falcata on the level of the head with the blade over the shoulder. The off-hand is simply held out in front of the savage. This allows the savage to try and bat at any incoming attacks as the young savage doesn't have the coordination for a full swing with the off-hand.The downward strikes of the savage are strongest and most effective of his attacks. All other attacks are clumsy and awkward and so at this level the savage merely hacks downward as much as possible. Most attacks are aimed at the limbs as the savage simply does not have the power to cleave through the thicker parts of the body.Stances (note that the stances do not affect stats)The PupThe savage holds the left falcata out in front with the left arm only slightly bent. The right falcata is held at about the ear level, the edge of the blade up ready to chop down.Attack Breakers: The savage, even with the help of the falcata hilt shape, is often unable to break any attack but weak ones. Anything above that and the falcata will most likely fly from the savage's hand due to the recoil. Of course if that happens to the attacker as well then at least the savage has another falcata.Cleaving: The savage can remove an opponent's hand with one strong single strike.Punches: Unable to punch with full force, the savage really is better off hacking at an opponent with his falcata.Dual Wielding: The off-hand weapon is awkward. At this point it is kept in hand mostly for defensive reasons and even then the reaction is slow and doesn't pose much of a defense.	5	a	4			5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
903	2	2	Dance of the Savage 	None	Description: The savage now has mastered the beginning stance and learned an additional stance with the simple name of Initial Savage. The savage still only aims his attacks at the limbs. All attacks are meant to be fight ending and with the limited strength and coordination of the savage at this level, hacking off a limb with repeated strikes is the easiest way to end a fight.The Savage also begins to try attack breaking. They lash out at simple attacks in an attempt to knock the attacks away. The recoil often throws both attacker and savage off balance but the savage has learned to recover more quickly than most.Training has become more intense. The savage submits himself to intense abuse. It is not uncommon for a savage to need medical healing three or four times a day. They are only now beginning to build up their endurance and their aggressive style often results in numerous scars all over their hands and arms from fails attempts at attack breaking. Still, it is now when their berserker's trance begins to take shape. Pain is encouraged so they can become used to it, live with it and ignore it.StancesInitial SavageBoth arms are held in front of the body, the elbows bent almost to a right angle. The falcata cross with the left falcata on the outside, leading the right falcate, both held above the head. This is the first of the truly savage stances. Defense is almost completely ignored as the savage relies on his rage and tolerance for pain. The falcata are ready to strike out at any time be it to break an attack or cleave an arm.Attack Breakers: There is great recoil when striking in full strength an attack that is coming in full power. The savage is only just able to keep from losing his falcata and that's mostly due to the shape of the hilt.Cleaving: The savage can nearly cut off the leg or arm off a full grown man, but usually it takes two or three swings. It is a bloody, beautiful business.Punches: The strength of the punches has increased and now the savage may strike with almost complete strength, still he is better off using his falcata to attack.Dual Wielding: The off-hand has improved its control but only to the point where it can be held steady in the face of an attack.	5	a	4			8	0	6	0	0	0	0	6	0
903	3	3	Dance of the Savage 	None	Description: The savage's strength has increased so he can grip extremely tightly around the hilts of his falcata. Trying to pry something from a savage's grasp is like trying to break free of a python's death grip. Harnessing their rage and ferocity they now often charge straight into an attack, breaking it or not, they continue to press their attack. Now is the level where the warrior truly begins to become savage. They roar and growl as they fight, seeming to be some kind of animal, they ignore minor cuts and bruises. In fact, they don't even shy away from injury, such is their savagery. Fully willing to let their blood mix with their enemies, they rely on their extreme stamina to keep them moving in battle. Now they aim for vital organs. They seek to slash a man's spine, crack his head, and almost completely ignore attacking the limbs. Only to demean an opponent will they cut at another's limbs, but that's only when they want them to suffer. True warriors, they consider a quick and savage death to be a gift of honor they bestow upon their adversaries. Long, drawn-out pain is reserved for the weak and those without honor.StancesTwin CleaverThe left falcata is held at shoulder level, the blade up. The right falcata is held at the level of the ear, the blade pointing back. From this position the left falcata is often used to try to break through defenses, creating an opening for the cleaving action of the right falcata.Crescent MoonBoth falcata are held upside down. The left falcata is held down at the waist, the right at chest level. From this position the savage usually slashes horizontally or diagonally and punches in a variety of hooks and uppercuts. Attacks are easily broken from this stance but the strikes are weaker. The attack breaking is performed by the right falcata while the left falcata does most of the attacking.Off Half-MoonThe left falcata is held upside down in a fist. The left fist is then held up to the chin. The right elbow is bent at a right angle and the right falcata angles across the body, the blade in front of the left arm. From this position the savage often stabs out or even jabs with the left arm while the right arms usually slashes out diagonally.Attack Breakers: No longer in danger of losing his falcata from the recoil of breaking an attack the savage seeks more often to break attacks rather than just block them. Recoil has begun to shift now more in the direction of the attacker whereas before it was equal.Cleaving: The savage may cut off a limb, as long as it is not through the femur. Necks? Not a problem either.Punches: The savage almost blindly punches. They concentrate so much on the strength of the blow that they don't always hit what they aim at.Dual Wielding: Only now may the off-hand really even begin to be used both offensively and defensively. However off-hand attacks while still as strong are more awkward and less accurate.	5	a	4			12	0	8	0	0	0	0	8	0
903	4	4	Dance of the Savage 	None	Description: The savage often sees blood, whether it be his own in training or his adversary's in battle. Experiencing nearly endless pain the savage begins to turn it from a cautionary sensation to one that actually fuels his adrenaline. When you hurt him you only make him angrier.StancesHowling MoonBoth the left and right falcata are held upside down. The rest of the stance is nearly identical to 'The Pup'. The right falcata is held above the shoulder on the level of the ear, the left falcata is held out in front of the savage. Only instead of being only slightly bent, the arm is bent a little forming a 120-degree angle. From this stance the savage can stab downwards or straight, punch or lash upwards. Attacks are broken through a punching action, using the weighted end of the falcata to strike.Reverse Crescent MoonThe mirror image of the Crescent Moon stance, this stance focuses on stronger uppercuts and upper slashes. The strikes are much stronger than its counterpart but in turn the attack breaks are weaker as they are performed by the left hand.WolverineBoth falcata are held upside down. The left falcata is held in front of the chin, the right falcata on the level of the savage's ear. The left foot is placed forward. This stance is primarily used to stab, make upward attacks, or to launch a variety of punches.Attack Breakers: The recoil from breaking an attack while it heavily leans toward the attacker is still present for the savage himself. If the savage becomes careless his sword may slip from his hand.Cleaving: A savage may strike a man on the top of the head and cleave him down to his belly. He still doesn't have the power to cleave clean through the femur.Punches: Strikes are powerful, not extremely fast but powerful.Dual Wielding: There is no difference defensively anymore between the off-hand and the strong-hand. Offensively the power and precision has improved significantly.	5	a	4			17	13	13	0	0	0	0	14	0
903	5	5	Dance of the Savage 	None	Description: Scars, muscle and sinew cover the savage's body. Savagery is not only a state of mind but a tool of psychological warfare. The savage doesn't just kill, he butchers people in the hopes that others will see it and fear him.StancesTrue SavageThe arms are held at chest level in front of the savage, elbows pointing out and one hand on top of the other. The left falcata runs along the bottom of the right forearm and the right falcata runs along the top of the left forearm. From this position attacks are aimed at the mid level of the adversary. The advantage of this stance is that either falcata may break an attack or attack. While the savage may beat away with the bottom of his fists the usual attack is a full powered horizontal or diagonal attack. The left falcata may be swung at a descending angle, the right falcata at a rising angle or both swung in a scissor action.Rising MoonBoth falcata are held upside down. Both held at just above and near the waist. From this position either falcata may be used in rising strikes from blade or hilt.Attack Breakers: Up until now recoil was a problem but now the power in the savage's arm is such that no recoil is present when breaking attacks. The recoil has all been transferred completely to the attacker himself.Cleaving: A savage can strike a man on the top of his head and continue to cleave him straight down the middle. Limbs pose no problem.Punches: Precision and weak points are stressed. The savage seeks to powerfully strike an opponent's weak points and while not always accurate the strikes are very potent.Dual Wielding: The offensive precision of the off-hand has neared perfection. It still is not quite equal to the control and reflexes of the strong-hand but the gap is narrowing.	5	a	4			25	15	16	0	0	0	0	16	0
903	6	6	Dance of the Savage 	None	Description: Refined in brutality, the savage seeks for ways to dominate his adversary. Letting nothing stand in his way, the savage would rather rip through a tree than walk around or climb over it. If any man, woman or child stands in the way of a savage they will be dealt with. The savage knows no mercy, only the pure extremes of functionality and of getting the task done. Remorse and regret have been trained out of the savage, there is too little time to spend wasting on foolish thoughts.StancesHigh MoonBoth falcata are held upside down. Held up by the ear above the shoulders the stance is an offensive one. The savage stabs or slashes downward usually but the option remains to strike upward at either an attack or a taller opponent.BearBoth falcata are held up by the ear and above the shoulder. From this stance the savage may powerfully cleave anywhere above his knee level. The savage never punches from this position. Attack breaks are extremely effective against horizontal or diagonal attacks. The savage also often leads with one falcata to break through defenses and then strikes with the other falcata.West WindThe left falcata is held out in front of the body as with 'The Pup' stance only the arm forms a 120 degree angle. The right arm is held across the body with the right hand about six to eight inches below the armpit. The right falcata points straight back from the direction the savage faces. From this stance the savage presents a powerful left side where they can both break attacks, break through defenses or cleave away. The right side is left somewhat open though.East WindThe right falcata is held out in front of the body as with 'The Pup' stance only the arm forms a 120 degree angle. The left arm is held across the body with the left hand about six to eight inches below the right armpit. The left falcata points straight back from the direction the savage faces. From this stance the savage presents a powerful right side where they can both break attacks, break through defenses or cleave away. The left side is left somewhat open though.Attack Breakers: Beating weapons away has become an enjoyable game. Not only is there no recoil but the savage actually is able to complete the movement of his falcata almost as if there were no obstacle in its path.Cleaving: Full powered attacks strike through helmets and shields. All but the thickest of armors are useless against such blows.Punches: Slugging it out is a very viable option for a savage. With powerful punches usually aimed at the softest and weakest bones the savage can brutally mangle his opponent.Dual Wielding: The two falcata move in complete coordination with each other. They do not touch unless the savage wants them to. Accuracy has been obtained, power (always there) is augmented even further. The off-hand has become the strong-hand. There is no longer an off-hand. As a side note, the savage can now write with both hands.	5	a	4			30	22	23	0	0	0	16	22	0
903	7	7	Dance of the Savage 	None	Description: Moving from stance to stance with the ease of walking the savage is able to adapt to nearly any situation in a moment's notice. Charging straight into the thickest melees and worse situations the savage ignores the damage he takes as he concentrates on dealing out the extreme amount of hurt he routinely does. Pain leads him to true feral rage. Savagery isn't just a term; it is a way of life. Why arm-wrestle someone when you can just rip his arm off? Why carry a man to safety when you can throw him there even more easily?StancesFinal SavageHolding both falcata out either right side up or upside down, the savage holds the falcata in front of his chest with his arms at a 120-degree angle. The savage often leaps straight at a foe in this stance, or spins to attack. The stance is meant for dealing with those who have longer weapons. It takes great strength to master and that it why it is the first of the final stances the savage learns.Naked SavageHolding both falcata upside down the savage carries them pressed against the bottom of his forearm. In this way it may appear that the savage isn't even carrying weapons. Making someone believe the savage is unarmed hardly ever works. In practice this stance allows the savage to very quickly whip the two falcata around with any swinging motion of his arm. The blows from the naked savage are very strong indeed.ChallengeHolding the falcata out above the head in a V shape the savage bellows roars challenge after challenge. The longer he awaits a challenge the more feral rage he builds up. While this may appear to be an open position, the savage is still quite capable of swinging either arm in for a powerful diagonal attack, or ducking and then sweeping at the adversary's feet.Attack Breakers: The incredible power used to break attacks has been known to shatter the bones in the attacker, rip the attacker's arm out of his socket. Needless to say the attacking weapon unless strapped on or gripped extremely tightly often flies from the hand of the attacker.Cleaving: A single stroke is not only enough to kill a man but enough to cleave a man wearing thick plate-mail in two.Punches: The brute blunt trauma on the receiving end of a fist is now just as deadly as the razor sword of the falcata in the hand of a savage.Dual Wielding: The two falcata have become mere extensions of the savage himself. He can control both weapons just as easily*Note: though the descriptions use left and right hand ... the left hand in this case is the same thing as the off-hand, the right hand the same thing as the dominant/strong-hand. A lefty may learn this weapon style just as easily.	5	a	4			39	30	30	0	0	0	20	24	0
902	1	1	Chase the Devil Sword	Onigokko Kenjutsu	At this point, the style practitioner can not use the 'feint' abilities at all. They are just learning of the concept of altering chakra to make an illusionary aura around themselves and their weapon. Everything they think they know comes directly from their teacher's mouth or a book, not from experience. As far as their abilities physically go, they now have a good amount of speed, despite their actual inexperience on the battle field. While they can't dodge with much fluidity, they are still evasively based in their defenses. Their use of their sword is basic, basic, basic, and as such they have no real 'techniques'.		3			Special Technique: Blind the DevilDescription:The user holds his sword in front of him so that the side of it, not the blade, is facing the opponent, and then shouts "Flash!" At that moment, a very bright light will seem to emit from the sword, blinding the target for a full post, and allowing the user to attack. For this to work, the target must be able to see the sword, although they do not have to be directly looking at it. Can only affect one target at a time.Trigger: Vision/Sound - Sword/ShoutDuration: Immediate	0	0	0	0	4	4	0	0	0
902	2	2	Chase the Devil Sword	Onigokko Kenjutsu	Having finally learned to use the feint ability, the user can now alter their physical location, as well as the location of any weapon in hand by four inches. While this may not seem like much, depending on how it is used, it can be. Most commonly, they use this to effect the enemy's depth perception, causing them to block a second sooner or a second too late. Physically, nothing much has changed since the previous stage, with the exception of them having improved their speed. As far as sword abilities go, they now have grasped the basics of sword fighting and are moving on to the more advanced aspects.		3		Normal Technique: Initiate IDescription: As the feint ability is far from passive, it must be initiated. To do so, the user must make sure all those soon to be under its effects see the blade of the weapon. The entire blade must be seen for the technique to be properly initiated. This technique lasts for a base post of one, with an additional post for every stage of Onigokko that the user possesses. If at any time they make full contact with the opponent, the illusion will be cancelled.Normal Technique: ReleaseDescription: At the user's command, the feint ability's illusion is removed, revealing the user's actual location. This technique remains the same at all stages of the taijutsu style.	Special Technique: Tag the DevilDescription: Raising their sword into an opponent's line of sight, the user will shout 'tag!' Suddenly, bursting forth from their body, an exact replica of the user will charge straight for the opponent. Like the bunshin that it is, it will disappear on contact. Typically, the technique is used to confuse an opponent with the fake while the user him/herself circles around to the side and delivers a simultaneous attack.Trigger: Vision/Sound - Sword/ShoutDuration: Immediate/One Post	0	6	0	0	7	7	0	0	0
902	3	3	Chase the Devil Sword	Onigokko Kenjutsu	Now with experience of their own using the feint ability, as well as more training in the ways of genjutsu, the person in question can alter their location and the location of their weapon (still must be in hand), by eight inches. As far as dodging abilities go, their instincts have improved drastically from the original stage. They can fully follow taijutsu users of the same speed or lower as them, carefully watching every moment until they can begin to predict the movements to come. Speed is now very important to the style, as their strength is still very low compared to users of other styles. Stamina is also a large focus, as to continuously avoid enemy attacks they must have a large supply of energy.		3		Normal Technique: Initiate IIDescription: A more advanced version of Initiate I. The main difference in this one is that the required amount of blade needed to be seen is lowered. Whereas in the first version, the entire blade was needed to be seen, at this stage only half of the blade (whatever the length) must be revealed. This technique lasts for a base post of one, with an additional post for every stage of Onigokko that the user possesses. If at any time they make full contact with the opponent, the illusion will be cancelled.	Special Technique: Surprise the DevilDescription: Raising their sword into an opponent's line of sight, the user will shout 'surprise!' This technique creates an illusion of a clone of the user appearing right behind the enemy. The illusionary clone appears with its blade piercing through the opponent. As the target is hit with the pain and sight of a sword stabbing them from behind, the user will simultaneously deliver the real attack.Trigger: Vision/Sound - Sword/ShoutBase Duration: Immediate/One Post	0	8	0	0	10	10	0	0	0
902	4	4	Chase the Devil Sword	Onigokko Kenjutsu	At this stage, the practitioner of the style has furthered their knowledge of the mechanics of the feint ability, as well as become more and more experienced in using it while fighting. They can now alter their physical location by one foot any which direction. Also at this point, they do not have to be within physical contact of their weapon. As long as the weapon is six inches or closer to them, it is still under the feint ability effects. Evasive ability has made more improvement as well. They are now capable of following enemies with speed up to ten more then their own with ease, dodging the attacks best as possible while trying to learn what to expect next based on the style. Physically, their speed has improved rather dramatically compared to the last stage, making it much easier for their dodging based defenses.		3		Normal Technique: Initiate IIIDescription: A more advanced version of Initiate II. The main difference in this one is that the required amount of blade needed to be seen is lowered. Whereas in the second version, half of the entire blade was needed to be seen, at this stage any amount of the blade being seen will do. That's right. The smallest amount of metal that catches the enemy's eye will suffice. This technique lasts for a base post of one, with an additional post for every stage of Onigokko that the user possesses. If at any time they make full contact with the opponent, the illusion will be cancelled.Special Technique: Court the DevilDescription: Raising their sword into an opponent's line of sight, the user will disappear in a flock of birds. The crows will surround the enemy, swarming around them, pecking at them, and, effectively, creating a cloud of black around them. The user, moving amongst the birds-although quite difficult to see, given the right conditions-will then deliver a series of superficial slashes, attempting to match each cut with a peck/claw of the illusionary crows. They may deliver one superficial cut for every point of willpower.Trigger: Vision - SwordMin Duration: Zero PostsBase Duration: One PostMax Duration: Three Posts		0	14	0	13	15	15	0	0	0
902	5	5	Chase the Devil Sword	Onigokko Kenjutsu	The Feint Ability is now nearing its most dangerous point. At this stage, the user of the Onigokko can alter their own apparent physical location by two feet in any direction of choice, be that straight, back, to the left, to the right, or diagonally (same with all stages, just a longer distance). They can also be up to one foot away from their weapon and still alter its apparent location. Their speed and dodging abilities have also improved a little over the previous stage.		3		Normal Technique: Initiate IVDescription: A more advanced version of Initiate III. The main difference in this one is that the required amount of blade needed to be seen is lowered. Whereas in the third version, any portion of the blade of the weapon in question needed to be seen, at this stage only the hilt of the weapon must meet with the target's eye. As in, it doesn't even need to be unsheathed to catch them in the feint illusion. This technique lasts for a base post of one, with an additional post for every stage of Onigokko that the user possesses. If at any time they make full contact with the opponent, the illusion will be canceled.	Special Technique: Catch the DevilDescription: Raising their sword into an opponent's line of sight, the user will shout 'rise!' Bursting forth from the ground, two large red arms, belonging to the fabled 'Oni', will wrap themselves tightly around the opponent's legs, waist, and torso. Only their arms are left free, and, even then, they find them more difficult to move than they otherwise would-movement hindered by the squeeze of the devil's fists. Bringing their sword back down, the user will typically aim to take advantage of the opening by delivering a quick slash.Trigger: Vision/Sound - Sword/ShoutMin Duration: Zero PostsBase Duration: One PostMax Duration: Two Posts	0	16	0	18	19	19	0	0	0
902	6	6	Chase the Devil Sword	Onigokko Kenjutsu	This is where the feint ability reaches its peak. The user can alter their apparent physical location by three feet, again any which way. They can also alter the appearance of their weapon up to two feet away from them. Physically, their speed has taken another large leap. Their ability to predict their opponents' attacks based on observed attack patterns is also at its best and their ability to dodge seemingly 'unavoidable' barrages of weaponry and jutsu has reached its peek.		3		Normal Technique: Initiate VDescription: A more advanced version of Initiate IV. The main difference in this one is that the required section of the weapon needed to be seen has changed. In fact, the weapon itself does not need to be seen at all. Only one of the user's hands must be seen by the target. This technique lasts for a base post of one, with an additional post for every stage of Onigokko that the user possesses. If at any time they make full contact with the opponent, the illusion will be canceled.	Special Technique: Charge the DevilDescription: This technique, unlike the majority of the others in this taijutsu, does not have an audio trigger. Instead, the trigger is that the target must have a clear view of the user's sword as the jutsu is performed. When it is performed, the user opens their mouth, shouting "Charge!" but in fact that is part of the genjutsu, because although the target would see the user's mouth moving, he or she would hear the voice coming from directly behind them. If the target turns around, he or she would see a bunshin there, and then, all at once, a circle of clones appear around the target. All at once, the circle of clones charges in for an attack along with the user. The clones may perform any number of obfuscating charge-tactics that the user wishes during the attack, but once they charge in and make contact, all the clones vanish.Trigger: Visual - SwordMin Duration: One PostBase Duration: One PostMax Duration: Two Posts	0	19	17	25	25	25	0	0	0

However, practitioners of Onigokko that reach this level are just a stone's throw away from the technique that demonstrates mastery of the taijutsu.		3			Special Technique: Elude the DevilDescription: Raising their sword into an opponent's line of sight, the user will shout 'elude!' Suddenly, the user will erupt in a flock of crows. Though, unlike 'Court the Devil', the crows will simply fly away into the air, leaving a void where the user previously appeared to be. From that point on-as long as the technique lasts-the user will find themselves invisible to all in the immediate area. They can not be smelled, they can not be heard, they can not be seen, and-best of all-they can not be felt. Only the cold steel of their blade can be felt, as it cuts into the flesh of an enemy.Trigger: Vision/Sound - Sword/ShoutMin Duration: One PostBase Duration: One PostIMPORTANT NOTE: To use the Feint Ability, the user must use the Initiate technique in their post.

955	1	1	Ryuujin-Fu	None	So now we get straight into the mix. A person who trains in this style is considered to be a true warrior who will never back down from a challenge. The basics of Ryuujin-Fu are taught at this level. Damage in the form of receiving and giving take a backseat to training ones flame affinity and agility at the beginning of training. A practitioner's strikes are somewhat basic and take the form of standard kicks and punches or in some cases palm strikes. Users focus upon going from standing still too full speed in the form of a harsh dash that lunges themselves towards their opponents in an array of flame and power.	2	5	2		Special Technique requirements: Control 2, Power 2-Tenka [Ignition]One of the fundamentals of Ryuujin-Fu, Tenka allows the user to create the flames required for the style. However, the technique is only used to spark flames and thus isn't terribly potent. At this level, a small flame that encircles the entire hands and feet of the user can be lit, and it is only able to singe skin if contact is maintained along with burning clothing but require frequent strikes in the same area in order to attain the same result. The flame lasts for a number of posts equal to the control of the user; between death of the flame and creation of another one, there is however a cooldown of 1 post.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The offence of a practitioner of this style begins to shift from a somewhat basic mindset into something of an offensive demon. Any user of this style is prone to charge headfirst into battle with their limbs blazing as they use their fists and feet as their main offensive weapons as they are coated in flame. Small acrobatic feats tend to become commonplace as the user focuses around making the enemy play to his own game.	2	5	2		Special Technique requirements: Control 4, Power 4	7	7	0	0	0	0	0	6	0

The body of a Ryuujin-Fu user now begins to tone itself out more and more as the user becomes a true fire demon - additional emphasis being put on speed and power.	2	5	2		Special Technique requirements: Control 7, Power 7, Reserves 6-Fireworks [Hanabi]Requirements: TenkaWith this technique, the user is able to make the flames 'extend' from the hands and feet of the user by approximately 5 inches - the name of the technique comes from the fact that the protruding flames make slight crackling sounds as they 'dance' around the practitioner's limbs. The damage caused by the flames has not increased; merely the range and intensity of the glow which has now taken on something similar to a bush fire. 'Fireworks' lasts for a maximum of 5 posts; there is a cool down of 1 post before it can be used again.	10	10	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
955	4	4	Ryuujin-Fu	None	The training here begins to show considerably as the fluidity and finesse of Ryuujin-fu becomes apparent. Powerful and sleek, the body of the user is enviable by most counts, but the manner in which it is used is what is really noteworthy. The power behind each blow delivered is both powerful and swift, for a breaking pattern helps conceal the user's intention. A quick punch to the chest can be halted mid-air and the momentum be carried into their shoulder, which in turn is aimed at an opponent's face. A sweeping kick can be carried past the user and into a roundhouse kick, in a true display of nimbleness.	2	5	2		Special Technique requirements: Control 10, Power 10, Reserves 8	15	15	13	0	0	0	0	14	0
955	5	5	Ryuujin-Fu	None	A more detailed fighting compendium is acquired at this stage, for the user now begins now only to mix up the elaborate movements of each attack, but also the effect of each. Converting a punch into a palm strike helps maintain the stamina of the user, since the stress upon his or her body is lessened around the area of impact. A palm strike can be forced into greater speed when shifting it into a spear-handed strike, jolting the opponent with harsh speed but causing little damage over all. And from a speedy spear strike to a close-fisted punch that delivers full impact at moderate speed. All attribute to the style's power, but also spells a unique versatility. Certain strikes can snap bones, or repeated weaker strikes can leave a certain area sore and prone to greater damage. The offensive knack of this style only gains more here.	2	5	2		Special Technique requirements: Control 15, Power 15, Reserves 13-Shounetsu [Inferno]Requirement: HanabiWith this technique, the user is able to increase the extent to which his limbs are surrounded by flames end from his hands to his elbows and from his feet to his knees - the fire swirling around the appendages not only useful for offence, but also causing slight damage to those attacking the user at those areas. Strikes used in conjunction with Inferno are also able to cause 1st degree burns to exposed skin.	18	22	16	0	0	0	0	16	0
955	6	6	Ryuujin-Fu	None	Speed and strength blend together perfectly now as the user moves as a blur across the battlefield, leaving broken bones in their wake. However, the keepsake of this stage is defense. Previously the user was merely nimble, perhaps agile enough to perform acrobatic feats as a form of evasion. Here, however, the user is much more capable of not only dodging attacks, but preventing them all together. Combining their speed with precise strikes aimed at specific joints, the user is able to impede an attack by sheer virtue that these points cannot be trained to withstand such force. The jolt overloads the nerve receptors in that area and cause it to go numb. As a form of defense, this effect lasts for a single post and can only affect a single part the body.	2	5	2		Special Technique requirements: Control 19, Power 19, Reserves 18-Nenshou [Combustion]Requirements: ShounetsuWith this technique, the Ryuujin Fu user is now able to ignite flames to the extent where they are capable of causing 2nd degree burns to exposed flesh if they maintain contact for more than one second. Those flames can only be maintained for a maximum of four posts, with a cool down of 1 post before the user can spark new ones.	30	30	15	0	0	0	18	18	0
955	7	7	Ryuujin-Fu	None	The agility, speed and nimbleness of the user have now been further polished, making him a master of the style. His power having increased as well, the user's strike alone are capable of inflicting serious damage even in the absence of the flames.	2	5	2		Special Technique requirements: Control 26, Power 25, Reserves 24-Gouka [Hellfire]Requirements: NenshouThe true mastery of Ryuujin-Fu has now been reached. No longer is the user a man, he is the living embodiment of rage and flame. The power of his flames have now reached the ability to cause third degree burns to exposed skin, making a master of style a true weapon indeed. The fact that his flames now eat anything they touch only makes the speed of a Ryuujin-Fu user even more horrifying. Mere pigments of colour to anything that is watching, one can feel the heat from their bodies long before they could ever feel a blow coming, but by that point it is often too late. Very few people could ever hope to reach this level of strength because at this point in their life they have probably been consumed by their own rage and power...returning them to the ash from once they came.	40	40	19	0	0	0	22	22	0
954	1	1	Dances of the Sun and Moon	Santsuki no Mai		4	5		- Mikazuki No Mai (Dance of the Crescent Moon)Description: A sword technique that creates one clone of the user. The two replicas attack in a dance of swords that confuses the opponent.	Special Technique requirements: Intelligence 2, Tactics 2-Ten Bunshin (Celestial Clone)These bunshin mirror the actions of their creator, allowing the confusing dance of the Santsuki no Mai. By itself, this creates one clone, though other techniques may create more as noted. These bunshin usually die with one hit, and act just like their creator but with 1/3rd the strength. Other techniques in this taijutsu may modify the Ten no Bunshin. This technique is required to continue in this list.- Irihi no Mai (Dance of the Dawning Sun)Description: Like in the Mikazuki no Mai, a bunshin is created. However, one clone is translucent because of the chakra being used elsewhere, and it is obvious which the real attacker is. The chakra from the clone is used to boost the speed of the user as he runs past the enemy in unison with his clone, and at the moment of contact with the target, the clone becomes corporeal for a split second as its sword hits the target with the wielder's sword, doing fast, quick, hard damage together in one strike.	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
954	2	2	Dances of the Sun and Moon	Santsuki no Mai		4	5		- Hantsuki No Mai (Dance of the Half Moon)Requirements: Mikazuki No MaiDescription: This particular sword dance technique improves the Mikazuki no Mai by adding a second replica behind the opponent that attacks with the other two, creating a three-pronged attack around the opponent in a triangular formation, further confusing the possibility of which angle the attack is coming from.

954	3	3	Dances of the Sun and Moon	Santsuki no Mai		4	5		- Meigetsu No Mai (Dance of the Full Moon)Requirements: Hantsuki No MaiDescription: The sword-dance of the Leaf is taken on a new level as the user and his three clones attack the opponent from a target's four corners, two in the front and two in the back, equalizing a change of getting attacked from in front or behind and making it harder for the enemy to determine where to fight.	Special Technique requirements: Intelligence 7, Tactics 7, Willpower 6- Kyokujitsu no Mai (Dance of Rising Sun)Requirements: Irihi no MaiDescription: Due to the addition of a second clone (similar to the one in Irihi no Mai), the potential strength of the attack is tripled. Once he has mastered this technique, the user can choose the placement of his clones anywhere around the target as long as the clone is the same short distance away from the target as the user is.	8	12	0	8	0	0	0	0	0
954	4	4	Dances of the Sun and Moon	Santsuki no Mai		4	5		- Garou Tsuki no Mai (Dance of the Wolf Moon)Requirements: Meigetsu no MaiDescription: The Tsuki no Kenbu's beautiful style is taken to a whole other dimension with this technique. There are two circles of bunshins surrounding the target, four in the outer and three in the inner. The real user may be in any one of these positions. Also, the two rings are spinning in opposite directions, making it very difficult to predict from where the shinobi will strike.	Special Technique requirements: Intelligence 10, Tactics 10, Willpower 8- Chuushuunomeigetsu no Mai (Dance of the Harvest Moon)Requirements: Garou Tsuki no MaiDescription: Adds a third, larger ring of five clones around the Garou Tsuki's original two, going in the opposite direction. There are now three rings circling around the opponent, the inner and outer going one direction, with the one in the middle, going in the opposite direction.-Hinoiri no Mai (Dance of the Sunset)Requirements: Kyokujitsu no MaiDescription: Adds a third clone that becomes corporeal at the moment of strike. In addition of this, unlike in the weaker versions, one of the 3 clones does not appear translucent, thus making it harder for the target to distinguish the real user from the clones.	13	17	0	14	0	0	0	0	0

There are now four rings of clones flowing around the target that move in complete unison with each other; like a large-scale ballet with the possibility of the user being in any of them and being any distance up to the fourth ring, attacking from any direction. Nearly the culmination of the Moon Dancer style, the innermost and the third ring go in one direction, and the second and the outermost ring go in the other direction.- Go Ten Kyohaku Mai (Five-Point Star Dance)Requirements: Hinoiri no MaiDescription: Considered to be the greatest legacy of Shado's technique by itself. There is now a fourth clone with the other three clones and the user surrounding the target in a star formation. The four clones are not translucent anymore, so determining the real one becomes particularly hard. All four clones, naturally, become solid while attacking for that split second. If the opponent guesses the wrong clone to be the user, and has not put up a defense before this, this technique will almost guarantee some sort of heavy injury.	25	26	24	19	0	17	0	0	0
954	7	7	Dances of the Sun and Moon	Santsuki no Mai		4	5			Special Technique requirements: Intelligence 26, Tactics 25, Willpower 24- Gesshoku no Mai (Dance of the Lunar Eclipse)Requirements: Aoi TsukiDescription: Considered to be the greatest legacy of Tokoshi's technique by itself. Five circles surround the target. The user is impossible to identify. The clones now move so fast and so well that they don't even appear as clones anymore, just five solid streams circling the user at remarkable speeds. If the target has not attempted some sort of defense before this jutsu is activated, a sword attack is almost guaranteed to connect some part of the body and, in some cases, do fatal damage. On the downside, an exact body part cannot be targeted, but the chest and stomach regions are the most likely areas to hit.	33	35	31	23	0	21	0	0	0
953	1	1	Inuzuka Taijutsu	None	Dog Support: As the beginning stage of training, the Inuzuka has just begun his training in being synchronized with his pet. They clearly understand each other on the battlefield and can share information through sound (ie. Commands and barking). The beast's senses are superior to his master's and can be used to track someone as well as act as a warning for certain dangers. At this stage the pet can just bark and attack but no fancy tactics.Claws and Fangs: The Inuzuka just began working on his sharpened claws. While they can't do much harm at this level, they can serve as a substitute for weapons only having basic movement; nothing beyond what normal nails could do.Enhanced Smelling: The Inuzuka developed their sense of smell just like that of a dog's. If the Inuzuka gets close enough to less than 10 feet of their opponent, they can keep track of their opponent's smell with the help of their pet companion.	5	4		Shikyaku (Four Legged)Description: The Inuzuka clan has studied the movements of dogs and move just like them on their legs. This technique oddly manipulates the human body to allow legs to bend in certain ways not normally seen by man. After training in this stance, the user becomes accustomed to staying on all fours. In this crouched position the user is able to strike low and fast, while also retaining a low center of gravity. The user uses unconventional means of attacking with fast open-clawed slashes and debilitating, gut-busting elbows. Within this stance, the legs provide power and speed, while the actual attacks from the arms and sometimes even vicious bites.Tsuuga I (Piercing Fang)Description: A signature attack of the Inuzuka clan, this technique involves either the dog or the human to spin rapidly. The resulting force looks like a mini-hurricane of sorts in which the user is spinning and using his claws and fangs to "tear" into the opponent. This technique's damage is entirely dependent on the user's Strength but will inflict various cuts and scrapes upon the point of impact as well. This insane frenzy is powerful, but only if it manages to hit the opponent. Therein lies the weakness of the attack. The practitioner is unable to see, let alone use any senses at this point, so it is highly advised to gain a good look of your target's location before performing.	Owner Jutsu: Juujin Bunshin no Jutsu (Beast Man Clone Technique)Requirement: Power 2, Control 2Description: One of the signature techniques for the Inuzuka, this jutsu requires that the beasts be in contact with their human counterpart. After forming the appropriate seals, the two species will begin to transform into a hybrid between the two. Man becomes more bestial with larger fangs, sharper nails, and a more canine anatomy. Although not overly dramatic, this allows the human to become much more feral. In contrast, the beast(s) will have a much more drastic transformation. The dog fully transforms into a human shape, yet still retains their own personal makeup. This essentially creates two similar creatures where beast and human cannot be distinguished. The dog retains their own stats, however.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
953	2	2	Inuzuka Taijutsu	None	Dog Support: The pet has become used to the life as a shinobi and now is a precious aid on the battlefield. The pet can jump and follow his master's movements easily which allows a better coordination in attacks, such as carrying items and retrieving items. The item can be small, such as projectile, or medium sized, such as a katana. If the pet learned the Juujin Bunshin technique, the coordination is pretty impressive. The pet can dig holes to hide inside and prepare for a surprise attack.Claws and Fangs: The Inuzuka can cut the skin of their victims easily now and even take off a bit of flesh with vicious and clear hits.Enhanced Hearing: Just like the dogs, the Inuzuka develops an animalistic hearing which enables them to focus more easily on their opponent's movements. This is not super hearing but would make an Inuzuka harder to be caught off guard.	5	4		Tsuuga II (Piercing Fang)Description: Not Much has changed in the technique other than possibly attacking faster with more precision, but nothing close to perfect. The hectic rotation of the attack naturally hinders many of the senses, but at this time the user gains a knowledge of how to utilize other senses to home in on their target more. Although still unable to truly be effective, the user has a better idea of where the target is using their scent of smell. However, the user must recognize the target's scent prior to attacking.Gatsuuga (Double Piercing Fang)Requirements: Both master and pet must know this techniqueDescription: This is a more advanced and deadly version of the Tsuuga attack. Before, only one of the companions was able to attack at once, but now they are able to attack at the same time, increasing the overall damage as well as anything else that may apply. The Inuzuka and his dog are able to aim this attack after they have begun by using smell as well, increasing the chance for a double hit, the rules for Tsuuga apply to this as well.		7	7	0	0	0	0	6	0	0
953	3	3	Inuzuka Taijutsu	None	Dog Support: The synchronization between beast and human allow for a better attack. The pet can urinate on the opponent to blind him if it lands in his eyes or just urinate on them to keep track of their opponent anywhere they may go on the battlefield. The pet is the only one who can track the opponent in such a fashion. The pet can also identify traps.Claws and Fangs: The user's claws have developed enough strength and durability to combat against double edged kunai as well as tantos. Amazingly enough, these natural weapons are becoming so formidable that they can even begin tearing flesh clear off of opponents.Enhanced Senses: At this stage, the Inuzuka is now at a level that only the most highly-trained, normal shinobi could achieve in terms of smelling and hearing. While still in the realm a normal ninja could sense, they are advanced enough that most shinobi could only barely be able to feel.	5	4		Tsuuga III (Piercing Fang)Description: There hasn't been that much of an improvement. At this stage in the game, the practitioner has learned to rotate their bodies at greater speeds without losing stability or precision. Their senses are still no where near perfect, but if the user marks the target with a noticeable and distinct scent, they are better able to target an opponent.	Beast Jutsu: Tei Douteki Saiten (Air Dynamic Marking)Requirements: Power 7, Control 7, Reserves 6Description: A very comical, yet effective jutsu none the less, the canine counterpart aims with its genitals and sprays its urine onto the opponent. The reasoning behind this makes up for the fact that it only seems like a joke. If this urine enters any open orifice (cuts, mouth, eyes), it burns much like acid, causing a fair amount of pain. The only real way to get rid of the painful and disgusting fluid is too wash it away with water. This jutsu is very useful for the Tsuuga attack due to the fact that it marks opponents with a very strong, pungent odor.	10	10	0	0	0	0	8	0	0
953	4	4	Inuzuka Taijutsu	None	Dog Support: The dog and master are now practically one. When the dog is at this level, he can communicate incredibly well with his master. It is the basic equivalent of mental communication, though not as perfect as telepathy. The dog is just able to project his/her emotions and feelings through certain movements and body posture, and the master will be able to understand instantly, even if the dog is far away.Claws and Fangs: The claws are now strong enough to counter weapons such as a Katana and the like. The claws have become a powerful asset of the Inuzuka.Enhanced Senses: This is when the senses of the Inuzuka leaves the realm of humans and enters the canine world. The Inuzuka's senses are nowhere near as good as a dog's yet, but he is slowly getting there.	5	4		Tsuuga IV (Piercing Fang)Description: The Tsuuga has improved greatly with more accuracy and more precision. With practice, the user has increased their speed and velocity essentially allowing the diameter of the attack to expand a foot or so from their own arm length. Targeting the opponent is still just as difficult however. Although their senses have been enhanced, the pure speed of the attack only allows for scents to give a general direction if the opponent chooses to move.Tsuuga Rendan (Piercing Fang Combo)Requirements: Both master and pet must know this technique.Description: This jutsu requires the opponent's approval before it can be implemented. Utilizing the idea of Gatsuuga in a new method, the canine or Inuzuka attack the opponent with a regular Tsuuga. Once they finish, the other partner follows up with a Tsuuga as well. It is in this method that the combo can continue. One has the time to recover, while the other strikes again, thus creating a continuous whirlwind of damage. The first two hits with this technique are fine. However, to continue attacking with the Tsuuga Rendan, opponent permission must be given to have a combo attack. The rules for Tsuuga apply to this technique.X SlashRequirements: Both master and pet must know this techniqueDescription: Quite simply, the dog and his master run up to the opponent and at the last moment, they switch position performing an X slash with their claws. The technique often surprises the opponent and can clearly change the tides of a battle. It is a simple tactic yet useful.		15	15	13	0	0	0	14	0	0
953	5	5	Inuzuka Taijutsu	None	Dog Support: This aspect of the dog has not changed from the previous stage.Claws and Fangs: Now strong enough to even compete with the strength of cleaver swords, the natural weapons of the Inuzuka are quite deadly.Enhanced Senses: The Inuzuka now has the complete senses of a dog, though there is a slight problem. The Inuzuka also has the senses of a human, such as better vision and a kind of chakra sense that shinobi all have, but cannot use these human senses at the same time as his canine ones. Switching between the two senses takes a single post.	5	4		Tsuuga V (Piercing Fang)Description: No changes.		21	21	14	0	0	0	16	0	0
953	6	6	Inuzuka Taijutsu	None	Dog Support: The union between dog and master is now only a few steps away from perfection. The only thing that keeps them away from being the perfect combination is the fact that they must be together to be able to fight in such a magnificent combination of instinctual movement and attack. Communication between the two is no longer needed, for they already know what the other would do. The only problem with this is that the two must be together. If the master and dog cannot sense each other at all, this synchrony is gone entirely.Claws and Fangs: This aspect of the Inuzuka and dogs have not changed at all.Enhanced Senses: The problem of the previous stage is now gone, though not completely. The Inuzuka can effortlessly switch between the two senses, but cannot keep them both going at the same time.	5	4		Tsuuga VI (Piercing Fang)Description: Probably the fiercest the most vicious the Tsuuga is going to get, the user is able to expand the radius of their attack by an extra foot, creating a very intimidating tornado of claws and fangs. Targeting the opponent is still difficult, but at this time if the user compared their sense of smell during this attack, to their vision, it would be like wearing very blurry glasses. The user knows where the opponent is through their sense of smell, but fails in comparison to their normal enhanced senses. This does not however mean that the user can absolutely attack the target, but with their senses paired with the sheer speed and power of this technique, it grows increasingly difficult to avoid being hit.	Sou Tou Rou (Double Headed Wolf)Requirements: Power 19 , Control 19, Reserves 18 + User must spend two jutsu points for this special technique.Description: A special combination jutsu of the Inuzuka. The Inuzuka and his canine companion combine together after making physical contact to create this rather large and deadly beast. This technique is the final stepping stone for an Inuzuka clan member, and is used as a last resort technique for the most part. After combining, the two become one in the form of a extremely large two headed wolf, the appearance factor is dependent on the canine counterparts fur color, facial features, etc. This jutsu can be maintained for four posts. Once this jutsu is used, the Sou Tou Rou gains +5 to all physical stats, but once this jutsu runs out the canine and Inuzuka will be completely exhausted and unable to continue battle.Garouga (Double Wolf Fang)Requirements: Power 19, Control 19, Reserves 18 (The master and pet must be in Sou Tou Rou form)Description: The Garouga is a jutsu which takes the teachings upon which Tsuuga and Gatsuuga are based upon and improves them to an insane level. This technique is only able to be performed after combining into a SouTouRou. Performing the jutsu like one would a Tsuuga, a giant vortex of pure feral rage and strength is created, this jutsu is regarded as the trump card of many Inuzuka. The giant vortex is extremely large, but at the same time it makes the Sou Tou Rou blind, making them either strike at random or rely on their sense of smell to follow their opponent if he has been covered in the canine's urine. The radius of this jutsu alone is fifty feet, and within twenty feet outside of this radius excruciating gashes can be caused due to the massive shockwaves caused, making it truly a deadly jutsu. The rules for Tsuuga apply to this technique.	30	30	15	0	0	0	18	18	0
953	7	7	Inuzuka Taijutsu	None	Dog Support: The mastery of the spiritual bond between an animal and man has been reached. There can be no further development in one's body or mind. The canine and Inuzuka clan member are now one, able to react to each other's movements merely on instinct alone; they have become a duo able to take down the most skilled of ninja. This level of power is usually only attainable by the clan head, and as such, it brings with it a level of fame and fear unimaginable otherwise.Claw and Fang: Utilizing quick dashes and powerful strikes with any part of the body, the Inuzuka is now a walking weapon of mass destruction. The fearsome strength of the claws and fangs of the user only enhances their destructive ability. Only steel and enhanced objects can stop the sharp strike of claw or bite of fang.Enhanced Senses: Perfect combination. The sense of a dog and the sense of a human are now combined within the Inuzuka so much so that the Inuzuka can easily keep both going at the same time, though he can choose to turn off one or the other to have a better feel for either.	5	4		Tsuuga VII (Piercing Fang)Description: No changes.	Cerberus RoarRequirements: Power 26, Control 25, Reserves 24 (The Inuzuka and his dog must be in Sou Tou Rou form)Description: The pinnacle of skill and talent for the Inuzuka, this technique is the perfect set-up for the devilishly terrible attack, Garouga. Once in the SouTouRou form, with either two to four heads (dependent upon amount of dogs), the users will combine all their sheer power to perform a devious roar. The roar coming from the Cerberus is so terrible that it can paralyze anybody in a 20 feet radius, which makes this hit an extremely lethal one and sure to land. The best bet of the person to escape this terrible combo would be to have a teammate ready to help him get out of the way. Being paralyzed lasts for 1 post, regardless of rank or stats.	40	40	19	0	0	0	22	22	0
950	1	1	Aburame Bug Contracts	None	KikaiThe Aburame is barely joined with his kikai, having only recently bonded with them. None of the bugs specialized abilities are yet available to him, save only the ability to consume chakra, since that is a part of the kikai's natural food process.CommunicationThe young Aburame is just beginning to learn how to effectively communicate with his kikai. His commands are limited to simple, one or two word statements. He is also unable to isolate a single insect to give commands. All instructions are passed on to the entire colony, so the Aburame must be very careful about what he or she instructs them to do. The maximum range that the Aburame can communicate with the kikai is 10 meters.AbilitiesWhen the Aburame first starts his training, he learns to be able to manipulate the bugs around him, telling them to take positions in certain areas and using their skill of analysis to understand the way the opponent's body moves.EvolutionsNone.						0	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	4
950	2	2	Aburame Bug Contracts	None	KikaiThe kikai have begun to evolve into two separate castes, a warrior and a worker caste. The warriors have developed specialized mandibles that are capable of inflicting painful bites upon a victim, besides having the ability to feed off the victim's chakra. The workers have not developed any special traits, their role is simply to help keep the warriors running while they are away from the Aburame.CommunicationThe Aburame is now bonded enough with his kikai to use simple sentences to command them. He is also able to divide instructions between two groups of bugs, emaning he can isolate one bug, if desired, or can give special instructions to a larger group of kikai. Maximum range has increased to 20 meters.AbilitiesHaving the larger communication range, the Aburame is able to position bugs in much wider varieties without the opponent being able to detect them. From previous training they are able to control the kikai to separate from being the form of a kunai before they reach their target, being able to plant kikai in certain places or have them just leap onto the opponent they are aimed at. They are also able to use them as tools to help them climb, float on water and other useful things.					Carapace I - This evolution allows the kikai to expend a slight amount of Chakra to enhance the chitin of their exoskeletons. While it doesn't grant invulnerability, it can protect the bugs from Level One Strength attacks as well as Stage One Ninjutsu. Once activated, this can last for five posts (either consecutive or broken up in a thread).	0	0	0	0	4	0	6	0	8
950	3	3	Aburame Bug Contracts	None	KikaiAs the Aburame has bonded more with the kikai, the bugs have come to adapt more specific roles for themselves. The warriors have not evolved any further at this stage. The workers, however, by aiding in the function of the Aburame's bodily systems, are able to speed natural healing a bit and keep their hosts alive when they might otherwise bleed to death. So far, they are incapable of neutralizing poisons, though.CommunicationThe Aburame can now send images to their kikai to help in communicating instructions, though they are still limited to simple sentences for verbal communication. He or she may also divide the insects into three groups now, and the maximum range has increased to 30 meters.AbilitiesThe kikai have become a large enough colony at this level, that they are able to join together to form a large object, such as a single clone of the Aburame, or any person. Alternatively, the kikai may be used to form several smaller objects, such a handful of shuriken. The created clone has 1/4 physical Stats of the Aburame (bonuses included).					Devour - This evolution enhances the mandibles of the kikai, coating them with a corrosive substance they are immune to. The insects are now capable of ripping and tearing something apart, digesting it bit by bit and converting it into Chakra for their own sustenance. Soft materials like leaves and paper can instantly be chewed up but materials like metal and stone take hours or days, depending on the size and density of the object.	0	0	0	0	8	0	10	0	10
950	4	4	Aburame Bug Contracts	None	KikaiA third type of kikai has evolved, a sort of hybrid between the warrior and worker classes. This insect has enough knowledge of the human processes to actually subvert them. This is done by secreting a chemical that numbs the muscles slightly, slowing the heart rate and making movement difficult. This serves a dual purpose. Obviously, the kikai can secrete their chemical into an enemy and impede his combat effectiveness. However, the kikai can use the chemical on their own masters to slow the flow of blood, and the spread of any poison, keeping them alive for days when they would usually die within hours.CommunicationThe Aburame is now able to use complex sentences in giving orders. He is able to separate his kikai into up to four groups, and now has a 40-meter radius communication distance. Also, he is able to have limited communication with insects other than kikai, though this is limited to two word commands.AbilitiesAfter a great deal of study, the bond between Aburame and Kikai has increased a substantial amount allowing more commands to be taken into effect. The Aburame has learned to control the kikai in such a way as to drain chakra from their opponents, which can be transferred into the Aburame's inner coils, for use by himself or by the kikai currently inside his body.					Homing Beacon - Within the kikai species are male and female genders. While the males are fairly ordinary, the females can emit a scent detectable only by other kikai; not even the famed noses of the Inuzuka could pick it up. The bugs can pinpoint the location of the smell and follow the trail back to the female. This makes for an extremely effective tracking method if the Aburame manages to plant a female insect somewhere on the body of their target.Camouflage I - Exerting what little Chakra they have in their bodies, the kikai can adjust the colour of their exoskeleton to blend in with the surrounding environment. The camouflage is hardly perfect since when they move, they cannot blend quickly enough to keep up with the setting while the buzzing of their wings gives them away all too easily. Even when stationary the disguise is flawed; every so often a patch of bugs will flicker in and out of the camouflage. This can be activated for four posts with a two post cooldown.Carapace II (requires Carapace I) - Building upon the foundations of the previous technique, the critters are able to harden their natural armour to an even greater extent and can endure attacks of Level Three Strength and Stage Three Ninjutsu. Once activated, this can last for four posts (either consecutive or broken up in a thread).	0	0	0	0	14	0	15	13	15
950	5	5	Aburame Bug Contracts	None	KikaiThe worker caste kikai have evolved even further, by this time. They have such a good knowledge of the Aburame's anatomy that they are able to classify most poisons and concoct an antidote. This antidote is then dispersed into the bloodstream, healing the Aburame in a matter of minutes. It takes at least 3 posts for the kikai to analyze the poison and another post for the antidote to take effect.CommunicationAt this level of bonding with the kikai, the Aburame is able to establish a direct link into the mind of a single insect. He is able to see through the eyes of the kikai, the line of thought being transmitted much like a video stream. The Aburame is not able to transmit thoughts in this way, however. His instructions still rely on verbal orders and images. Up to five groups may be formed, and the maximum distance has increased to 50 meters.AbilitiesMass producing clones, weapons, and the like has now become second nature to the Aburame. He is now fully able to produce up to three clones of himself (or others), as well as a full set of kunai, or one or two larger weapons. The kikai colony has become a fully-fledged army at this level. The created clones only have 1/4 of the physical stats of the Aburame (bonuses included).					Camouflage II (requires Camouflage I) - Simply an upgrade of the previous, this improvement makes the camouflage passable. The kikai can now blend well enough to keep up with movement and no longer flicker; the buzzing of flight is muffled as best as possible but the more there are the easier it is to notice. When stationary the kikai are nearly invisible to the naked eye; in motion, the air looks like it ripples wherever they move. This can be activated for three posts with a two post cooldown.	0	0	0	0	16	0	20	16	20
950	6	6	Aburame Bug Contracts	None	KikaiThe warrior kikai have started to evolve again. Using the knowledge of human anatomy gleaned by the worker caste, they have manufactured a poison gland of their own, and are able to inject it into whatever body they are attacking. This poison acts upon the inner coils and the nervous system, making it exceedingly difficult both for the victim to mold chakra and to react and move quickly. This poison generally takes three posts to take effect after being administered. (Unless treated by an upper-chuunin level medical nin.)CommunicationThe Aburame is now able to transmit live thoughts to his kikai, giving them the ability to act as a sort of personal recorder. This also cuts down severely on the complexity of giving orders to different groups of kikai. The Aburame may now form up to six different groups and his communication distance is limited to 60 meters. Finally, the Aburame may now communicate, through simple sentences, with any type of insect.AbilitiesThe kikai have reached a point of unity that they are actually able to use some jutsu. They must be in a clone shape in order to form seals. By each of them contributing a bit of chakra, they are able to use jutsu from one list known by their masters (must be specified), up to stage 3. The clones' physical stats however are now only 1/3 of the Aburame's (bonuses included).					Detector - The kikai have the inherent ability to detect the presence of Chakra, although it is on such a minuscule scale that it's often negligible. With this technique, though, the kikai become able to pick up the trace of Chakra no matter how well it is being suppressed so long as the body of Chakra comes within five feet of them.Drain - Utilizing the property most feared in the kikai, this technique allows the bugs to feed off the Chakra of an external source and transfer it back to the user. While in great amounts this does provide an invigorating boost both mentally and physically, the Chakra provided goes straight into the user's reserves. Essentially the user can regain jutsu usages in a thread, but it is proportionate to the amount of time the kikai spend leeching Chakra. For every post the swarm remains feeding off a source, the Aburame regains one use to all of his jutsu in a single Ninjutsu or Genjutsu list (excluding the Celestial Gates and the Universal Puppet List) to the corresponding stage once they return. Conversely, the target being drained loses usages to the kikai in the same manner.Carapace III (requires Carapace II) - At this point, the kikai exoskeleton is as sturdy as it's ever going to get, barring odd scientific experimentation. The kikai can now survive even Level Five Strength attacks and Stage Five Ninjutsu. Once activated, this can last for three posts (either consecutive or broken up in a thread).	0	0	0	0	18	18	25	24	26
950	7	7	Aburame Bug Contracts	None	KikaiThe worker kikai have gained an enormous amount of knowledge about the Aburame's body. They are able to manipulate cell growth in order to rapidly heal wounds, as well as cure poisons within two posts. The warrior's poison has become more potent, able to afflict the victim a single post after being introduced into the bloodstream. (Unless treated by a medical nin of at least beginning jounin level.)CommunicationThe Aburame is now capable of totally perfect communication with his kikai, able to form up to seven separate groups with different instructions, and able to transmit thoughts up to 70 meters away. He is also able to carry on full conversations with other insects, limited only by the mental capacity of the insects themselves.AbilitiesThe kikai are now capable of performing some of the higher level jutsu (up to stage four) from one list known by the Aburame (the list must be specified). The clones' physical stats however are now only 1/3 of the Aburame's (bonuses included).						0	0	0	0	22	22	33	33	33
949	1	1	Gentle Fist	Jyuuken	At this stage, the user is capable to perform the basic Jyuuken stance, and attack with simple kicks and punches. The emphasis is placed on insight already; how to block an attack and counter it. Steady aiming is important as well; how to make your hit at the exact spot you wanted it to land.Physical power and/or speed are not important at this stage, nor are athletics. Learning patience, control and style is what matters most here. Reaction speed will also be tested greatly, and will increase in beginning users of Jyuuken. At this point, the point of the style is learning. The terms of offense and defense are downplayed whereas growth and experience are promoted.		5	4			0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
949	2	2	Gentle Fist	Jyuuken	Not far off from the last stage, this level of Jyuuken places an emphasis on countering and follow-ups. Anticipating an opponent's movements are key alongside practicing how to use them to one's benefit. Flowing with an attack rather than withstanding it begins to take form in every movement. Dodging, too, becomes beneficial. Though at this stage the user is not conditioned enough to fully predict and evade attacks with as much precision as later levels.Offensively, there have been a few changes. The ability to pinpoint areas of attack is still stressed, though now it's less about finding an opening because at this point the user is hopefully able to put their bloodline to use and deliver chakra-based attacks. With this new key weapon in their arsenal, most Hyuugas quickly develop a short list of vital points to attack such as the chest and ribs to fully deliver their deadly punches.		5	4		Hakkeshou Nankan (Hand of the Eight Divinations: Barrier)Requirement: JyuukenType: Taijutsu; Defensive/PassiveDescription: When an opponent is within the closest ranges of the Hakke, the user of this technique begins to excrete a small amount of chakra from the tenketsus at a steady rate. By doing this the user is able to heighten their reflexes. This technique increases both the defensive and offensive capabilities of Jyuuken attacks by speeding up the users natural reaction time significantly. In a manner of speaking, it is a barrier that alerts the user of motion way before the motion reaches the user, a heightened sense of movement. Unlike the Hakkeshou Kaiten, this technique requires much less chakra and doesn't provide an offensive strike, but more of a preemptive strike. It is said that this technique was created to answer the Sharingan's ability to copy and counter taijutsu techniques.	0	8	6	0	0	0	0	6	0
949	3	3	Gentle Fist	Jyuuken	At this level, the Jyuuken user drastically improves in speed. The ability to counter attacks and interpret movements was already exceptional, but coupled now with lightning-fast reflexes makes the user a terrible thing to behold in battle. Most attacks can be instantly reversed, altered, and combinations of counters can be situated. The user learns the second basic stance here, but will usually stick to the primary one (it is as of yet practical in usage and unusable). However, punches, kicks, and palm strikes are still a Hyuuga's main weapon. The variety of offensive maneuvers they are later feared for are not yet fully-developed.The user begins to learn a bit about the body of the enemy here, finding out where to hit to make it matter. Tactical insight drastically increases, combined with the aforementioned increase in speed to finalize the Jyuuken basics reached at the end of the second stage.		5	4		Hakkeshou Sekishokyuu (Hand of the Eight Divinations: Barrier Sphere)Requires: Jyuuken, Hakkeshou NankanType: Taijutsu; DefensiveDescription: A prelude to the Hakkeshou Kaiten, this technique makes most use out of chakra control. As through the learning tree, a Hyuuga must first learn the Hakkeshou Nankan to use this technique, borrowing from the basic principle of chakra expulsion in mass amounts. This technique, though, makes further use of that method but releases a mass amount of chakra in one blast, excreting it from all the tenketsus much like in the Hakkeshou Kaiten. Then, any opponent caught within its blast, which cannot exceed more than Ã‚Â½ a meter, is instantly stalled, stopped mid-attack or movement. Same goes for projectiles such as kunais or shuriken. But, the major flaw of this technique, is that it does absolutely nothing against ninjutsu. Also, since the spin is not used in this technique, the amount of chakra to be used to gain this effect is larger than in Kaiten.Note: Can be used three times in one thread.Hakkeshou Inasu (Hand of the Eight Divinations: Parry)Requires: Hakkeshou NankanType: Taijutsu; DefensiveDescription: The counterattack is a concept well-known to all taijutsu specialists. To most it consists of a two-step process: recognize an attack then move to act against it. Yet to the Hyuuga, and through Jyuuken, the counterattack is measured by a different method. First using the Byakugan, the Hyuuga is able to perceive the attack. Then using Hakkeshou Nankan, they are further able to feel it. The third step is this technique. Manipulating the Nankan so that chakra creates a 'soft' obstacle, the Hyuuga is able to divert an incoming attack if by only a few inches. This can mean the difference between a simple cut and a fatal gash. With experience, a Hyuuga can even apply this technique to opposing taijutsus.Note: Divert =/= redirect at your opponent. Divert =/= aim an attack at another person. Etc etc. Divert translates into being able to safely alter an attacks course by, at most, 15cm (6in). Only taijutsu attacks can be diverted, as wells, though the primary use for this is against projectiles.	0	12	8	0	0	0	0	8	0
949	4	4	Gentle Fist	Jyuuken	The fourth stage of Jyuuken shows an increase in agility and speed. The user begins to use more athletic combat moves; back flips, nimble dodges, all part of the regular arsenal. Take into account that Jyuuken's second stance becomes available here and you have a devastating array of maneuvers. Most importantly, though, this is the point where the user begins to learn to attack with his/her fingertips. Hitting tenketsu becomes regular business at this stage, though it still might prove fairly difficult to land perfect hits.At this point the user is vastly aware of their surroundings at all times and the ability to react to attacks increases as well. The fourth ring in the Field of Hakke suddenly becomes available to Hyuuga at this stage but most are unaware of its true potential. In effect, it serves to only increase their Byakugan's effective combat range and perception.Also of note is the strength of each individual palm and finger strike. Though previously not very powerful at all, this stage makes it so that the user is finally accustomed to both their body and bloodline in such a way that full force and effect is possible. The short of it is: their attacks are now both externally and internally damaging.		5	4		Opening Point AttacksRequirement: Admin Approval + Clan Owner ApprovalType: Taijutsu; OffensiveDescription: Performed by a genius among the Hyuuga. It allows the Byakugan user to see the chakra openings (Tsubos) and strike them with enough accuracy to close them - stopping or increasing the flow of chakra. The holes are found from the 361 pressure points in the Inner Coil System (Tenketsu).Hakkeshou Kaiten (Hand of the Eight Divinations: Heavenly Spin)Requirements: Hakkeshou Nankan + Hakkeshou SekishokyuuType: Taijutsu; Defensive (contextual)Description: Another of the 'perfect defense' jutsu types. At the exact moment a blow is landed on the body, large amounts of chakra are expelled from the tenketsu around the body. With that force in place, his body then begins to spin like a top. The combined efforts of the chakra and the spin, first deflect the attack- then throw the opponent backwards. The radius of this defense is 10m.Note: When blocking/deflecting physical attacks, the user must have a combined speed and stamina greater than or equal to the opponent's strength and stamina. Likewise with ninjutsu, the user must have a combined speed and stamina greater than or equal to the opponent's power and control in order to block/deflect an attack.Hakke Rokujuu Yonshou (Hand of the Eight Divinations: 64 Hands)Requirements: Opening Point Attacks + Player ApprovalType: Taijutsu; OffensiveDescription: Using a highly advanced form of Byakugan, the user is able to see the tenketsu on a person's body and, using Jyuuken's advanced maneuvers, closes them with quick blows, stopping the flow of chakra through one's body. In total there are 64 consecutive strikes made upon the opponent and renders their chakra system completely useless for the remainder of the battle (thread).Note: The physical strength of each blow is the user's own strength.	11	19	13	0	0	0	0	14	0
949	5	5	Gentle Fist	Jyuuken	The advanced level of Jyuuken, the user here increases in physical power and speed, and has come to a point of ability in which the tenketsus are all known by heart, dozens of tactics have been studied, and counters have been made for most types of assaults. Long-distance combat, the bane of any taijutsu user, can't even be considered a weakness to most Hyuugas. With the ability to close large distances in a matter of moments and with even greater nimbleness than seen thus far, Jyuuken users are only more reputable.The Field of Hakke is now fully accessible. The user is able to 'feel' whatever is within the field with great precision. This sense of knowing, however, is pure deception. The field is simply utilized by the Byakugan and only further enhanced by the user's now-stunning prowess. Agility provides a measure against every form of attack while speed and a growing strength afford the user the ability to exploit any weakness caught within their field of vision. Most do not know this, but the Field of Hakke only dictates the effective combat range of a Hyuuga, both defensively and offensively. This is quite separate from a Hyuuga's line of sight.The greatest addition here is the insight to step into attacks. Even when the opponent is not attacking, this level of Jyuuken allows the user to get the enemy into a situation where he'd be forced to fight the Jyuuken user in his defensive stance. A very likeable style starts to show here, because even when attacking, the prime aspect is defense. On another note, the user also starts to use less kicks here, keeping himself more on the ground.		5	4		Opening Point AttacksRequirement: Clan Owner ApprovalType: Taijutsu; OffensiveDescription: At this stage, the tenketsu are taught to a Hyuuga rather than discovered through natural talent. It allows the Byakugan user to see the chakra openings (Tsubos) and strike them with enough accuracy to close them - stopping or increasing the flow of chakra. The holes are found from the 361 pressure points in the Inner Coil System (Tenketsu).Hakke Hyaku Niju Hashou (Hand of the Eight Divinations: 128 Hands)Requirement: Hakke Rokujuu Yonshou + Player ApprovalType: Taijutsu; OffensiveDescription: Much like the technique leading up to it but even more impressive. Taking up a peculiar stance, the user focuses their mind and opens up the fourth ring in the Field of Hakke (based on the doujutsu's field of vision), allowing their Byakugan to absorb all the information of everything within it with frightening accuracy. At this point the user's overall attack speed increases dramatically and allows them to fire volleys of palm/finger strikes and kicks at an opponent in mere seconds. The end result is an attack consisting of 128 strikes that are aimed to completely shut down an opponent's chakra system and render them incapable of recovery for a few weeks.Note: Speed is increased by one level for the duration of this technique. The strength of each blow is equal to the user's own strength. After this technique is used, the user's speed is decreased by one level for one post.	16	24	16	0	0	0	0	16	0
949	6	6	Gentle Fist	Jyuuken	Another healthy increase to the superb fighting skills of any Hyuuga, this stage only serves as a stepping stone to the next. Yet far and apart are those who make it to this stage and those who make it to the next. Only the most brilliant and talented have ever surpassed this stage, and they have been no less than legends even amongst the Hyuuga.In this stage we come across both devastating strength and unmatchable speed; a combination that is difficult to contest. Stamina is increased as well, allowing the user to practice and perform their techniques for long periods of time, honing their skills to the utmost. In all, the user has come to a state of near-perfection physically. Fitness is not the sole concern of the Hyuuga, though. There is still the same emphasis on the ability to see attacks and organize counterattacks as well as methods of escape. Yet here, the user has conditioned themself to the point where any attack made upon their person is either easily dealt with or even preemptively halted.This is because the Byakugan has developed in such a way that it allows the user to notice all the minute details of a person's anatomy. A muscle twitching into motion, chakra being gathered in a particular part of the body, and so on and so forth: these are things the user of Jyuuken has knowledge of. Even nerve impulse, that is physical reflexes, are seen as if in slow motion and taken into account with a Hyuuga at this level.		5	4		Hakke Kuushou (Hand of the Eight Divinations: Wind Palm)Requirement: Hakkeshou SekishokyuuType: Taijutsu; OffensiveDescription: A fantastic attack that literally pushes the range of any Hyuuga to the brink. In this technique, the user simply positions themselves in the same way they would if they were to attack someone right in front of them. But instead, they thrust their palms out in the direction of their opponent and release chakra in short bursts. These bursts become almost like bullets of air and ram into opponents who are too far away for the Hyuuga to immediately reach.Note: The strength of each attack is that of the user's strength, and the range is limited to their furthest range of Hakke (15m).Hakkeshou Daikaiten (Hand of the Eight Divinations: Grand Heavenly Spin)Requirement: Kaiten, Clan Owner ApprovalType: Defensive (contextual)Description: A stronger form of Kaiten that can only be used by the most skilled of the Hyuuga (and formerly only by the main family). It has a much greater radius than its predecessor, stretching as far as 25m in radius*Note: Maximum effect can only be achieved twice a thread. When blocking/deflecting physical attacks, the user must have a combined speed and stamina greater than or equal to the opponent's strength and stamina. Likewise with ninjutsu, the user must have a combined speed and stamina greater than or equal to the opponent's power and control in order to block/deflect an attack.	21	32	22	0	0	0	0	20	16
949	7	7	Gentle Fist	Jyuuken	The final level of Jyuuken where power and speed both massively increase. The user evolves into a state of near perfection, possible to use offense as defense, and vice versa, to an extent that is nearly impossible to break through. Physical power drastically increases, making finger point strikes lethal enough to break bones and disrupt organs, even without the use of additional chakra.The user, however, will mostly stand still and await attacks while in this stance, except during times when one of the specific techniques is used. The reason of this is simple; attacking is no longer necessary in a one on one battle. The Jyuuken user is nearly impossible to hit at this level, and can counter close to anything at blinding speed, and with incredible force. Victory is almost always a certainty.		5	4			25	40	32	0	0	0	0	24	22
958	1	1	Fire Element: One	Katon: Ichi	Type: Ninjutsu The basic building block of a great many techniques down the line, this is presumably the very same skill that began the study of Katons. Molding their chakra through a simple seal of any choice, the user is able to focus it onto the tip of their index finger in the form of heat. With this, they can cut through things such as glass and rope with some difficulty. However, at this stage, control of one's chakra is so minimal that this technique can only be used by one finger and essentially has no combat use.														
958	1	2	Fire Element: Flare Technique	Katon: Shoumeidan no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu By molding chakra into ones lungs properly, they are able to exhale a short burst of heat and flame which basically explodes from the mouth. The fire itself actually only lasts for about a second. But its effect is that it illuminates dark places, if only for but a few seconds.														
958	1	3	Fire Element: Shuriken Technique	Katon: Shuriken no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A relatively basic katon, this one uses chakra to coat a metal shuriken or a kunai with fire. It is done so that the user first throws the shuriken, then exhales from his or her mouth a small flame that ignites the chakra-coated projectile. If the attack succeeds, not only will your opponent be hurt by the shuriken or kunai, but he will also suffer from burns. Note: Only one projectile at a time.														
958	1	4	Fire Element: Veil Technique	Katon: Fukumen no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A stall technique which really only helps genins in this stage of learning accustom themselves to the less subtle methods of Katons. Performing the necessary seals, the user claps their hand in front of them and a hot white flash erupts from their hands that blind people in the closest vicinities. With this opening, the user is able to make a hasty escape or even move in for a killing blow. The severity of the flash, however, lasts only a moment and causes only spots to appear until an opponent's sight becomes clear again. Note: Both the effect and the recovery from this technique can be overcome in one post.														
958	1	5	Fire Element: Cinder Technique	Katon: Tanebi no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Basic to all Katon users is the ability to set thing things on fire, obviously. This technique allows a person to snap their fingers and ignite a spark anywhere they so wish. A sparking cinder travels from their hand to their target, before going off at the destination. This jutsu is used mostly in pranks and the like. Base Effect: Can start up to two separate sparks. Stage Two Effect: Can start up to four separate sparks. Stave Three Effect: Can start up to six separate sparks, or one large spark that have the same effect as exploding pouches. Stage Four Effect: Can start up to eight separate sparks, or one large spark that has the same effect as an exploding tag (this ability can only be used twice in one thread).														
958	1	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 4, Tactics 4																
958	2	1	Fire Element: Two	Katon: Ni	Type: Ninjutsu This technique makes it so that after a user has molded enough chakra to gather heat into their finger they can now distribute it to both the index and middle finger (one hand), making it a somewhat viable option in combat now. However, jabs and strikes made through this method would simply burn through clothing and wouldn't cause any substantial thereafter. In terms of raw searing strength, though, it allows the user to cut through even metallic string now.														
958	2	2	Fire Element: Mythical Fire Flower Technique	Katon Housenka no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A jutsu that sends multiple, small blasts of fire from the mouth, usually with one target in mind. Shurikens can also be hidden inside the flames, creating an element of surprise. Base Effect: Can fire up to six separate volleys. Stage Three Effect: Can fire up to ten separate volley's, also able to mask projectile weaponry in each fireball. Stage Four Effect: Can fire up to fourteen separate volleys. Stage Five Effect: Can fire up to eighteen separate volleys.														
958	2	3	Fire Element: Flash Fan Technique	Katon: Hoteri Ougigata no Jutsu	Type: Ninjustu A fairly simple jutsu, the user breaths in a fair amount of air while performing the necessary handseals and breaths it out in a short funnel of flame. Literally lasting only a few seconds, it explodes out of the mouth in a v-like wave and is a commonly used technique amongst shinobi who like to build into their attacks. Not necessarily a viable offensive option as compared to other jutsus, but it does serve its purposes since only three handseals are needed to perform this technique. Base Effect: Range of the cone is 3m, but its damage is contained to 1st degree burns. Stage Three Effect: Range of the cone is 5m, and its damage extends to that of 2nd degree burns. Stage Four Effect: Range of the cone is 7m. Stage Five Effect: Range of the cone is 10m.														
958	2	4	Fire Element: Flame-Resistance Technique	Katon: Bounetsu no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu This is a passive jutsu that is the first in two steps to protect the user from damaging themselves with their very own Katons. Although not necessarily mandatory to learn the finer points of the tree, it does provide a buffer against self-inflicting injuries. For example the user is able to withstand increasing amounts of heat and can even withstand certain techniques aimed at them. Withstand, however, does not translate into invulnerability as there are general flaws to this jutsu as well. Note: Damage must be withstood realistically after this jutsu is used. Maximum two uses per thread. Base Effect: Can 'withstand' up to two Katons from Stage 2 and below. Stage Three Effect: Up to two Katons from Stage 3 and below. Stage Four Effect: Up to two Katons from Stage 4 and below. Stage Five Effect: Up to three Katons from Stage 4 and below, or a single Stage 5 technique.														
958	2	5	Fire Element: Ember Clone Technique	Katon: Yojin Bunshin no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A basic bunshin wherein the user will call forth through in corporeal form a clone of themselves, crafted from flame. At this level, the clone is quite weak and can only really serve as a distraction more so than a viable combat replacement. However, it does have its uses, which alongside detonating upon destruction or on command, are numerous. Note: The clone only has 1/10 the stats of the original user including taijutsu bonuses. The clone can use 1 jutsu that the user knows once a thread. The clone must have the required stats to use the jutsu, as well as be the same element of the jutsu. For every 5 Reserves, 1 clone may be created.														
958	2	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 7, Tactics 7, Control 6																
958	3	1	Fire Element: Three	Katon: San	Type: Ninjutsu At this stage of learning, users of this technique are expected to be quite adept at controlling the flow of chakra in their body. It is by this that they are now able to both create ample amounts of chakra and distribute to both hands (still only two fingers per hand). The actual heat effect of this technique, though, still hasn't changed much from Katon: Ni. Also, awkwardly enough, the user is still unable to have the technique travel throughout one whole hand.														
958	3	2	Fire Element: Dragon Fire Technique	Katon Ryuuka no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A jutsu that sends a stream of fire towards the opponent, originating from the users mouth. In some cases it has been seen to take on the form of a dragon. Capable of being used like a flamethrower, prolonged exposure has been known to transform boulders and cliffsides into molten piles of magma. Base Effect: The flame can be held for two posts. Stage Four Effect: The flame can be held for three posts. Stage Five Effect: The flame can be held for five posts.														
958	3	3	Fire Element: Flame Sphere Technique	Katon: Kyuuka no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Quite different from the other various other Katons in Leaf's arsenal, this one instead is a defensive jutsu. Quite easy to learn, it is also performed much differently from other jutsus. Using the body as a heat source, the user molds chakra to amplify it and make it entirely visible. Then the user expands it, using more chakra, and takes on a red, spherical shape. This shield is used as a defense against both ninjutsus and taijutsus. It isn't very powerful, though, and can only parry at most one technique before deactivating. A drawback to this jutsu, though, is based on the body's temperature. If the user performs this technique late in a fight they risk fainting due to both a drastic change in body temperature and already stressed circumstances. Note: The user must remain still while using this technique and my choose to include nearby teammates in it as well. Base Effect: May block techniques up to Stage 2, and users who possess Stage 2 in any Taijutsu. Stage Four Effect: May block techniques up to Stage 3, and users who possess Stage 3 in any Taijutsu. Stage Five Effect: May block techniques up to Stage 4, and users who possess Stage 4 in any Taijutsu.														
958	3	4	Fire Element: Incendiary Technique	Katon: Shouidan no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Recently developed, this technique is much akin to the Katon Ryuuka no Jutsu in a few ways. Using almost the identical set of seals, the user instead coughs out globs of what looks to be silver-tinged mucous. These flammable, gelatinous balls can be scattered along any area and even on other people and are highly combustible. Anything from the slightest spark can ignite them and set off variable explosions based on the level of the shinobi as well as leave a lasting flame going. Note: Areas affected by this technique remain kindled for the remainder of the thread unless otherwise doused. Base Effect: Explosions created from this gel with active radiuses of 1-2m. Five globs may be created. Stage Four Effect: Explosions created from this gel create explosions with active radiuses of 4-5m. Seven globs may be created. Stage Five Effect: Explosions created from this gel bear the intensity of 5-10m. Ten globes may be created.														
958	3	5	Fire Element: Bed of Fire Technique	Katon: Hidoko no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Defensive or offensive, this just is simple enough to have many uses. Heaving a mighty breath, a shinobi will spew an oily substance in front or even around them. It will rush forth like liquid and ignite as soon as the user wills it. The effect is obvious enough, resulting in a carpet of flame in whatever manner the user provided. It could be in a cone laid out in front of them as an opponent is rushing forth, or it could be scattered across a weapon.

958	4	1	Katon: Four	Katon: Shi	Type: Ninjutsu Much unchanged from Katon: San, the most noticeable change here is the strength of the heat effect set off by the user's fingers. Now able to melt through various objects of higher density than glass (not including metals), the only drawback is that this intensity is only attainable through one hand at the moment. One could compare the effect of this technique to being stabbed with a searing hot kunai. Essentially, this is just a much more combat effective version of Katon: Ni. Note: This technique cannot be stacked with Katon: San wherein both hands can be used at the same time with one hand stronger than the other.														
958	4	2	Fire Element: Powerful Fireball Technique	Katon Goukakyuu no Jutsu	Requirement: Katon Ryuuka Type: Ninjutsu Uses a high amount of chakra which allows the user to breath out a large portion of flame. Extremely powerful, this Katon seems to possess a denser mass than most Katons. This would explain its intense potency and explosive nature.														
958	4	3	Fire Element: Burning Rush	Katon: Nenshou Tosshin	Type: Ninjutsu A two-part technique that acts much like the Katon: Kyuuka no Jutsu. With the same seal sequence as the aforementioned jutsu, the dragon, ox and hare are added at the end and the technique changes from defensive to offensive. As the customary sphere surrounding the user appears to fade out, it instead sweeps back and wraps itself around the user in the elemental shape of flames at the arms and shoulders. At this, the user finds themselves temporarily invigorated. Note: This jutsu is both defensive and offensive, both blocking attacks and acting as one itself. The invigorating effect (increase in speed level) lasts for two posts. Afterwards the effect passes and the user is left strained (speed decreases by one level) for one post. Base Effect: May block techniques up to Stage 3, and users who possess Stage 3 in any Taijutsu. Speed is increased by one level. Stage Five Effect: May block techniques up to Stage 4, and users who possess Stage 4 in any Taijutsu. Speed is increased by one level. Stage Six Effect: May block techniques up to Stage 5, and users who possess Stage 5 in any Taijutsu. Speed is increased by one level.														
958	4	4	Fire Element: Fireproof Technique	Katon: Taika no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu At this point in time, the user has developed a natural resilience to flame and has come to know the pros and cons of their own techniques. With this knowledge in hand, they are able to not only guard themselves against fire and high temperatures but also anything around them. Expelling chakra at a constant rate, it acts a shield or buffer against all forms of heat, completely preventing them from harm. But by freely imparting this chakra onto a person or thing, they are able to pass on that very same shield. There are, however, limitations. Note: Only up to two things may be protected in this way, there are no limitations on what can be protected. This technique can only be used once per thread and the sharing effect must be used within the first three posts of activation. Base Effect: Objects are protected against three Katons from Stage 4 or below. Stage Five Effect: Objects are protected against three Katons from Stage 5 or below. Stage Six Effect: Objects are protected against four Katons from Stage 6 or below.														
958	4	5	Pulse Blast Technique	Katon: Myaku Hitofuki no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu An extremely useful jutsu, this one has the effect of flushing out or separating multiple opponents. Hurling a fireball about the size of a basketball, it is meant to be dodged in order to be effective. For at center of this fireball is a gaseous core which, when the spherical attack finally makes contact with something, will explode and this gas will expand rapidly in a loud bang. The bang is simply a precursor though, as instantly afterwards a sharp concussive force will issue out all around the center of the blast. Though the explosion of the attack itself is not very strong, the force it sends out is enough to knock anyone who is within a certain radius of it flying. Base Effect: The radius of this invisible force is 6m. The force of the blow will knock opponents away 5ft. Stage Five Effect: The radius of this invisible force is 9m. The force of the blow will knock opponents away 10ft. Stage Six Effect: The radius of this invisible force is 12m. The force of the blow will knock opponents away 15ft.														
958	4	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 15, Tactics 15, Willpower 13, Power 14																
958	5	1	Fire Element: Five	Katon: Go	Type: Ninjutsu This is where the technique evolves into one of the most deadly techniques within the Leaf. This is the stage before Kaseiken, the only move of comparable strength to the Chidori within the Leaf's arsenal. In this building block, however, the user mimics the hand movement and effect of Chidori, replacing lightning with flame. Here, unlike the techniques leading up to this, flames now spring forth from the user's entire hand. If the user balls their hand into a fist, however, the flames immediately disperse and the jutsu is cancelled. In this way, only spear-handed attacks can be made and their potency is increased so that most defenses can now be pierced. Note: This jutsu can pierce through any non-liquid-based defense Stage 4 or lower.														
958	5	2	Fire Element: Hydra Technique	Katon Hidora no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A variant of the Katon Ryuuka no jutsu, this one has the same function, only tripled. Instead of one stream of fire that advances towards the opponent, the user is capable of exhaling three at the same time, although all still vary from each other at only a slight degree (meaning that they can only be used against enemies that stand close to each other and not at different directions). The 3 streams look like 3 snakes, and that's where the jutsu got its name.														
958	5	3	Fire Element: Longsword Technique	Katon: Daitou no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Similarly performed as compared to the Katon Kyuuka, the user instead focuses all heat around them onto their skin. Then, by molding chakra in the most precise manner they are able to turn their entire arm, the most dominant usually, into a long, flaming sword. It shoots out from the arm and remains there for a few moments, incinerating anything it touches. Comprised of the same sort of heat given off by the Kyuuka, it is basically amplified to the point where it can be used offensively. If it used longer than a minute (one post) the user's arm will be singed and will be unavailable for the rest of the fight. Note: Range of this technique varies from 3-5 feet depending on the user's preference. Also, it cannot pierce or destroy defensive jutsus in higher stages than its own.														
958	5	4	Fire Element: Blazing Column Technique	Katon: Hibashira no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A Katon with a power exceeding that of Katon Goukakyu, but not nearly as powerful as the Karyuu Endan, this technique can clear entire forests when used correctly. Creating a circular, burning tower by breathing out a large fireball at first (much like Katon Goukakyu) the person who uses this technique is able to guide it with their chakra. The tower, or column, itself ranges from 4-5m in height and possesses a radius of at most 2m. The user guides its path with chakra, but it is very limited. If at all, the user is only capable of leading the flaming tower in a general direction. This tower can last up to 3 minutes (2 posts) before its roaring destruction lets up.														
958	5	5	Burning Clone	Katon: Neshou Bunshin	Type: Welling chakra up, the user releases it into the air around them after a series of hand-seals. This creates clones of fire, disguised to look exactly like the user. The clones have the user's stats, including 1/3 of taijutsu bonuses. Each clone may use a single jutsu (stage three and below) that the owner knows and the clone has the stats for (the jutsu must be from the Katon list and cannot be another clone-forming technique). One clone may be made per every 10 Reserves. When destroyed, the clones burst into flame, capable of creating first degree burns and lighting clothing/leaves/paper/etc on fire.														
958	5	6	Fire Element: Shatterforce Technique	Katon: Kudakasei no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Descriptions: Built upon the principles of Katon: Myaku Hitofuki no Jutsu, this technique instead acts as a much more powerful, centralized version. Gathering heat in between both hands the user focuses it until it cannot be condensed further. Manifested as a sphere of raw, glowing energy it is at first held at bay as if only for show. Then, given any cue, the user slams the sphere into the ground, causing it to explode with the power of pure heat behind it. The user is unaffected by this burst of power, but anyone within the radius of the blast suffers some unsettling consequences alongside the devastating concussive force it sends forth. This technique, by sheer strength alone, has even been known to crack boulders. Note:Separate effects of the jutsu are that the intense heat dehydrates any opponents caught within the radius of the blast, drawing them closer to fatigue, blurring their vision and causing mild headaches all the while. Minor, first-degree burns may also result from this technique. 16 Power: The radius of the attack is 5m. - 23 Power: The radius of the attack is 7m. -- 30 Power: The radius of the attack is 10m.														
958	6	1	Flame Fist	Kaseiken	Type: Ninjutsu Kaiseken, essentially, is an attack that causes an intense explosion by transferring all heat from the user's hand into the object it makes contact with. From the outside, it looks like the flame enveloping the user's hand is also enveloping the object in question and it is the force of the punch that causes the explosion. If this were the case, this technique would clearly be much more taijutsu-oriented than ninjutsu. But it's not so simple, really. There are obvious drawbacks to this transfer of chakra-gone-flame, such as being so close to explosion itself. Although the technique is easily able to destroy massive boulders and cliff sides upon contact, the danger presents itself in the rubble and shock to the arm from such devastation. Because of this, the technique can only be used twice a day for even the most gifted jounin. If used any more, the bones of the user's arm will shatter from internal pressures caused by the technique. 26 Power: Can completely destroy Stage 5 defensive techniques (taijutsu or ninjutsu). - 33 Power: Can completely destroy Stage 6 defensive techniques (taijutsu or ninjutsu). 24 Reserves: Can be used once a thread. - 32 Reserves: Can be used twice a thread. 25 Control: Using this technique will cause the user's Speed and Stamina to fall by one level. - 34 Control: Using this technique has no effect on the user's Speed and Stamina.														
958	6	2	Fire Element: Fire Dragon Blast	Katon Karyuu Endan	Type: Ninjutsu A jutsu that sends a stream of fire towards the opponent in the shape of a large dragon from the users mouth. The intensity of the flame is enough to completely melt stone and the end result of this techniques rampage is an explosion enough to send an entire mountain aquiver.														
958	6	3	Fire Element: Fire Lily Technique	Katon Yurika no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Comparable to the Katon Housenka no Jutsu but different still, this technique is obviously kept within only the most seasoned shinobi of the Leaf. Breathing in and expanding their lungs to an almost impossible size, the user breaths out gigantic fireballs (of comparable make and strength of the Katon Goukakyu). A highly draining technique, it more than makes up for the chakra consumption in potency. Entire engagements have both started and ended with this one technique, easily felling multiple enemies in one ferocious attack. 21 Power: Can create five separate fireballs. - 28 Power: Can create six separate fireballs. -- 35 Power: Can create seven separate fireballs. 19 Reserves: Can be used twice a thread. - 27 Reserves: Can be used three times a thread.														
958	6	4	Fire Sealing	Fuuinka	Type: Ninjutsu Yet another form of fire mastery, this particular technique was originally developed and mastered by the Sannin Jiraiya. Sometimes seen as the jutsu within a jutsu, this one has properties that only the most talented of shinobi will ever master. Unleashing a scroll usually readied in advance, the user tosses it in front of them and then performs the necessary seals. At once the scroll absorbs almost any incoming Katon and stores it within the scroll for later use or even study. However, much unlike Jiraiya, no other ninja within the Leaf or anywhere else was ever able to bring this technique to his level. Because of that, it has particular limitations that the Sannin himself was not obliged to adhere to. Note: Only one technique can be sealed at a time, and only two per thread. Using a technique that has been sealed is limited in that that specific technique must be used within the next two posts after it has been absorbed into the scroll. Seals labeled for 'study' (not copying) cannot be used in combat whatsoever. Summoned creatures are exempt from this rule, but not their techniques. Also, only techniques Stage Six and below are capable of being absorbed.														
958	6	5	Fire Element: Hellfire Clap	Katon: Gouka Hataka no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu A jutsu of catastrophic might, it draws upon the unwieldiness that is flame. Calling forth chakra from their deepest reserves, the user will perform the trademark techniques that signal the beginning of a Katon. Yet rather than ending in the Tora seal, as most would, it instead ends in the Ram seal as the user's hands clap together loudly. At that moment a wave of destructive fire flies forth around the user, engulfing all around them. Spread about in a circle, this technique also has the nasty side-effect of searing through anything it comes into contact with. If in its path lay a boulder it would be hewn in two, for example. Defensive jutsu are defeated by this technique as well, for its intensity is beyond measure. 15 Reserves: The diameter of this technique is 16m. - 22 Reserves: The diameter of this technique is 18m. -- 29 Reserves: The diameter of this technique is 20m. 16 Control: Bypasses Stage 4 defensive techniques (taijutsu and ninjutsu). - 24 Control: Bypasses Stage 5 defensive techniques (taijutsu and ninjutsu). -- 32 Control: Bypasses Stage 6 defensive techniques (taijutsu and ninjutsu).

958	7	1	Fierce Flame Fist	Moushou Kaseiken	Type: Ninjutsu A fabled level of mastery, this version of the Kaseiken almost completely revolutionizes the previous. Rather than flames wrapping around a users fist, the fire instead engulfs the user completely and generally makes the user look imposing, even demonic. But these flames are much more than show. Now that the flame that was previously surrounding only the fist is available in such large amounts through the entire body, the destruction of the attack is also multiplied five-fold. However, this is a make or break technique. At this stage of mastery, the explosion itself can be controlled enough so that the user is not harmed, but the amount of chakra it takes to both control and create such force immediately user to fight at his limits. Note: Can only be used once a thread and to strike an opponent with this technique requires admin/player approval. Afterwards, the user's Speed and Stamina decrease by one for three posts. It also retains the effect of Kaseiken, but now it may decimate any defensive jutsu Stage 7 or below.														
958	7	2	Fire Element: True Hydra Technique	Katon: Shinhidora no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu An extremely powerful technique, used only by the most powerful of Leaf-nins, it has been known to destroy entire landscapes in one fell swoop. By somewhat summoning a large, fiery monstrosity in front of them: a Fire Dragon with three heads, the user is able to fire three Katons equal in strength to the Karyuu Endan at three different targets, or all at one.														
958	7	3	Fire Element: Blazing Clone Technique	Katon: Homura Bunshin no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu Fashioned from flame, this clone is much different than its other elemental counterparts. A base and rather expected property of this bunshin is that it's extremely warm to the touch. Each blow dealt by it could be compared to being hit with a newly fashioned sledgehammer straight from the forge. Second to that would be its innate tendency to explode in a burst of flame when dealt a killing blow, comparable to that of a few exploding notes. However, it's more unique abilities are thus: Creating a Katon Bunshin is not as simple a matter as it may seem. Unlike most others, this one is crafted straight from a user's mouth, quite literally breathing life into it. So, in effect, this can be used both as a tool and a form of attack all in one. And still, even, each bunshin is easily equipped with a majority of the user's own techniques. Note: Obviously quite an elaborate and powerful bunshin, there are some key restrictions here as well. Only one bunshin may be created in any given post, and at maximum three bunshins in one thread (past or present). Its stats are that of the users, though limited to Ã‚Â½ their taijutsu bonuses. The limit is based on reserves, and a user must possess 15 points per bunshin (45 in reserves would meet the maximum amount of bunshins in a single thread). Also, the amount of techniques each bunshin knows is dependent on the user. All Katons Stage 6 and below at the user's disposal are taken as the bunshin's as well, though taijutsu specials are dependent on its stats. They can use one technique at most and afterwards disperse naturally as a wisp of smoke.														
958	7	4	Fire Transport Technique	Katon Shunshin no Jutsu	Type: Ninjutsu In a haze of flame the user travels from place to place, quite literally leaving disaster in their wake. Much unlike the varying techniques that most other villages boast, this one not only carries the user from one area to another in an elemental, almost ethereal form, but causes a great deal of devastation as well. Performing the necessary seals, the user suddenly becomes the literal form of fire and moves in that form. Also unlike it's other counterparts, this technique is very much offensive in that the entire area around an opponent can be set ablaze as well and keep them from escaping. Note: Once used, the person who performed this technique must exit the thread no matter the outcome of the attack. It is quite literally an escape technique.														
958	7	5	Fire Element: Raging Storm of the Dragon	Katon: Oorashi no Ryu	Type: Ninjutsu An extremely powerful technique that tests the physical limits of the user, it is the mark of a true Katon Master. Using all methods of heat creation and transferal, the user channels chakra all over their body and dramatically bends forward, their back hunched and aimed upward. Then, slamming their crossed arms onto the ground in from of them, firmly planting both palms on the ground, the user erupts in a blazing column of impenetrable flame. What the result is what can only be described as a funnel of pure fire. Designed to be used defensively over all else, the fire as well takes different form as floods of chakra meant to reinforce the technique discolor it. Purple, blue and red all at once, this funnel surrounds the user completely and has obvious effects: anything that makes contact with the user during this technique becomes instantly enflamed, and such force by the chakra launches it back. Note: This attack only lasts one post and no more. It can only be used twice per thread because of its obvious strengths. It has a 4-post cooldown, within which only techniques from Stage 4 and below may be used.

958	8	1	Highest Ranking Fire Sealing	Fuuinka Koui	Type: Ninjutsu A technique which was once known to be unique solely to Jiraiya, it has been passed down to only the most celebrated of shinobi in Konoha. A marker of their might and cunning, this seal retains almost all the effects of the lesser Fuuinka, but with all limitations removed. It is the strongest form of Fire Sealing, and no technique yet has been able to overcome it. Note: Almost all limitations from the previous techniques (minus the detail about copying) are removed. That is to say, all fire-based techniques fall prey to this one. The only things exempt are Summons (as mentioned in the Fuuinka). The scroll usage is carried between threads and the amount that can be stowed away is nearly unlimited. These details will be added to character sheets and removed when appropriate.														
958	8	2	Fire Element: Pandemonium	Katon: Daikonran	Type: Ninjutsu Very few people have seen this technique in action and even less have ever spoken of it. And yet as cliche as that sounds, it is most definitely a truth that cannot be denied. During the course of a battle, the user carefully sets different parts of the battlefield on fire and then sets this very special technique to use. Drawing upon the heat energy from all the surrounding flames, the user transforms them into spheres of purely charged heat through the use of very particular seals. Then, as the seals are completed, the balls begin to surround the opponent. Finally, they close in on the enemy at incredible speeds and the heat is completely absorbed into their bodies causing them to explode from all the internal pressures and other biological processes which have failed due to the intense rise in temperature. The user can, also, delay this process by mentally dragging each sphere through the air and disabling an opponent's appendages one by one before finishing them off.														
958	8	3	Fire Element: Firefox	Katon: Kitsune-hi	Type: Ninjutsu  The most feared creature in the world provides the basis of this technique: the legendary Kyuubi. Known to be passed between Hokage's and their proteges through oral tradition, the technique is more a ritual akin to summoning than a normal ninjutsu. Biting their thumb, the user scribbles several runes of power onto the ground and then places both hands firmly on the ground in front of it. The ground cracks and spews forth liquid magma, which then takes the shape of the creature of yore. The size of a moderately-sized house, it's nine whipping tails spell death and destruction. The creature moves with a will of its own, incinerating all it touches and creating explosions with every step of its paws. At its climax the Kyuubi-shaped creation will explode, and it's nine tails will each become a separate attack amongst itself, each with the power of Katon Karyuu Endan. There has been no technique in Konoha's history to match the sheer devastating power of this.														
957	1	1	Shadow Glare	Nirami no Kage	Type: Genjutsu Manipulating what a shadow looks like is no large feat for the shinobi of Leaf. But at this level, the most basic, they are only able to increase the depth by which a person might perceive a shadow. For example, a shadow can either be lengthened or shortened, giving off the impression that a person is closer or father. When used in large expanses with abundant shade, this jutsu can prove quite worrisome. Illusion is triggered when looking at the shadow.														
957	1	2	Mark of the Unfamiliar	Etainoshirenai no Fugou	Type: Genjutsu Another fundamental jutsu, this one changes a person's writing, mark, or even an inscription to that of another. By doing this, simple directions can be misread or pathways can be changed. It is all up to the discretion of the person reading the sign, though, since merely touching the word or mark in question can easily break the spell. Illusion is triggered when looking at the modified object.														
957	1	3	Through the Unfamiliar	Etainoshirenai no Tsuujite	Type: Genjutsu Strange in its uses, this genjutsu is fairly harmless. What it does is makes any opponent who falls into its area of effect imagine that they have just undergone a certain sense of dÃƒÂ©jÃƒ* vu. That is to say, they begin to question whether they are following the right path or direction since the one in front of them seems too familiar to be the right way.														
957	1	4	Sounding the Unfamiliar	Etainoshirenai no Oto	Type: Genjutsu Another harmless genjutsu, this one simply makes an opponent imagine that, in dark places, different animals begin to call out from all around them. This can range from a cat's meow just behind them to an owl's hoot above. The user's own voice is what makes these sounds and then he/she manipulates them with chakra. Therefore, it goes without saying that this genjutsu affects ones sense of sound.														
957	1	5	Touch of the Unfamiliar	Etainoshirenai no Tacchi	Type: Genjutsu This jutsu, by its name alone, obviously takes into account a person's sense of touch. Much unlike the rest of these jutsu, this one is activated once a person touches a particular object that the user has charmed'. It can be as obvious as a kunai being sent at an opponent from any distance, or even the leaves of a tree. In short, what it does is it makes the user question whether or not the particular item existed or not. So if a person were to be stabbed with a kunai, they would seem to not feel the pain of the kunai, but would realize it much later since the effect of the jutsu is quite short. In the example of leaves, a person could pass through a veil of leaves and only have their other four senses to rely on as to whether or not those leaves even truly existed, causing a very distinct sense of confusion. Minimum duration: 1, Maximum duration: 4, Base duration: 2														
957	1	6	Open Slot																
957	2	1	Shadow Taunt	Chouba no Kage	Type: Genjutsu In this jutsu, the user visually manipulates a shadow into taking another form aside from the one it actually is. For example, what was once the shadow of a short male can be shaped into that of a voluptuous woman. This technique, however, is fairly easy to see through since it cannot really be used on a shadow that a person is currently looking at. Whatever the case, though, it does tend to cause some confusion within those who are weak in perception.														
957	2	2	Scent of Peculiar	Dokuji no Kaori	Type: Genjutsu This jutsu makes use of the as-of-yet popular sense of smell. It has been known for ages past that there are certain scents that excite different emotions. Scents in this area can make something as simple as dust smell endearing, or make crushed leaves give off a 'toxic' (more like pungent) aroma from simply inhaling. By this, both traps and warnings can be made of simple objects, not to mention the handy note of covering up ones tracks.														
957	2	3	Leer of the Peculiar	Dokuji no Gyoushi	Type: Genjutsu A somewhat harmless jutsu, this one is made through eye contact. A form of intimidation, this one seemingly communicates malicious intent upon a victim and is often used to open up attacks from teammates. Not necessarily stunning, it does provoke an opponent into thinking twice before engaging in battle. Note: The effect of this jutsu is somewhat questionable, but the gist of it is that it makes an opponent seem unsure of him or herself for a moment if it is successful. This may or may not include missed punches, late dodging, etc. Kai will cancel the feeling of uncertainty immediately. Base duration of 0, Minimum of 0, Maximum of 3.														
957	2	4	Camouflage of the Peculiar	Dokuji no Gisou	Type: Genjutsu Here is one of the many techniques used to hide shinobi from their pursuers if even but for a short while. Taking in natural components to their attire (leaves, twigs, dirt, mud, etc.) a person is able to lie still in an area of similar settings and remain completely impervious to detection. By strewing together chakra and a visual illusion, whatever the user takes onto their clothes bind to them and become a literal part of their appearance, changing it to suit the environment. Simply touching the user will cancel this jutsu, though. Note: Just as mentioned in the sentence above, this technique is only dispatched through touch and can last as long as the user needs. Kai, obviously, works against it as well.														
957	2	5	Voice of the Peculiar	Dokuji no Onsei	Type: Genjutsu This is a complimentary technique to the Chouba no Kage, though can stand alone as well. A verbal aid, it manipulates a person's voice and makes them seem either more or less imposing. When coupled with the Chouba no Kage, it can make the user seem possessed: changing both their voice and their shadow to those more intimidating. By itself, it can used as a very noteworthy distraction and can also deter opponents from engaging the user right away. Skilled shinobi can make their voice sound like that of other people they have encountered rather than just changing pitch and tone. Note: 'Skilled', in this context, means having at least two jutsus in Stage Three in any other list (including this one).														
957	2	6	Open Slot																
957	3	1	Shadow Swell	Minagiru no Kage	Type: Genjutsu This is a rather useful technique despite its simplicity. Visually expanding a shadow, the user is able to cover a large area in pseudo-darkness and thus forces an opponent to rely on their senses aside from sight. Not to say that this completely blinds a person, but it can easily make day seem like night in certain settings, thus causing both great confusion and making direct combat difficult to an extent. Note: This only visually manipulates shadows. Jutsus that rely on shadow as a form of attack (like Nara jutsu) cannot exploit this technique. The illusion kicks off the moment the initial shadow is seen by the target.														
957	3	2	Spell of the Gale	Boufuu no Jumon	Type: Genjutsu A single sharp whistle within of the wind is nothing of particular concern to shinobi, and thus targets of the genjutsu. Natural settings like these are, in fact, what tend to mask a shinobi from harm. However, this genjutsu acts in a very different way than 'natural' wind would. Here the jutsu makes an opponent or group both feel and hear the wind coming from every direction. It causes a very definite effect and tends to put people on alert. Prolonged exposure to this jutsu interferes a person's ability to hear around them properly.														
957	3	3	Spell of the Leaves	Konoha no Jumon	Type: Genjutsu This is a visual jutsu that takes advantage of nearby foliage. Without moving, a user is able to make themselves appear within the blink of an eye behind a veil of leaves. That is to say, they can make a bunshin-like apparition that has their form but also manipulates the greenery around them. When they are destroyed, they pop in and expose a flurry of leaves. This technique can be compared to Oboro Bunshin no Jutsu, except that its effect is dependent on plants. Note: Can be used continuously so long as the user remains motionless.														
957	3	4	Spell of the Trees	Kyouboku no Jumon	Type: Genjutsu This jutsu, clearly, requires the presence of trees to work. Its effect is simple enough but valuable when trying to escape an opponent. By altering the surrounding trees in an area, the user is able to create a path by which an opponent - on seeing the altered terrain - is 'forced' to take. So, rather than being followed into one area, the user can force their opponent to follow another, possibly into a trap. This jutsu is hard to detect because there is very little difference between these imaginary trees and the real thing. Except, of course, if the pursuer is clumsy enough to run or leap into the illusion. That or, of course, they are following the user by any other means besides sight and sound.														
957	3	5	Spell of the Oleander	Kyouchikutou no Jumon	Type: Genjutsu The first truly offensive jutsu, this technique makes use of imagery to cast both fear and doubt in an opponent. With a pile of leaves or even shred paper, the user blows them into an opponents face and thus activates the genjutsu. The leaves or paper are 'charmed' and release the effect upon making contact with the opponent. At first the opponent is merely annoyed by these fragrance-filled, white petals being blown in their face. But then, after a few seconds, the techniques effect kicks in and makes the opponent think and feel that they've been poisoned. Nothing serious, of course, but just the thought of being poisoned and having only a few minutes to live can cause so much stress on a person that it may cause them to faint. This causes obvious hindrances to combat. Base duration: 2 posts ; Minimum duration: 1 post ; Maximum duration: 3 posts

957	4	1	Shadowmeld	Kagemazeru	Type: Genjutsu This jutsu allows a person to visually manipulate shadows in a manner that essentially combines all the previous ones like it. The user is able to create shadows of any proportion out of thin air and even, in good conditions, become near-invisible within them. They do this by making eye contact with an opponent and locking them in this very subtle genjutsu. Other senses, most especially touch, override this technique though.														
957	4	2	Echo of Clarity	Meiryou no Hibiki	Type: Genjutsu A defensive technique at the core, Echo of Clarity, like all other illusions aims at creating confusion in the target's mind. However, it differs in that while it is in effect, it sows doubt in the mind of the target every time the latter attempts to attack the user. Not exactly a mere deterrent, the illusion fools the target into believing that his attacks are almost guaranteed to miss or countered by the user. Indeed, Echo of Clarity gives the impression that the user has so high perception that there are almost no openings in his guard, giving pause to anyone trying to strike him. For instance, should the target simply think or plan on attacking the user with a certain technique, the illusion would cause him to see the user simultaneously, or rather pre-emptively, prepare a defensive jutsu. Likewise, if the target merely plans on attacking from a certain angle, the Genjutsu would lead him to picture the user defending that very angle. It usually leads the target to hesitate much more, making him more likely to leave openings of his own. Note: There is a single hand seal to activate this genjutsu; the opponent is affected by it the moment he looks at this seal.														
957	4	3	Echo of Autumn	Aki no Hibiki	Type: Genjutsu Yet another jutsu that makes use of imagery, this one takes into account both plants and wind. By making eye contact with the opponent, they are able to rearrange the scenery around them to their needs. They cannot create an entirely new environment; merely shape the existing one in any way they see fit. This allows for a multitude of options in tactics and serves to easily confuse even the most perceptive of opponents. The wind aspect here is secondary option for most user's since they can simulate the sensation of wind in an opponent's mind as well. The use of this ability can be very misleading.														
957	4	4	Echo of Lament	Aitou no Hibiki	Type: Genjutsu A technique fashioned for defense, this one takes a rather different approach. It is, in fact, fashioned for reversal and is quite dangerous in effect. Preparing the jutsu ahead of time, it is passive until activated with precise chakra control. Through any of the senses, the genjutsu is passed on and it quickly alters the image an opponent sees. What appears to the opponent as a direct hit on their target, whether it is as simple as a kunai plunging into their thigh or a genjutsu immobilizing them with fear, an opponent will see this outcome played out as exactly as if it would have really happened. Yet it is the ability of this technique to make one think that and thus leave a very critical opening in any person's defense. Note: Despite all factors which affect the duration of genjutsus, this technique lasts for only two posts.														
957	4	5	Echo of Defiance	Chousen no Hibiki	Type: Genjutsu With this technique, the user basically wears down an opponent's resistance to genjutsu by attacking one of the five senses. Triggered when the user makes eye contact with his target, this technique causes certain reactions in the opponent. The latter merely imagine themselves going through either of these reactions: blurred vision, delayed motor reaction, dulled sense of hearing, and trouble breathing (at the user's discretion). While Echo of Defiance is in use, should a target be afflicted by another Genjutsu on top of it, the duration of the new illusion is increased by one post (Although the duration cannot go beyond the maximum duration). Note: Echo of Defiance counts towards the maximum number of allowed 'stacked' Genjutsu.														
957	4	6	Open Slot																
957	5	1	Nightmare Shadow	Akumu Kage	Type: Genjutsu This technique forces an opponent to believe the shadows around them act independent of the light cast in the particular setting. They shape and form various objects of likewise varying proportions. What is actually happening here is that the user is recreating scenes or things from their past which have caused them harm to some extent. It can range as being as complex and morbid was witnessing the birth and slaughter of a newborn, or even to something as trivial as clown-shaped figures surrounding the opponent from all sides. The shadows, of course, have no face or actual presence. They are merely shapes which hint at the aforementioned events. The user must remain unseen in this jutsu, however, since he or she would blur and disturb the images which the shadows are creating in the opponent's mind. Note: This technique can affect more than one person. Individual reactions to the technique may vary. Minimum duration: 1, Base duration: 2, Maximum duration: 3														
957	5	2	Sleep	Nemuri	Type: Genjutsu A simple jutsu in which the user first concentrates for a few moments on both the target and themselves, meditating before initiating the jutsu. To activate this jutsu, direct contact between the user and a victim must be made. An open-palmed wrap on the shoulder, back, or chest will almost instantly force the victim into a state of unconsciousness. The last thing the victim sees before falling asleep are white, ethereal bird feathers floating down in front of them. This technique, however, has literally no combat use since it takes an ample amount of time to prepare the necessary amount of chakra. Note: Cannot be used in combat, and must also have victim's consent before being used.														
957	5	3	Forgetfulness	Kenbou	Type: Genjutsu A somewhat whimsical and fanciful technique, this one is most often familiarized with mind control but is very much different. Using only a pre-designated seal as the focal point, the user is able to alter their chakra to affect memories to a very basic extent by creating new ones which replace or block out anything current. For example, an enemy might come up to the user and try to interrogate their purpose. With this technique, the user will 'suggest' that the victim has mistaken him as somebody else and should carry on with his duties. Most often, the user wins out in these cases but it will not work against all. Another way to use this technique is by making a victim suddenly remember that they have something to do. Another example would be like making a guard recall that they have to check the keys in at the barracks and must return to do so. The limits of this technique are obvious. Actual memories cannot be recreated, only suggestions which would allude to real memories. Also, these memories can be so false that a victim will realize immediately that there is something the matter and will see this as a sign of provocation. Note: If the sum of the user's primary attributes exceed the sum of the victim's primary attributes then this technique can be successful. This does not go to say, however, that this technique works every time. Judgment of whether or not this technique works on a victim will be done on a case by case basis.														
957	5	4	Recklessness	Chototsu	Type: Genjutsu This technique is quite powerful even for this stage of learning, but has certain drawbacks which help convey both its seriousness and fallouts. Using the necessary amount of the seals, the user begins to hum as if in meditation. This sound carries out across the field of a battle and affects everyone in its vicinity; including allies. Once activated the jutsus inhibits certain extents of rational thought by portraying the user as overly skilful. This, in turn, causes them to become overly brash and confident, thus more likely to have openings. And though this doesn't necessarily improve combat effectiveness, it does block out certain skills from a victims memory. In short, it makes them 'forget' to use certain techniques and only allows to them use more simple ones. In allies, this works exactly the same. However, in allies, if the latter have this technique at their disposal and will recognize it in time so as to mentally block it.														
957	5	5	Firefly Masquerade	Narisumashi no Hotaru	Type: Genjutsu Drawing upon the somewhat slender mysticism that surrounds the firefly, this technique pushes for emotional reactions to the extent in which almost any victim can be affected. Holding a seal in place and hopefully within sight of the opponent (note that this isn't eye contact), the opponent immediately begins to see one or two fireflies enter the field as the environment begins to suddenly darken. Next, the technique subtly reaches its crux by the addition of more fireflies entering the dimmed field. They begin to surround both user and victim and provide nothing more than a lightshow at this stage. The last act of the technique forces the opponent to realize hidden fears when the fireflies suddenly converge upon the user and takes the shape of whichever person or thing the opponent fears most. Swiftly, the scene around them becomes blurred as hundreds more fireflies spin around the two and seemingly lock them within a chamber of light. At this point the user can 'travel' between all the light around them and speaks instances which would provoke the user's mental stability. These illusions are most obviously self-induced, but the user simply manifests them through this technique.

957	6	1	Temple of Nirvana Technique	Nehan Shoja no Jutsu	Type: Genjutsu An offset of Nemuri, this technique is instead increased tenfold and can affect a large group of people. Once more ineffective in combat, this also does not require physical contact to be made between the user and a victim to be initiated. Instead, this one is more easily recognized because the victims imagine feathers to be dropping down out of thin air for a few seconds before the technique actually settles in, providing a few precious moments to counter it.														
957	6	2	Demonic Illusion: Decaying Earth Technique	Magen: Haitai Chihyou no Jutsu	Type: Genjutsu Triggered when the user claps his hands together (following a series of seals usually) loud enough for the opponent to hear, this jutsu makes the user seem as if they are like dust being blown away by the wind. A visual effect which only serves to hide them, the bulk of the genjutsu begins with the ground underneath the opponent collapsing and acting almost like quicksand. But much unlike quicksand, it is not the ground itself that is dragging the opponent down, but half-skeleton replicas of ghosts or victims from the opponents past. Mothers, fathers, sibling, and rivals; anyone of significance in the opponent's life hopes to drown them in the now stagnant-looking earth, a vision of their hellish demise just below them. Note: This technique can affect more than one person. Individual reactions to the technique may vary.														
957	6	3	Demonic Illusion: Tree Binding Technique	Magen: Kishibari no Jutsu	Type: Genjutsu A genjutsu wherein the user disappears from an opponent's eyesight after the latter has witnessed the user perform the necessary seals. Then, in the few moments of confusion that ensue, the opponent seems to be entangled within the confines of a tree. It's not as if the tree grew out of the ground and around the opponent, no. It's almost as if the target had just grown out of the tree itself. In this state, the target undergoes a slight version of the Kanashibari no Jutsu in that their body becomes momentarily paralyzed. This, however, is a misconception. In this instance, the user has instead numbed the opponent's sense of touch to the point where they only think they are paralyzed. Then, in an extra feat of illusionary skill, the user appears to materialize from within the tree as well and may do as they please to the opponent. Note: The duration of the illusion is determined by normal means (Base duration, min. duration, etc). The 'binding' aspect, or the point in which the opponent is completely paralyzed, however lasts only for the first post in which they are under the effect of this jutsu. In this way, it only allows an ally to take advantage of the opening, not the character that performed this jutsu.														
957	6	4	Demonic Illusion: Fear Through the Eyes of Madness	Magen: Kyouran no Me kara Kyoufu	Type: Genjutsu A rather harsh jutsu, this one forces an opponent to not only face their fears, but to succumb to them. Trapped within the technique, the user believes themselves confronted by whatever person or thing they fear most in life, ready to do battle and oppose it. But despite any efforts they make, their fear remains immune and imposing. And for every attempt to defeat this manifestation of fear, the user only fails and is instead paid back their efforts tenfold. Stabbing their illusionary opponent in the chest with a kunai would only result in the user being impaled, for example. Once the opponent realizes this give and take relationship they begin to slowly realize their weakness and fall prey to an extreme sense of paranoia and the terror begins to consume them. Note: The technique is triggered when the opponent hears the footsteps of the user. It is obviously even more effective if the user is out of sight / concealed when the technique is triggered.														
957	6	5	Harbinger of Silence	Buin no Senkusha	Type: Genjutsu This technique is another of three which completely disables one of the major senses. In this case, it's ones sense of sound. A lengthy row of handseals begins the process, followed closely by, strangely enough, eye contact. Upon this, a looming figure of a hooded villain rises up behind the user and unsheathes a dagger from the bowels of its robes. And although this doesn't bind an opponent in place like some of the more potent genjutsus, it is instead fast-acting. As soon as the apparition appears, it lunges forth at the opponent and screams maniacally. At this point, the opponent 'seems' to have lost their hearing and is disabled in this way till they realize that the mysterious figure was purely imaginary.

957	7	1	Demonic Illusion: Avatar of Thirst	Magen: Katsu no Gongen	Type: Genjutsu Usually most effective when used against opponents venturing into unknown territory (this technique is somewhat similar to the one which forces and opponent to walk in circles without knowing it), the illusion is triggered when the opponent hears the sound of a howling wind - which is in fact created by the user. An arid desert sets the scene for the beginnings of this technique, withered trees and dying patches of grass littering the area around the user. Meant to only somewhat mimic the area in which the opponent once stood, the scene is used only to represent what is about to occur within the user. From wherever the user was last seen, a man cloaked in rustic and dishevelled brown arises with staff in hand. Looking up slowly from sunken eyes and clearly diseased skin, he screams out with such force that it pushes against the user. At this the scene quickly swirls around the opponent and all their senses are drowned out by the howling wind and sand. When they come to, a severe sense of dryness erupts from their throat and mouth. They lose the ability to speak under such stress and every breath taken is sharp to the touch. Difficulty breathing follows this pain, and a lethal sense discomfort forces the user to break down.														
957	7	2	Demonic Illusion: Avatar of Apathy	Magen: Tentan no Gongen	Type: Genjutsu Laziness and idleness have also led many men to ruin during the course of history. But even more dangerous is not the inability to act, but the choice not to. Through this technique, triggered once more when the user is seen completing his hand seals, that point is proven to the utmost by using false images to create doubt and an even greater scope of sluggishness in a victim. The setting begins in a darkened forest littered with cobwebs and the general sense of dread hanging over everyone present. Then, a child is heard weeping in the background as it finally reveals itself from within the shadows. A boy barely over the age of 10; his clothes depict a struggled life and the bags under his eyes hint at depravity. But his most prominent feature is the word 'Choice' carved deeply into his forehead. After observing the boy for a few moments and drinking in the words he communicates by his very presence, he lets out a scream which plunges the victims back to reality. From here on out they are faced with hesitance in every action they take, their vision and reflexes dimmed considerably. The lesson they take from this experience is that their actions directly decide whether people live or die, that their actions carry so much weight as to decide to fate of an innocent child. This technique acts quite unlike every other genjutsu thus far in that it makes it so that the target is unable to use any lists (even taijutsu and unique ones) starting the 2nd post of the illusion's duration. This does not, however, deactivate bloodlines. Curses or any other sort of secondary stat modifier also shut down and the user returns to their normal state. Anything else that might affect a character's performance will be judged on a case by case basis. For clarification, the 'vision' occurs in the first post and the effect kicks in only in the 2nd post.														
957	7	3	Demonic Illusion: Avatar of Conceit	Magen: Jifu no Gongen	Type: Genjutsu Pride has always been the downfall of many great men. The inability to accept the truth because one's personal merit contradicts it can prove quite devastating when controlled properly. By this technique, triggered when the opponent sees the user finish his series of seals, distorts the scene at hand by reserving it to only black and white. Then, a man garbed in elegant cloths and sallow skin arises from just in front of the victim. From within his robes he takes a brilliant ruby and literally embeds it within the victim's head. From that point forward, the illusions desist and the victim suddenly feels elated and able to do even the most impossible of feats. This sense of pride, however, blinds them from the fact that their movements are now clumsy and their senses dulled due to the mind-numbing focal point in their head. In effect, their battle effectiveness drops considerably.														
957	7	4	Demonic Illusion: Avatar of Fury	Magen: Gekijou no Gongen	Type: Genjutsu A prime human emotion which is both quite powerful and also a great weakness is one's own temper. Anger can be as liberating as it is blinding, and in a battle of cunning can bring about swift defeat. This technique, triggered once more when the user is seen completing his hand seals, embodies the mental state of fury and puts the opponent into a frenzy showing them various self-images and experiences. A spirit racked in archaic armor befriends the user as the technique begins. Then, after a few moments, the image seemingly breaks into the users mind with its own icy hands and brings about the jutsus effects. Bitter defeats, times of struggle, loss of loved ones, anything that is already present in the opponent's mind are distorted and amplified to shroud the user's thoughts in utter rage. They become self-absorbed and can think of nothing but that solitary moment that replays over and over in their head. It is so engaging that they lose all sense of self and slip into mindless fury. Eventually, however, this technique wears off and the user is left only with a lapse in memory (which can prove dangerous on its own). Note: During this time, the character quite literally falls into a trance-like state which cannot be broken unless they have Kai. There is no other alternative. The character, when under the effect of this genjutsu, may only use physical attacks.														
957	7	5	Mask of Cruelty	Reikoku no Fukumen	Type: Genjutsu This is a unique and powerful jutsu, triggered when the opponent comes into contact with the user's blood, which is supremely hard to master. Much unlike other genjutsus, this one affects an opponents mind very differently in that it causes hallucinations based on situation. Quite unique in this respect, it makes it so that every time the afflicted were to cause harm to another person, they would envision themselves being harmed instead. For example, an opponent making a lunge at the user would cause the afflicted to envision themselves in their place; visions of masochism, as it were. There have been stories of people too afraid to make any offensive attempts after being placed under this genjtusu, unable to either defend or attack their opponents out of utter fear. Note: As far as explaining the actual genjutsu, it's quite simple. In the above example, the person under the effect of this genjutsu will always picture and 'feel' that they are dealing themselves some sort of pain. So when they try to stab an opponent with a kunai, they will instead feel as if they are being stabbed with a kunai, regardless of the outcome of their attack. The same goes for ninjutsu: they are simply reflected back on the user. Confusing? Contact a mod to evaluate the usage of this jutsu if you have any questions.

957	8	1	Bringer of Darkness Technique	Kokuangyo no Jutsu	Type: Genjutsu An ancient technique created and mastered by the late Nidaime Hokage, it utilizes the foremost creator of fear: darkness. By creating a complete and impenetrable darkness around the user, the actual affect is not to scare them, but to disable them. Doujutsus are especially hindered by this technique because it affects the nervous system in such a way that it deactivates them. Indeed, there is very little that can pierce that jutsu, not even interference from allies. The only way to break this jutsu is by throwing the user off guard or if the user wills it.														
956	1	1	Wood Element: A Preface	Mokuton: Zenchi	To the shinobi of Konoha, Mokuton is much less an art than it is a tradition. A distinction between this style and that of the one implemented in Kusa is one of heritage. Passed on from Shodai Hokage, Mokuton was believed at first to be a kekkei genkai, and thus the secret was thought to have died with him. Yet somehow the villagers were able to harness this otherwise unnatural phenomenon. At this level, the user is simply able to mold their chakra to manifest in the form of wood all across their body. Projecting their chakra over long distances is, at this level, especially difficult and should not be attempted without further induction into the style. Notes: This technique gives access to further Mokuton and to swaps (Stages 1 and 2). It is not a jutsu in and of itself, but is required if one seeks to take any Mokuton in these stages. Examples of what can and can't be done at this level are taken from the jutsu that follow														
956	1	2	Mischievous Leaf Children Technique	Itazurakko no Konoha no Jutsu	This can technique can only be used on leaves already covering the ground. The user surgers chakra into the leaves on the ground, fully flattening them. Then, the user causes the leaves to become extremely slippery with chakra (like oil slick), which can cause opponents to slip and fall. Base Effect: The radius of the technique extends to about four meters. Stage Two Effect: The radius of the technique extends to about eight meters. Stage Three Effect: The radius of the technique extends to about sixteen meters.														
956	1	3	Wood Element: Sawdust	Mokuton: Ogakuzu	Used as a defensive technique, the user forms a thin layer of wood on their hands, then claps them together and grinds it into a fine dust. Clapping their hands together a second time produces a cloud of sawdust that can obscure vision, be inhaled, or blow directly into someone's eye. It is a very basic Mokuton that requires little or no guidance to perform.														
956	1	4	Rustling Leaves Technique	Gasagasa Konoha no Jutsu	The user can cause leaves within a forest to rustle loudly, which can be used to distract opponents, as well as bring about attention to the wrong direction.														
956	1	5	Leaf Cyclone Technique	Konoha Tsujikaze no Jutsu	Somewhat of a cross between Henge and Kawarimi, this technique is used to distract an opponent. By gathering chakra as when preparing to Kawarimi, they instead draw leaves or other such foliage to them, wrapping themselves in what looks to be a cyclone. Then, using a slight form of Henge, they can either slip out of this technique unhindered, or make it seem that way. Through this, they are able to plan a variety of different attacks or escapes. Note: This is not a Kawarimi. It does not allow for magical escapes.														
956	1	6	Open Slot																
956	2	1	Wood Clone Technique	Moku Bunshin no Jutsu	Breaking free of the user with violent cracks and splinters, a wooden clone forms from the otherwise jagged edges of wood. Fragmenting off the user's skin, as if a clockwork automaton jolting to life, the clone then takes the exact shape of the user and becomes less rigid all around. Acting as the user, it is useful as both a distraction and a limited offensive option. Note: The clone possesses all of the user's physical statistics (without bonuses), but none of their chakra or mental. It may not use any jutsu at all. Base Effect: Can create two clones. Stage Three Effect: Three clones. Stage Four Effect: Five clones.														
956	2	2	Scattered Leaves Technique	Chiru Konoha no Jutsu	Gathering the leaves around them in close proximity, the user is able to detach and direct them at an opponent. Hardening them through chakra, the effect is such that it resembles being hailed upon by shuriken from multiple directions. The amount of leaves that can be used here is limited, though this should not immediately be seen as a drawback. Able to pick and choose the singular leaves all around them, only the user is aware of what leaves may be used and from where they may be derived. Base Effect: Ten leaves within a 1m radius may be gathered and used in this technique. Stage There Effect: Twenty leaves within a 2m radius. Stage Four Effect: Thirty leaves within a 3m radius. Stage Five Effect: Forty leaves within a 4m radius.														
956	2	3	Wood Element: Splinter Technique	Mokuton: Mokuhen no Jutsu	Forming needles of wood along their fingers, the user is able to throw them at their leisure or use them in conjunction with taijustu to scratch and tear at opponents. Imbued with chakra, they possess the potency of senbon needles with the added benefit of being doubly painful in removing as the wood splinters. Base Effect: Up to four splinters may be created. Stage Three Effect: Eight splinters. Stage Four Effect: Sixteen splinters. Stage Five Effect: Thirty two splinters.														
956	2	4	Open Slot																
956	2	5	Leaf Wall Technique	Konoha Kabe No Jutsu	Rising out of the ground in a tangled web in front of the user, several branches intertwine and sprout a vast amount of leaves. These leaves are reinforced with chakra and serve as a shield to guard any behind it. Its durability is unquestionably secure despite how it was created, but it the area it covers leaves much to be desired. At most, it can only ward attacks away from only the user. Base Effect: Can block Stage 1 Techniques. Stage Three Effect: Stage 2 Techniques. Stage Four Effect: Stage 3 Techniques. Stage Five Effect: Stage 4 Techniques.														
956	2	6	Open Slot																
956	3	1	Wood Element: An Insight	Mokuton: Takken	Upon learning the intricate nature required in the composition of wood through chakra, the user is able to implement this into more advanced techniques. Manufactured in appearance, the wood created at this level can be fractured from all over the user's body, resulting in a multitude of mundane uses. However, as in the previous stage, the wood that the user is able to produce by simple chakra manipulation has no real use and, when not focused through a technique, is nothing more than aesthetic. Only through more refined chakra control and direction can the wood here be used in any meaningful way, and at this point the user's creations are amateur in appearance, with no touch of refinement in the production of the wood (unless, again, represented in the form of a jutsu). Notes: This technique gives access to further Mokuton and swaps (Stages 3 and 4). It is not a jutsu in and of itself, but is required if one seeks to take any Mokuton in these stages. Examples of what can and can't be done at this level are taken from the jutsu that follow. One minor addition in this stage is that the user is able to create and shed greater amounts of wood from their body to create simple objects like blocks and beams. This is a non-combat ability and serves no purpose outside aesthetic value. Moreover, these objects may be only very simple in design.														
956	3	2	Leaf Genesis	Konoha Okori no Jutsu	By focusing their chakra, the user can create a large amount of leaves within his/her body, which is promptly spewed out in a manner similar to a Katon or Suiton. These leaves can be used in the variety of different techniques that require them. Base Effect: Can create enough leaves to perform up to Stage 4 techniques. Stage Four Effect: Can create enough leaves to perform up to Stage 5 techniques. Stage Five Effect: Can create enough leaves to perform up to Stage 6 techniques.														
956	3	3	Wood Element: Woodcutter Technique	Mokuton: Kikori no Jutsu	As the namesake implies, this jutsu allows the user to fashion a blade that extends from their forearm (akin to a concealed wrist blade). Unlike natural wood in its texture and resilience, this wood juts out to a fine point, its edges clean and sharp. In effect, it has the added benefit of being able to deflect basic weapons. Base Effect: Blade may extend up to 40cm. Stage Four Effect: Two blades may be created; one per arm. Stage Five Effect: Blades may extend up to 80cm.														
956	3	4	Leaf Clone Technique	Konoha Bunshin no Jutsu	A more complex bunshin with fewer applications, it is a wonder why this technique was developed at all. As a rule of thumb, bunshin were developed as a means of distraction, and eventually perfected to perform ideally in those roles. This technique, however, simply allows the user to clone himself and then use said clones to synchronize his other jutsu into a more strategic offensive. Gathered from the leaves around the user, the clone forms and is brittle to the touch, possessing very little in the way of physical composition. If anything, it's quite frail in comparison to most other bunshin and is probably the most easily felled as well. Note: This bunshin possesses 1 of each physical stat, but retains all of the user's chakra and mental. It is able to use one jutsu the user knows, but then crumbles into a pile of leaves immediately afterwards. Base Effect: One bunshin is created. Stage Four Effect: Two bunshin. Stage Five Effect: Three bunshin that now possess 1/10 the user's physical stats as well as all their chakra and mental are created.														
956	3	5	Leaf Dragon Technique	Ryuuko No Jutsu	A somewhat fanciful technique, it is nonetheless quite dangerous if used correctly. Developed at first as a defensive counter, the user at first gathers leaves around them and infuses them with chakra, hardening them considerably. Swirling around the user in a torrent of green, the leaves deter any projectiles that may be aimed at the user, and then finish their rotation by arcing around the user in slingshot fashion towards the opponent. Guiding them using chakra, the leaves fly forth in the general shape of a snake with the head of a dragon, its scales glittering jade. Striking the opponent dead-on could prove fatal since the leaves are sharp enough to pierce the skin, but otherwise this jutsu can slice very easily as well. Note: This may also be used as a stand-alone attack.														
956	3	6	Open Slot																
956	4	1	Great Wood Clone Technique	Moku Daibunshin no Jutsu	A semi-liquid molding peels off the user and solidifies as it transforms into their exact replica. In this form, the clone is much more capable of carrying out its purpose of providing a healthy distraction, but is also reinforced by the fact that it can deal quite a bit of damage through the usage of jutsu. Not far advanced from its predecessor, it again only now possesses the ability to use an inkling of the user's repertoire for itself. Note: The clone possesses all of the user's physical statistics (without bonuses), and only Ã‚Â½ of their chakra and mental. It may use one jutsu the user owns and that it possesses the statistics for and explodes into a cloud of sawdust afterwards that causes significant irritation to anyone within arm's reach. This same effect is made apparent when it is destroyed, as well. Base Effect: Can create one clone.														
956	4	2	Wood Element: Step Through Technique	Mokuton: Nakahehairu no Jutsu	A rather useful jutsu by all accounts, it allows the user to step into a tree and meld into it. From there, traveling through the roots or by its branches, the user can appear through another tree. What's more is that any wood can be used in this technique, regardless of the physical limits of that wood. So, for example, the beams within a building may be used, or even the floorboards. It cannot be substituted as a means of transportation for the sole fact that it would require far too much chakra, but its uses are plentiful regardless. Notes: The user can only travel as fast as their own speed, and does not instantaneously appear in one place or another. Also, the user may not attack while traveling in this form. Base Effect: Lasts at least four posts. Stage Five Effect: Five posts. Stage Six Effect: Six posts.														
956	4	3	Wood Element: Wood Bind Technique	Mokuton: Mokushibari no Jutsu	Flowing from his palm swiftly, a wooden beam hurries forth and attempts to wrap around an opponent to either greatly limit their movement, or capture them entirely. Limited by distance, the secondary effect of this technique is retrieval (although the definition of 'capture' may be broad enough in this sense as well). In the instance where an ally or object is being retrieved, the wood is noticeably less resilient and unnaturally supple to the touch so as to not damage the target. However, in the case of capture, the wood is unerringly rigid and extremely durable. Notes: The wood travels at the speed of the user's control + Ã‚Â½ their reserves. In order to break free of the binding, the opponent must have higher strength (without bonuses) than the user's power (though an opponent may still be temporarily bound even if their strength is greater than the user's power). Base Effect: Extends up to 10m. Stage Five Effect: 20m. Stage Six Effect: 30m.														
956	4	4	Wood Element: Swift Transport Technique	Mokuton: Jinsoku Yusou no Jutsu	Sprouting forth from the ground under the user's feet, a wooden beam wide enough to support the weight of the user dashes through the air and stretches up, down, and around to carry them to a given destination. Not exceptionally conventional as a means to travel, it is mostly a combat-oriented and serves the purpose of removing the user from immediate harm's way, bridging gaps, or reaching otherwise hard-to-reach places. Base Effect: Travels at user's base speed. Stage Five Effect: Base speed + Ã‚Â½ bonuses. Stage Six Effect: Full speed.														
956	4	5	Wood Element: To Melt Into	Mokuton: Tokekomu	A peculiar though nonetheless effective defensive technique, it is activated as soon as the user feels an offense about to strike their person. Forming along their pores, a thick, plaster-like substance oozes forth from the point of contact, dampening the blow considerably, and attaches onto the assailant. Like a parasite, the plaster swarms around the user's foe and traps their movements, immediately hardening into wood. The reprieve is only momentary, though, as the technique is meant to last only as a means of warding off attack. The wood manifested here is created so quickly that its durability is such that it lasts only long enough for the user to remove himself from harm's way.														
956	4	6	Leaf Instantaneous Body Technique	Konoha Shunshin No Jutsu	An ability which allows the user to transport from one area to another in a veil of leaves. The user has to have been to the area before, and be able to sense the location with his own chakra before being able to transport himself there. This means that the distance is limited to about one mile.														
956	5	1	Wood Element: An Understanding	Mokuton: Bunmei	At this point in time, the user is not only intimate with the fundamentals of Mokuton, but is able to manipulate them to any given situation. Filling a key-hole with a plaster-like material that eventually hardens and molds into the shape of the key is but a singular example of how the wood may be used now. Sculpting more intricate objects such as chairs and tables is now possible as well. In the form of jutsu, this allows the shinobi to exercise the full breadth of their creativity, able now to call upon and create wood by the simple virtue of their chakra (fashioning a handful of projectiles is but a mundane task that requires little focus or manipulation). Also at this stage, the user's wood takes on a more processed style, giving it a more fluid, albeit angular shape: its texture is smooth, but its strength is near that of iron due to being reinforced with chakra. Lastly, it is at this level that the true genius of Shodai Hokage is realized, as the conventional and offensive applications of wood are made real through near-mastery. Notes: This technique gives access to further Mokuton and swaps (Stages 5 through 6). It is not a jutsu in and of itself, but is required if one seeks to take any Mokuton in these stages. Examples of what can and can't be done at this level are taken from the jutsu that follow. The ability to create non-combat objects has increased as well to include more complex shapes. The limit, however, is judged per the situation. In the example of creating a key, the same method could not be used to somehow open a high-security vault that more complex locking mechanisms. Again, the usage of this particular ability is mostly aesthetic and has no legitimate combat application.														
956	5	2	Wood Element: Shifting Labyrinth Technique	Mokuton: Tenshin Meikyuu no Jutsu	Requiring a considerable amount of chakra, the user extends it across the battlefield; in particular the distance between him and his opponent(s). Using a combination of sight and extrasensory perception to 'feel' through his chakra, whenever an opponent steps onto this invisible field their path will be impeded by a square pillar (about 1.5m squared, and 4m high) that rises up swiftly and without warning in front of them (directly vertical or even diagonal). The obvious effect here is that they'll step into it and not only look quite foolish, but the wooden pillar is founded so deeply in the earth and hardened through chakra that depending on the opponent's approach, it can hurt quite a bit. Even if the opponent were to duck around the pillar, it would simply extend horizontally on either side to either catch their movements or collide with them violently. Even rising above it would certainly result in some harm as they would have to touch ground sometime, this in turn resulting in yet another pillar rising up quickly to catch their descent. With further training, the user can set up a literal maze which the opponent must maneuver skillfully or be smashed between two pillars. Note: While this technique is in use, no other techniques may be used. 18 Power: May create up to six pillars. -25 Power: Ten pillars. --32 Power: Twelve pillars. 17 Control: Area of influence is limited to about a 25m radius. -25 Control: A 35m radius. --33 Control: A 45m radius. 17 Reserves: Can be used once a thread. -26 Reserves: Twice a thread. --35 Reserves: Three times a thread.														
956	5	3	Wood Element: Exploding Volley Technique	Mokuton: Bakuretsu Seisha no Jutsu	Finishing a modest amount of hand seals with Ram, the user throws our their hands and creates arm length shards that form rapidly and fire in fierce volleys. Sharpened and hazardously created, (a scratch from these is bound to leave dangerously-sized splinters) their main purpose is to brutally impale an opponent. The truly dangerous aspect of this technique, though, is that with prolonged training and mastery, each shard becomes hollow in the middle and filled with explosive chakra. Upon impact (or if the user is apt enough) the shards detonate and senbon-strength shrapnel litters the immediate area. Of course, as with most of Mokuton, removing these splinters from ones person is excruciatingly painful and tends to tear larger wounds than normal. Power 19: Shards are solid. -Power 26: Shards may fracture into two in mid air. --Power 33: Shards may be hollow and detonate, releasing shrapnel into the air. Control 19: Can fire up to ten volleys. -Control 27: Up to twenty volleys. --Control 35: Up to thirty volleys. Reserves 18: --- -Reserves 27: Shards detonate on impact. --Reserves 36: Shards detonate on cue.														
956	5	4	Wood Element: Evergreen	Mokuton: Jouryoku	As further study of Mokuton is established through increasing levels of mastery, the user becomes more tuned to the forces of nature that guide it. With the eternal strength of the earth, trees adapt and flourish in environments of all seasons. Be it the blistering heat of summer, the melancholy preparation of autumn, the frigid caress of winter, or the sweet pepper of spring: trees and their offspring live on. Taking this lesson and apply it to their Mokuton, the user is now able to fashion his creations in such a way that even if it were cast in flames, drowned in water, weathered by wind (and so on and so forth), it would remain seemingly unaffected. With this, the user is able to extend the essence of what it means to be 'evergreen' to all his creations, and in so doing insures their reliability in any battle.														
956	5	5	Convert Photosynthesis	Kaeru Kougousei	By virtue of its resilience and ability to sprout life in almost any given environment, trees and their associated parts have often been looked to as a sign of health and prosperity. Taking this lesson to heart, the shinobi of Konoha are able to gather into their hands leaves of any sort and, combined with their own chakra, release all the restorative powers of the forest in them. Used to cauterize wounds, dampen internal bleeding, or even purge blood of toxins, the leaves used here are highly regenerative in nature and can even be compared to a natural variant of Chiyute no Jutsu, albeit requiring slightly more skill to use properly. Note: The aesthetic use of this jutsu is several. Edible, used as a cream, in liquid form; all are fair game in how this jutsu is used to treat whichever wound, so long as it is appropriate to that type of wound.														
956	5	6	Shadow Leaf Clone Technique	Kage Konoha Bunshin no Jutsu	An extremely advanced version of the original Konoha Bunshin, this bunshin is equipped with a variety of benefits and skills. Composed of the leaves from the surrounding area, this bunshin is not contained to being created solely near the user. Instead, wherever there are leaves, the user may will a bunshin of this caliber to life. Next to that, the properties of this bunshin are that it is composed of a type of leaves that when dealt (or dealing) a blow, they will disperse from the point of contact and attach onto an opponent and attempt to bind their movements. That is the least of an opponent's troubles, though, as when this bunshin is destroyed it will explode in a haze of leaves gone shrapnel, puncturing and piercing all within an effective range of 10 meters. Note: This bunshin possesses all the stats of the user, though only 1/5 their taijutsu bonuses. All other effects are put to scale. 16 Power: Can use one jutsu the user knows before dissipating in a wisp of smoke. -23 Power: --- --30 Power: Can use two jutsu. 18 Willpower: Binding effect reduces the opponent's Speed by one level for two posts. -26 Willpower: Binding effect reduces the opponent's Speed by one level for three posts. --34 Willpower: Binding effect reduces the opponent's Speed by two levels for two posts. 19 Intelligence: Can create 1 bunshin. -28 Intelligence: Two bunshin. --37 Intellgeince: Three bunshin.														
956	6	1	True Wood Clone Technique	Moku Shinbunshin no Jutsu	Up until this moment, creating a clone has been nothing more than a parlor trick. Temporary in their existence, bunshin are nothing more than tools manifested for specific tasks appropriate to the situation. What this technique does is imbue not only chakra into a clone, but the user's essence as well. In this way, the clone becomes a part of the user, something more than a corporeal representation. At any given moment the user may occupy the bodies of his clones through this connection, later retreating to the safety of his person on a whim. Moreover, they can experience things firsthand from the point of view of their clone, therefore making it ideal in certain situations that require tact. Its means of creation, though, are slightly more complicated than normal. Focusing every bit of their consciousness, the user manifests their chakra in any piece of wood around them. Be it from the trunk of a tree, the floorboards of a building, or even previous Mokuton, the clone must be created from these and not simply spawned from the user's body as in previous jutsu. This obviously requires slightly more preparation than usual and is preferably done under some sort of guard or cover. However, the versatility of these bunshin are rivaled only by those of Kage Bunshin, which is, ironically, what the founders of this jutsu were trying to emulate. Note: It takes one post of preparation to create any amount of bunshin. All other effects are put to scale. 21 Power: Each bunshin possesses all the stats of the user, though limited to Ã‚Â½ their taijutsu bonuses. -28 Power: A single bunshin may possess all the stats of the user, though limited to Ã‚Â¾ their taijutsu bonuses. --35 Power: A single bunshin may possess all the stats of the user, but only that bunshin may be created. 20 Control: Can be used once a thread. -28 Control: Can be used twice a thread. 19 Reserves: One bunshin may be created. -27 Reserves: Two bunshin. --36 Reserves: Three bunshin.														
956	6	2	Wood Element: Bending Technique	Mokuton: Kunekune no Jutsu	Willing any piece of wood around them trough the innate bond built by use of Mokuton, the user is able to 'bend' it to a limited extent to serve their purpose. Tree branches may cross together to prevent or impede progress through an area, forcing an opponent to take a more terrestrial route, for example. Natural wood that is already part of the environment may only be manipulated in this very simple sense, but wood that the user has fashioned through their own techniques is a different matter altogether. Considering the size and shape of the object in question, the shinobi is able to diminish its mass (not increase), and may bend and manipulate it in more functional ways. Taking an obtuse block of wood and fashioning it into a ramp or vice versa is an example of how this skill works. Note: This is not complete manipulation, but should be regarded more as subtle. A block of wood cannot be transformed into a working cabinet with hinges and sliding drawers, for example. But that same block can be fashioned into a spiked ball with ease. As the pace of the technique might suggest, these transformations are done swiftly and thus the intricate nature of many objects is lost at such speeds. Formations are the most complicated maneuvers the user may make use of, whereas most objects (such as the cabinet mentioned above) are simply too complex to appropriately manufacture.														
956	6	3	Wood Element: Rampant Overgrowth Technique	Mokuton: Boubou Futorisugi no Jutsu	A somewhat simple technique, the method put to use here is instead one that draws upon the user's ability to mold their chakra quickly and in abundant amounts to achieve the desired effect. After performing the necessary seals (a short sequence ending with Ram), the user throws his arm forward as if grasping thin air and produces, from his shoulder onward, an extremely long and wide beam. This initial spear then branches into several more as it travels, winds, splits and grows onward. The measure of this impaling technique is quite wide, and extends across vast distances. In effect, the technique is similar to having a downed tree with hacked branches hurled at you, repeatedly. The only thing is that the jutsu requires that the entirety of the user's arm be used while this technique is being maintained, which ostensibly means he cannot move around while it is in use. Note: The maximum length of this technique is 100m.														
956	6	4	Leaf Sniper Technique	Konoha Sogekihei no Jutsu	Holding a leaf flat against their index and middle finger, the user is able to aim it and launch it with incredible force. Reinforced and sharpened by chakra, this single leaf possess astonishing cutting power, and is capable of penetrating through nearly any material that may impede its progress. Due to how thin it is and the sheer speed with which it travels, slicing through most barriers possesses absolutely no problems for this bullet. Striking a person may have little to no effect, but if the leaf were to pierce a vital organ, a swift death is insured. Further training makes this technique even more deadly, though, as the user is able to make use of multiple leaves in this manner. However, as the strength of the jutsu might indicate, it requires not only a great amount of chakra, but a fair amount of time to prepare as well. Power 17: May pierce S5 defensive techniques. -Power 24: S6 defensive techniques. --Power 31: S7 defensive techniques. Control 15: One leaf may be used in this technique. -Control 23: Two leaves. --Control 31: Four leaves.														
956	6	5	Great Leaf Whirlwind Technique	Kyoha Senpuu no Jutsu	Summoning a torrent of leaves around him, the user whirls them through the air with their chakra. Further hardening them with chakra, the leaves become steel-like in composition, tearing and shredding through everything they come into contact with. The whirlwinds may further be controlled, aimed in a direction, or made to hover about the user as a means of protection. Rather simple in approach, it is nonetheless a devastating technique. 22 Willpower: The whirlwind may measure up to 5m in height, and 2m in diameter. -29 Willpower: The whirlwind may measure up to 7m in height, and 3m in diameter. --38 Willpower: The whirlwind may measure up to 10m in height, and 5m in diameter 16 Power: One whirlwind may be created. -24 Power: Two whirlwinds. --32 Power: Three whirlwinds. 15 Reserves: The technique may be maintained for three posts. -24 Reserves: Four posts. --33 Reserves: Five posts

956	7	1	Wood Element Secret Art: Mastery	Mokuton Hijutsu: Jukutatsu	Fabled to have fashioned the very foundations of Konoha, Shodai Hokage was known as more than a genius of his time, but a visionary as well. Even today his creations live on, most notably in the Forest of Death which has claimed home and final resting place for many throughout the ages. But most importantly, this stage marks the first time that life has been fashioned from these techniques. In previous levels, the wood was nothing more than a medium, a mere imitation. Here, though, the wood created lives and breathes as an entity all its own. Literally creating a forest is possible at this level, though it should be noted that only Shodai was ever able to achieve that. More appropriately, all other shinobi who have achieved this level are capable of creating life, finally giving their Mokuton the look and feel of naturally-grown trees. Pressing their hand onto bare earth, or feeling the soft pulse of life within any medium, the user is able to miracurously grow thick, wooden tendrils encased in bark and dotted with curly branches. Immediately setting, these creations can go on to live long lives and even produce other such trees through the seeds that sprout at their very crown. Note: This stage allows the user to create up to three of these tendrils in any formation they so wish so long as their proximity is within a 2m radius of the user. At their fullest height/length, they stretch to about 3m, and are able to withstand quite a bit of punishment due to the nature of their creation. This level of mastery allows the user to take Stage 7 Mokuton and swaps, but the ability it entails is more that of Stage 6 (hence its usage is gauged as such).														
956	7	2	Wood Element: Backlash Barrier Technique	Mokuton: Hanpatsu Shouheki no Jutsu	Within Mokuton is the unique versatility of an exceptionally firm defense paired with an extremely flexible offense. This technique takes advantage of both practices. Holding out their hands in front of them and Fashioning a large disc-like buckler, the user braces for impact and let's his shield absorb the full brunt of the attack, all the while focusing more and more chakra into it. Afterwards, the disk shrivels into a seed and embeds itself in the ground. Focusing their chakra, the user reveals the secret of the technique: having absorbed the kinetic energy from the shield, the user molds it through the seed and converts it, causing the seed to spontaneously grow and transform rapidly. Erupting from the ground all around the opponent, wild tendrils of forest whip and lash, attempting to impale or crush the opponent in their impossible growth. Each tendril possesses the size and near-shape of a fully grown tree, although it bends and contorts in normally impossible ways to achieve its goal of destroying whoever might wish harm upon the user.														
956	7	3	Wood Element: Savage Briar	Mokuton: Moaku Ibara	A rather extreme jutsu, it requires a great amount of effort to control and has the potential to decimate entire battalions of shinobi when used properly. Performing a complex series of handseals, the user plants his hand in the ground to initiate the jutsu. Grinding the very earth with his chakra, he illustrates the strength and lethality of his Mokuton by having them grow out of the ground in copious amounts. Barbed and spiked, large chutes erupt and aim to pierce the opponent in a tangle of wood. This technique affects a wide area and the user himself is put in a somewhat precarious situation as his hands must remain buried throughout the entirety of the jutsu. But with this technique, the user is able to devastate the entire landscape within a 50m radius of his person.														
956	7	4	Wood Element: Wild Tangle Technique	Mokuton: Jisei Matsuri no Jutsu	In terms of binding and 'prison' techniques, none are as efficient or powerful as Jisei Matsuri. Considered even a sealing jutsu, this jutsu causes the ground around an opponent to shift and churn as up to a dozen wooden beams rise up from the ground in rapid succession and wrap around an opponent to completely disable them (typically, limbs are bound individually, followed by the neck and torso, but any combination is acceptable). No amount of strength, agility, or supernatural manipulation of chakra can break these wooden chains, for they are reinforced beyond a doubt with its ever-increasing verdant nature. These wood bindings extend for an incredible length, for they are narrow and their path is easily controlled. Should an opponent miraculously evade them, the user may have them burrow underground, pave through even stone, cement, or metal: all to reach an opponent.														
956	7	5	Wood Element: Spore	Mokuton: Houshi	Vastly different than many of the techniques available within the Mokuton practice, this one works less in terms of blunt trauma and more along the lines of the biological. Invasive in every way, shape, and form, the user may break and shatter any wood on the scene, be it by their own machinations or otherwise, and grounds them up so finely with their chakra that they become miniscule and impossible to detect. Akin to even an extremely fine, odorless mist, this concoction spreads through the air and is inhaled copiously. The doubled effect of this jutsu occurs at this point, as when it enters the lungs and bloodstream (through oxygen), the user recombines it within the opponent, creating jagged splinters that completely obliterate the opponent's internal organs. Within Konoha, it is forbidden to use this technique against even yuke-nin, for the pain caused by this technique is beyond any imagining, and the technique itself is brutal to the point of perversion. But there have been occasions when particular traitorous wretches have been subjugated to this technique's obviously potent consequence.														
956	7	6	Open Slot																
952	1	1	Cell Hardening	-Saibou Katame	The Celestial Body of the Sanada's is very sensitive to chakra variations and therefore reacts accordingly when exposed to these changes in energy flux. By constantly emitting chakra, the user can harden his cells (dermis, flesh and bones) to an extent, making him slightly more resistant to attacks. The Cell Hardening ability is also a requirement for some other skills.														
952	1	2	Metamorphosis	-Hensei	Prerequisites: Saibou Katame Altering the shape and consistency of the cells of a limb, the user moulds them into something else, usually a weapon - for instance, fingers can be come claws, hands can become daggers, the whole arm a katana or a spear. However, the volume of the morphed object can in no case exceed that of the original altered limb. Stage 1: Only hands can be forged into weapons. Stage 2: Both arms and legs can be forged into weapons. Notes: - Additional limbs created cannot be altered with Hensei. - The shape shifting process takes a full post.														
952	1	3	Regeneration	-Taisha	This is the technique which allows Sanada to basically 'recycle' any dead cells or excess fat into chakra, allowing the user to have higher than average Stamina and thus enabling him to be physically fit for a relatively longer time than the average person.

952	2	1	Rapid Blood Clot	-Jinsoku Gyouketsu	Prime method of the Sanada to stop haemorrhages, this technique involves concentrating chakra at the bleeding spot to accelerate the process of blood clotting. At higher levels, the process is a bit more complex that that, thus making it possible to instantly seal larger open wounds. Higher levels of the skills require the enhanced cell division mechanism, accelerating the formation of cells responsible for coagulation of blood and concentrating them at the desired wounded area. The lost blood can also be compensated by formation of newer blood cells. Here is how the jutsu's effectiveness varies. Stage 2: Bleeding from minor cuts and bruises can be stopped. Stage 3: Bleeding from regular cuts and bruises can be stopped. Stage 4: Bleeding from deep cuts (to the bone) can be stopped. Stage 5: Bleeding at vital organs and veins can be instantly stopped.														
952	2	2	Nervous Disorder	-Shikeshou	By temporarily altering the number of nerve cells/receptors present at a specific area of a body, the Sanada can control the degree of pain/heat/cold at will, whether it involves completely suppressing these feelings or drastically amplify them. Stage 2: Users are only able to modify the concentration of nerve cells in their arms. Stage 3: Users are able to modify the concentration of nerve cells anywhere in their body. Note: This ability only alters the feeling of pain and in no-manner avoids damage to that area. e.g. If a Sanada uses the technique to suppress pain and gets his arm broken, he won't feel anything but his arm will still be useless (obviously).														
952	2	3	Mask	-Kamen	Very similar to Henge no Jutsu, this technique differs in that the Sanada alters the structure of cells of his face, making him look like a different person. While this technique isn't dispelled with a hit like Henge, it is only facial appearance which can be changed. Other features, such as height, remain unaltered by the technique.

952	3	1	Genesis	-Souseiki	Prerequisites: Hensei The Sanada Clan members possess a unique and improved cell division mechanism which carries several advantages with it. Generally, during the normal process of cell division, a parent cell will split into two identical daughter cells, having the same characteristics of the parent cell. These daughter cells can eventually split to form grand daughter cells and so on. However, this process occurs differently in the Sanada's Celestial Body. In the case of Sanada clansmen, the parent cell divides into four daughter cells instead of just two. This abnormality dramatically increases the rate of cell division and thus greatly promotes the accelerated formation of new cells. This accelerated cell division is essentially a passive ability, the Sanada being able to use it at will. Genesis refers to the ability of the Sanada to use those newly created cells to create solid weapons from his own cells. Usually, the user simply pulls out a chunk of flesh from his own torso and eventually shapes it into a weapon of his choice. The maximum size of the weapons varies depending on ability. Stage 3: Up to 5 daggers can be created at a time. Stage 4: A weapon the length and size of a katana can be created. Stage 5: A weapon the length and size of a spear can be created.														
952	3	2	Rebirth	-Shinsei	Derived directly from the Enhanced Cell Division, this ability enables amazing self regeneration. Since the cell division process of the Sanada clansmen is much faster than in a normal corporeal envelope, Rebirth allows the ninja to create new cells to repair/replace damaged cells and thus heal relatively minor injuries on his body by using this technique. Stage 3 Heals regular cuts and bruises. Stage 5 Deep wounds can be healed up and damaged areas repaired.														
952	3	3	Evolution	-Kaiku	Using his cell manipulation abilities, the user is able to recreate the structure of an arm. By creating new nerve cells and connecting the limb(s) to his brain, he is able to control those arms to give him an edge in battle. Those additional arms can be extended only from the thoracic cage region, allowing a wider range of possibilities to the user. The arms can be detached at will. Stage 3: 2 additional arms Stage 4: 3 additional arms Stage 5: 4 additional arms Note: The maximum number of additional arms which can be sustained at any instant is 4.

952	4	1	Advanced Evolution	-Fukuzatsu Kaiku	Prerequisites: Kaiku As its name suggests, this technique is a much more advanced version of Kaiku. It enables the user to replicate the structure of any sort of appendage, including more complex ones - additional legs, tails, dorsal projection, etc - instead of just arms. What's more, those additional limbs can now be projected anywhere from the body of the user giving him an even more impressive range of combat possibilities. However, the size of the created appendages is still limited to the volume of arms possible to create with Kaiku. In other words, the maximum size of the created limbs for: Stage 4 would be equivalent to 2 additional arms. Stage 5 would be equivalent to 3 additional arms. Stage 6 would be equivalent to 4 additional arms. Note: Limbs can be detached at will.														
952	4	2	The All-Seeing Eye	-Zenchi no Me	Using his cell manipulation abilities, the user is able to recreate the structure of an eye and is able to connect it to his brain by forming new nerve cells. The eye can be attached anywhere on the body, wherever the user thinks it is most suitable. For instance, the angle of vision can be increased by creating on the back of the head. Stage 5: Two eyes can be created.														
952	4	3	Advanced Metamorphosis	-Fukuzatsu Hensei	Prerequisites: Hensei At this level of mastery of the bloodline, Sanada clansmen now possess enough control to freely manipulate cells not only from their original body but also those in the limbs created through Kaiku and Fukuzatsu Kaiku - and this at very rapid rates. In other words, they can instantly alter the shape and structure of any part of their body and turn it into a weapon of destruction.

952	5	1	Celestial Rebirth	-Ten Shinsei	Prerequisites: Shinsei A more refined version of Shinsei, this technique enables Sanada to repair and replace cells to a much higher extent than the basic ability, such that it is now possible to effectively heal relatively more dangerous injuries and conditions. Control 16: Deep wounds can be healed up and damaged areas repaired. In addition, severed limbs can be regenerated within 1 post. Control 23: Lethal conditions can be neutralized. However, once the damage is repaired, the user will still be incapacitated for the rest of the thread due to recovery time. Control 30: Lethal conditions can be instantly healed to normal condition without any need for recovery time. Note: Lethal conditions can only be healed once per thread.														
952	5	2	Second Life	-Ni Seisai	This ability enables the Sanada to control separated limbs/weapons - created from Evolution and Souseiki - consisting of his own cells and which still contain some of his chakra with hand seals. The actions he can perform with this technique, however, are only limited to moving them and throwing them like projectiles. Note: The maximum number of posts for which chakra remains present in the cells after they are separated from the main body is 4 posts.														
952	5	3	Cocoon	-Mayu	Prerequisites: Saibou Katame Using their ability to create new cells, the Sanada have come up with a unique defensive structure to protect them from attacks. By dramatically accelerating the creation of several layers of new dermis cells around their current one, the user can surround himself a cocoon-like structure which is in turn made extremely tough through the cell hardening mechanism. The cocoon can sustain taijutsu attacks from an opponent with Strength level equal to Stamina level of the Sanada. It can also block Ninjutsu attacks one stage lower than the highest known Stage in this list.

952	6	1	Aspect of the Snake	-Hebi no Jisou	This ability enables the Sanada to alter the structure of his cells, literally allowing his body to change physical state to an extent, becoming more elastic in nature. Although all it does against physical is act as a mild cushion which slightly decreases pain and damage done, its primary function is to grant the user unparalleled body flexibility, allowing him to twist his body in unimaginable positions. The ability allows, amongst other things, movement about the elbow or knee joints in three planes instead of one, full rotation about the neck, etc. Twisting a Sanada's arm or neck to break it is essentially useless.														
952	6	2	Reincarnation	-Tensei	-Requires opponent permission to use. While the name might be somewhat misleading, it is basically the simplest way people have found to describe this new level of the Sanada Bloodline, which can only be mastered by the very best of the clan. Tensei is a mandatory prerequisite for all subsequent skills since it is this ability which enables the Sanada to essentially disintegrate their own body frame, allowing them to fuse with other living organisms and re assume their original physical form when they're forced out of the body (usually after a maximum of 3 posts) or choose to leave it. Note: - While this technique does allow the user to invade bodies, it is doesn't allow the Sanada to harm or affect the 'host' at all. It is harmless on its own. - The technique requires significant surface of contact between two persons to work.														
952	6	3	Leech	-Hiru	Prerequisites: Tensei (Shinsei and Ten Shinsei for alternative version.) After having invaded a target's body through Tensei, the Sanada will be able to 'feed' on his host's chakra to replenish his own. There is an altered version of this jutsu, where the Sanada uses the 'stolen' chakra to the benefit of his host. While fused with an ally's body cells, the Sanada will use the host's chakra as usual but instead of claiming it as his own, he will use it to heal the wounds of the person basing himself on the principles of Shinsei and Ten Shinsei.

952	7	1	Body Fusion	-Nikutai no Yuugou	Prerequisites: Tensei A special ability, which stems directly from Tensei, Nikutai no Yuugou is the most common assassination method used by Sanada. The main advantage being that the death of the target can easily and wrongly be attributed to natural causes. An advanced shinobi using this technique is able to freely create and destroy the cells and proteins which comprise his opponent's tissue. The user also has the ability to extend his appendages from anywhere on the person's body. However, any major self inflicted wounds caused by his opponent will also affect the user's original body. For this ability to be used, the user must first have invaded the opponent's body with Tensei.														
952	7	2	Parasite	-Kisei	-Requires opponent permission. Kisei is a technique quite similar to the ability Second Life, in that it allows cells previously separated from the body of the Sanada to live on temporarily. The twist with Kisei though is that these cells can be made to fuse into the bodies of targets just like in the case of Tensei. However, due to the limited amount of chakra inside those autonomous cells, they can in no way be used to cause direct harm to the host. The advantage of its use is simply that while his own chakra is still present in those cells, the Sanada can accurately track their location, thus the location of the host. Note: The cells can remain alive (i.e. contain chakra) for a maximum of 3 posts inside the host.														
952	7	3	Degeneration	-Taika	-Requires opponent permission. This horrific ability represents the pinnacle of the Sanada bloodline. Now, instead of simply being able to freely control their cellular structure and altering them at will, the masters of the bloodline are also capable of altering, albeit to a relatively limited extent, the cells of opponents - although just enough to destroy them. Control at this level is such that Sanada clansmen can for a very short instant partially fuse with a target (before being forced out) through mere contact of the hand. Sanada, however, are able to capitalize on this brief opportunity to cause immense damage. Having concentrated destructive chakra in their palms, they take advantage of the instant during which their hands has fused with the opponent's body to channel it into their system. This chakra progressively starts killing the cells of the target - the dermis first starts crumbling away, muscles then stop working until finally body processes cease functioning altogether leading to death. Note: The degeneration process can be halted by a medical ninja treating (with Chiyute no Jutsu) the affected target within 3 post of the 'infection'.

951	1	1	Body Mass Control I		The beginning of study that all Akimichi must know and understand before they can continue on to be considered a clan shinobi. This jutsu allows the Akimichi to increase the size and mass of a certain limb, but due to the inexperience with the ability the Akimichi is limited to either his arms. Length and mass can only be doubled at this stage. This decreases the speed by 1 level														
951	1	2	Improved Metabolism		While the ability to have a fast metabolism isn't anything new to an Akimichi it is this technique that allows them to truly harness its abilities. A rather paradoxical ability for the Akimichi to quickly digest and burn fat in order to regain stamina and while this jutsu can be activated it is known to be with all Akimichi in some way or another, but only a few truly learn to use it to their advantage. This jutsu if taken can be used to quickly digest food or fat in order to gain an extra jutsu in a stage lower than they know.														
951	1	3	Fat Defense I		The second ability the Akimichi begin to learn in order to combat against taijutsu users. Moving a part of the fat to a location about to be hit by a blunt instrument the user uses the part of fat to block it. This only blocks punches or blunt objects from strength level 2 and lower. Can only be used once in a thread

951	2	1	Multi-Size Skill		The true first jutsu that encompasses the entire body of the Akimichi. It is their first offensive ability that while slightly useless on its own it can be altered to be very effective. What this jutsu does is quite simply turns the Akimichi into a ball. While in this form he can't do anything, but he can use it to do various other techniques that can be found later in this list.														
951	2	2	Iron Hair		This isn't really a jutsu that affects the body, but rather affects the hair. This jutsu allows an Akimichi to enhance the proteins in his hair to strengthen them into the hardness of iron, while this isn't affective at the early stages it progresses as the Akimichi's talents become better. This also becomes more useful later down the road. Stage Two: The hair is only as hard as wood Stage Three: The hair is only as hard as simple metals (aluminum) Stage Four: The hair is as hard as metals used in weapons like Katanas Stage Five: The hair is as hard as the strongest metals found (titanium)														
951	2	3	Meat Bullet Tank		Descriptions: The first offensive technique of the Akimichi. Once an Akimichi activates the Multi-Size Skill they can learn to harness this jutsu. Once the skill is active the user places his arms, feet, and head inside his newly expanded body. Once that is done the user begins to rapidly spin his mass into a rolling ball of doom. The Akimichi moves at the same speed he would running and hits with the same strength. It can be maintain for 2 posts at each point requires 2 post cooldown.

951	3	1	Body Mass Control II		This is the second stage of the Akimichi's ability to control the mass of their body parts. Just like the first one this one encompasses the arms, but also adds the legs this time. Again the mass can only double. This also decreases the speed by 1 level														
951	3	2	Submersed Juggernaut		Using the Multi-Size Skill and the knowledge how the Meat Bullet Tank works an Akimichi with this jutsu is able to drill underground and travel to a target and bust through the ground in a surprise attack. This also comes with the flaws, as the Akimichi cannot see while underground and thus doesn't know what is going on above ground and can come up to hit nothing as the opponent has moved or come up to a trap. A truly dangerous technique when used properly or when used incorrectly.														
951	3	3	Dexterity Reclaimed		This technique is to help an Akimichi regain what is once lost. While using Body Mass Control an Akimichi's parts move slower than they would when not enlarged. When this jutsu is activated it creates a shield around the selected body part. This shield allows the Akimichi to regain any lost speed from the low moving part and attack with it as if it was normal size. This jutsu doesn't last forever though, as the strain to keep both jutsu activate is too much for one person and thus it has a limit of 2 posts with a cooldown of 3. Base: 1 Body Part Stage Four: 2 Body Parts Stage Five: 3 Body Parts

951	4	1	Spinning Meat Tank Shield		This is a simple defensive jutsu the user learns to combat ninjutsu. Once the Akimichi is in Multi-Size Skill the user begins to spin rapidly. Once the spinning begins the Akimichi coats chakra all around him in order to coat himself completely in it. It is at this point the defense is started. Even though they are spinning in this form an attack from a form of taijutsu can break this. Base: Can block stage 3 and lower Stage Five: Can block stage 4 and lower Stage Six: Can block stage five and lower														
951	4	2	Needle Meat Tank		A jutsu that can be considered an upgrade to the Meat Bullet Tank, this is the first time the jutsu becomes truly devastating. Once the proper procedures are taken and the Akimichi is ready then the attack begins. The attack is just like the first Meat Tank, except the user is now basically a spinning ball of spiky death. The user hits with the same strength he has and speed he has, but with the added ability for sharp spikes. This jutsu is known to tear up ground as it moves around.														
951	4	3	Fat Defense II		This is the exact same as its brethren jutsu, except the defense has increased to protecting against bladed weapons and strength 25 and lower

951	5	1	Mega-Size Skill		The second and last ability for the Akimichi to increase the entire body. This jutsu is an amalgamation of two jutsu. The first being Multi-Size Skill and the second one being the Body Mass Control. This jutsu allows the user the ability to become a giant and triple his height as well as his weight. It is in this form that he finally reaches the pinnacle of his ability as an Akimichi and is able to do truly dangerous jutsu. 17 Control: Triple Height and Weight 24 Control: 4x Height and Weight 32 Control: 5x Height and Weight														
951	5	2	Hammerfall		This is the first true technique that uses the Mega-Size Skill. It begins once the user is in Mega-Size Skill and then continues on, as the Akimichi begins to turn into a ball and spin. Once the spinning reaches the ideal speed the user launches themselves either in the air or forward with a push of chakra. This turns the Akimichi into a flying ball of doom and can be hard to dodge if the user has progressed enough in this list. The Akimichi hits with no extra strength or anything, but the sheer size of him is what makes this jutsu dangerous.														
951	5	3	Fat Defense III		Another increase in the jutsu line of Taijutsu defense this allows the Akimichi to continue to block swords and blunt weapons and also blocks attack from 35 strength or lower

951	6	1	Atomic Eruption		This is a deviation from what many people believe to be what an Akimichi would do. It starts off when an Akimichi has consumed up to the yellow pill and has gone into Mega-Size Skill. Once that happens the Akimichi begins to spin, as if they are about to do some form of the meat tank. They aren't prepping for such an attack, instead the Akimichi is gathering all of his chakra into the center of his spinning body and pressurizing using the motion of his body and what ability he knows of Leaf's fire jutsu. Once the chakra is ready he releases it much like an atomic bomb. The explosion isn't without flaw, as it can only be controlled to move straight and in only one direction.														
951	6	2	Iron Hair Lances		This is another unique jutsu not similar to the other Akimichi abilities. This starts out like every other jutsu with Mega-Size Skill or any other form. It is when the spinning and the Iron Hair is created that this jutsu starts. Once decent speed is gathered in the spinning Akimichi they release hair out. This hair is launched out in the size of a spear in a 360-degree angle. The Lance fly out at around level 8 speed (Jounin) and are at around the chest of a typical male (About 4'11'').														
951	6	3	Fat Coffin		The round of the abilities one obtains at this stage is the Fat Coffin. While the name may be horrible, its very effective. Once the an Akimichi is in Mega-Size Skill and if the Akimichi is able to grab a hold of one or more opponents then they are able to complete this jutsu. Once in the hold of the Akimichi the opponents begin to be engulfed by what can only be called the Akimichi's fat. After this is done the Akimichi can just fall or leap for extra damage, but once the Akimichi lands on the ground the opponents take damage. Damage taken is equal to the Akimichi's strength level including Tai. Opponent's Permission or Death Enabled Thread required.

951	7	1	Nuclear Eruption		This is exactly like Atomic Explosion, except there are some differences. The first difference is the power of the jutsu. It is now an explosion that could obliterate a village and creates and 360-degree dome. The only problem is the Akimichi is completely destroyed in the process as his body is consumed to ensure the jutsu is complete.														
951	7	2	Earthquake Fist		If an Akimichi put all his ability into enlarging a body part this would be the pinnacle of that ability. With the knowledge they gained through progressing the list the Akimichi have developed this jutsu to surprise and awe opponents and occasionally punch giant summons. This justu creates a arm and fist that rivals in size to some Stage Seven Summons. This fist can destroy small forests and even take out sections of towns. But the strain on to maintain such an arm comes at a cost and the jutsu can only be maintained for two posts with a five post cooldown.														
951	7	3	Fat Defense IV		Just like all the rest in the line defensive techniques. This one finally allows for an Akimichi to give everyone else the same protection, as he grows to the size of 20 feet. Once in this size they do the same thing they have always done in order to ensure the jutsu works perfectly. This allows the Akimichi to defend up to one stage six jutsu and strength of 50 or lower. This post can only be held for 2 posts with a 3 post cooldown.

948	1	1	Shadow Bind	Kage Mane	Continuer: The essential Nara technique, the Kage Mane is a move that commands your own shadow to stretch out and reach for an enemy's shadow and while the shadow's actual movement can't be termed fast, should the two connect, the Nara is then capable of making his opponent mimic all of his actions. This technique lasts for three posts and you may not use other jutsu unless they are stated continuer techniques. The user is also capable of capturing more than one person in the shadow bind - the limits of which are 1 additional person for every rank above genin. Its maximum range is limited to how much shadow is in an area - you are limited to your shadow's total surface area (and the shadows you can connect to) and no more. Also, if the enemy's power is higher than the user's power or the enemy's strength (including tai bonuses) is twice the user's power then the duration assigned to him is cut in half (two posts becomes 1). And should the enemy's strength be 3 times the user's power then the kage mane is too weak to restrain them. The Kage Mane itself moves fairly slowly when compared to ninja of a similar level to the user and thus needs to be employed tactically.														
948	1	2	Shadow Fist	Kage Genko	Continuer: The Shadow Fist technique is usually used as a simple extension of the Kage Mane though it can be used alone. When an enemy becomes captured by the above technique, the user form a fist from the shadows at his enemy's feet and cause it to punch his opponent once. This attack has a strength score equal to the user's strength and may target everyone captured by the Shadow Bind.														
948	1	3	Shadow Film	Kage Maku	This technique is a simple little jutsu used for 'getting the upper hand' on someone - quite literally. The user's shadow becomes a non-conductive surface, the same as if you were standing on an area with nothing on it, a fresh area so to speak. Useful when you're in an enemies battlefield (surrounded by water and mist-nin, grassy planes and grass-nin for example) this technique could give you the small yet helpful edge you need. Curiously, when this technique is active the user can walk without their own shadow moving with them though once you step off the shadow the technique is canceled. It's defense is somewhat limited though and it can only protect the user to a stage of technique they themselves have attained (if you have stage 4, you can block stage 4).

948	2	1	Shadow Fusion	Kage Yuukai	Simple in theory, but slightly harder in execution than the previous level of techniques: effectively when this jutsu is activated the user slinks into the shadows around him and becomes neigh indistinguishable from the darkness he has blended with - the user has literal sunk into his own shadow for this technique. Capable of moving at his normal movement pace, but unable to go where his shadow cannot reach (the operation range is identical to the Kage Mane), the user is afforded with an excellent technique as long as the terrain proves cooperative.														
948	2	2	Shadow Dance	Kage Odori	This jutsu is fundamentally similar to the Bunshin no Jutsu. Like a fishing line, it creates a harmless clone , that mimics the users own actions, like a real shadow. It can be placed in the middle, beginning, or end of the users own shadow. It essentially becomes a bobber, if attacked, the enemy is already in the users shadow, its hand over lapping the person. This can lead into any technique. This is most useful in large areas of shadows, under clouds, trees, etcetera. Depending on how large the person wants the harmless clone to be, the users shadow becomes thinner , typically shorter in range as well.														
948	2	3	Shadow Forge	Kage Tansetsu	At first glance the Shadow Forge appears identical to the kage Mane in every respect. It is started with the same handseal and travels in the same manner and with the same speed. However, with a second hand seal the user causes the Kage Tansetsu to accelerate quickly to a combat pace and as it approaches it's target the shadow lifts off the ground and attempts to impale the target with a blade of raw shadow stuff.

948	3	1	Shadow Weave	Kage Ori	Initiator: An easy technique to explain, the user takes a projectile of some sort and attunes it with their shadow. This projectile now acts as a sort of homing device and when the user throws it his shadow follows up to its maximum length. While this does mean the user's shadow isn't as maneuverable as it usually is, it is possible that the user's shadow can be made to go faster than it usually would if they're good at throwing.														
948	3	2	Shadow Mat	Kage Tami	Even the best laid plans can sometimes go to waste, and as such it's important to be able to defend yourself when they do. The Kage Tami is a simple and incredibly basic technique designed to cover the Nara's hide when everything suddenly starts to go wrong. By manipulating their own shadow they bring it up in front of them and use it as a kind of screen against an attack from one side of them. It may block one attack (be it a tai or a nin) of any stage equal to the user's highest stage -3 (to a minimum of 1).														
948	3	3	Shadow Screen	Kage Kichou	Initiator:As a defensive technique, the Shadow Screen offers a further dynamic to the Nara's tactical arsenal. When this jutsu is performed the user's shadow takes on a distorted quality - almost as if there were ripples in it. When the shadow of a physical object touches the user's shadow this jutsu goes off and effectively activates the Kagemane - attempting to freeze the object in its tracks. The trap will remain active for 1 post + 1 per rank, but as soon as its triggered the effect will last only a single post though since the enemy will be touching your shadow a following Kage Mane shouldn't be hard to accomplish. While this technique is active (and the user can dismiss it at any time like normal) no other shadow skills may be performed.

948	4	1	Shadow Neck Bind	Kage Kubi Shibari	Continuer: The shadow neck bind can only be described as a killing move. When an enemy is trapped by the Kage Mane the user channels his chakra to activate this technique. Hands form out of the shadows and creep across any victim trapped inside the Kage Mane'¦coiling themselves around their throat before slowly choking the life out of them. The victim will fall unconscious in two posts (his next post, then the post after that) and continued asphyxiation will result in death.														
948	4	2	Shadow Trap	Kage Ashikase	Initiator: This technique requires the user to fill a tag as if it were a cup with his own shadow. Though the Tag is constantly bound to the user, since it is a shadow after all. It can be thrown or dropped anywhere, and the user can walk away. The tag can be activated once someone is close enough for the shadow to exit and just bind someone to the ground, keeping them on the floor, or if their close enough, even bind them in Kage Mane. The tag can be thrown as far as the user wants, as long as he can stretch his farther to that point. A small sliver of a shadow constantly follows wherever the tag is until the point its to far. What the technique is doing constantly, is pulling out more and more shadow as the user walks away. If the user stays close to the tag, when someone comes around it can leap out of the tag and extend to long areas. However if you are further away from the tag, unless stepped on, the shadow just cant leap out of the shadow. This technique is canceled by walking to far, which is usually about 30 feet per rank.														
948	4	3	Shadow Sewing	Kage Nui	Different to the other jutsu simply because this is a directly offensive technique, the Kage Nui is performed in much the same manner as the Kage Mane - with a single hand seal the user causes his own shadow to stretch out across the ground at the exact same speed - but with a second hand seal the user is capable of causing his shadow to split into a multitude of tendrils sharp enough to pierce flesh and impale the unwary. A dangerous technique, the user may split his shadow into 1 tendril for every 4 intelligence.

948	5	1	Shadow Un-rooting	Kage Anouen	Continuer: This technique is relatively simple, and almost exactly like shadow film, only on a much larger setting. What it does is slide under any object, and then creates a separate path for the object to slide down, no matter how steep the area their standing on is. It literally pulls the object as if on a treadmill. The shadow is traction-less and when on a separate shadow, the user can bind someone first, slide under any object, and send it rolling at frightening speeds.														
948	5	2	Shadow Drill	Kage Kurinuku	Continuer: This technique can be as useful as its name in itself. The users shadow slides up someone while in kagemane as if going into neckbind, but instead a more typical swirling motion begins on the target. Once finalized, the shadow will literally drill into the person to the users liking, and pull out, the remains of what it dug into plopping against the ground as the shadow reverts to normal. This can be used to drill through bone, or even drill into a bank and steal the money inside, or even dig it out with the hole created														
948	5	3	Back Stab	Kage Senshi	Continuer: A more efficient - and certainly more brutal - version of the Shadow Neck Bind, the Shadow Back Stab functions in a similar manner regardless. This technique creates a knife of shadow that then attempts to stab the trapped foe wherever the user desires and it deals damage equal to what the user would have done by stabbing an opponent with a kunai directly. Unlike the Shadow Neck Bind (which can be done on more than one person), the Shadow Back Stab may only be used on one person and ends the user's Kage Mane after its use.

948	6	1	Shadow Magnet	Kage Jishaku	Continuer: This technique first requires shadow bind. The next step is to send small tendrils onto the enemy, as is miniature shadows attempting to bind. What they do is go after each and every small shadow on the enemy, folds of clothes, shoulder blades, anything. Then, they attempt to connect to the enemy's shadow. Literally everything starts to be pulled down until the pure pressure begins to snap inside them. First, their front is brought down, then their back attempts to attach to their shadow, and begins to snap forward This can work for anything to bring it down, trees can begin to bend or snap, doors being rips off their hinges to slam down. Though this is just an added thing, almost never used for that purpose.														
948	6	2	Shadow Substitute	Kage Migawari	Migawari is a term used in folk law to describe a doll which receives the misfortunes of its owner, and the Kage Migawari could be said to have been named after that particular myth. The user manipulates his shadow and causes it to rise from the ground and 'stand up' as if it were another person (though it is still obviously the user's shadow). The user is capable of directing the shadow to move about as if it was a bunshin, and the technique's primary use is as a solid defence. Essentially, the Substitute gets in the way of an attack and blocks it for better or worse. It has the user's 'stamina' when it comes to taijutsu and when dealing with ninjutsu any attack will subtract its stage from the Substitute's stage and should it reach 0 in that manner the Substitute disappears (even if the stage is higher it will block that one attack). Usually employed as part of a decoy or a diversionary strategy, the Kage Migawari is nevertheless a useful delaying tactic should the Nara be caught unawares. Of course, it goes without saying that as long as the Migawari is active the user's shadow is unavailable for use in other Nara techniques.

948	7	1	Shadow Stride	Kage Oomata	This rather versatile jutsu acts much like a normal ninja's shunshin would. Unlike a shunshin however, the user requires a shadow at least large enough to step into completely to perform this technique and likewise requires the user to be able to see a shadow large enough to completely cover his body to step out of again, and the user cannot move until he has completely exited the shadow. Unlike a regular shunshin however this technique can be used in combat to full effect and makes an effective assault jutsu. This move may only be performed twice per thread.														
948	7	2	Shadow Sentence	Kage Hanketsu	Continuer: Essentially, this is the Nara's ultimate finishing move. As its name suggests, it is a death sentence to all those who are condemned to it. With an enemy trapped by the Kage Mane, the Nara uses this technique in an attempt to leave almost nothing left. Acting almost like a Continuer version of the Kage Nui, this jutsu inserts dozens upon dozens of razor sharp tendrils into the captured enemy - consuming him in shadow - before explosively ripping them apart from the inside out. It would take a man of great stamina to resist these probing tentacles but there is no doubt that the most sure defense against this technique is to avoid the Kage Mane to begin with.														
948	7	3	Shadow Skin	Kage Hifu	Continuer: This technique requires two conditions to be fulfilled before it can be used. Firstly, as stated, the enemy must already be bound by the Kage Mane and secondly they must have at least one open wound on their body. This wound is like a gate way...it's open and therefore light can get inside and with that comes shadow. This of course is a bad thing for the enemy, it allows the Nara to get underneath their skin. Primarly used as a torture jutsu, the effects of this really are quite simple. With the enemy bound, the user works outwards from the open wound and peels away at the surrounding skin. The effect can either be slow and (obviously) torturous but it can also be really quite fast. Fast enough to remove an enemy of his birthday suit before he's even realized what's going on. I shouldn't have to say that being flayed alive is (unless your a sick, invincible monster) usually very lethal indeed.

901	1	1	Arms of the Barrier Reef	Hoshou no Buki	At the beginning stages, there is nothing too out of the ordinary cropping up. The bladesman can create either a pair of rough/jagged armguards or a pair of shinguards that have standard durability. Because of the limited capacity of coral creation, the user can only create a single Item Point worth of weapons and usually comes equipped with his own. The items may be destoyed at any moment. The coral may only be created directly from the forearms or the shins.Because the style is at a basic stage at the given moment, a lot of emphasis is placed upon analysis: hunt for the weak points, identify the joints between the enemy offenses and defences, then proceed to exploit them. Despite being an aggressive style, it's not uncommon for people at this level to simply sit back and wait for the most opportune moment to strike. Training focuses on the fundamentals of strength, following the philosophy that no matter how fast or hardy the enemy is, you can cripple him if with one blow if you're strong enough - even if the opponent is speedy, he has to come to you to attack, and if the opponent is durable, he still has a limit. Knowledge of the obvious weakpoints of the body (groin, eyes, nose) are prime targets for someone of this level as they would be for any person, but on top of those points, the student is trained to locate other points less blatant to the normal bystander.	3					0	0	0	0	0	0	4	4	0
901	2	2	Arms of the Barrier Reef	Hoshou no Buki	Elevated levels of skill and physical ability lead to higher capacities in all things. Even with this small increase in strength, the bladesman is able to create coral amounting to 3 WP total at one time with the same durability as its regular counterpart. The only limitation on this is that the item must be a solid, inflexible, unchanging item, which means wires and whips are off limits. Also, the user cannot create multiple objects at once; they must wait until one item is formed before creating the next. Creation is restricted to the hands, forearms, and shins.Basic, linear attacks are ingrained into the bladesman's mind and body so deeply that they no longer take any conscious thought to execute. The mind expects the body to move in a certain fashion, and the body is guided by the mind's subconscious directions. Eliminating the thought process of "I should attack like this" is key to this style, because as a risky discipline, instinct is necessary to survive. It's all fine and good to know how to attack with the proper form, but all that is useless if it requires active thought to carry out.While they are instructed on various ploys and sleights of hand, this is strictly to teach them what to look for and how to react.	3					0	0	6	0	0	0	8	6	0
901	3	3	Arms of the Barrier Reef	Hoshou no Buki	With quality at an acceptable standard, now quantity increases. Though with most of the same item creation stipulations as in the previous stage, the user can now create coral constructs one at a time up to 5 WP in value and, with the application of Chakra, introduce flexibility to manufacture whips and other flexible arms - although as a discipline of the blade, a sword is what is typically produced. Creation is now increased to the full lengths of the arms as well.Movement is a key aspect to a fight. Without movement, there is no way to fight the enemy. Clumsy, unnecessary steps are eliminated at this stage; dashes and charges with strong footwork and clean follow-throughs are highlighted here. Application of weight is also introduced, because an attack with your body weight put behind it will be heavier than a weak flail of the arm. Vital points are memorized not to transform the style into one of precision, but to teach the bladesman, 'No matter where you cut him, he will bleed - but if you hit him here, he will bleed more.'	3				Coral SporeWhile this technique is active, no other coral item can be made. Focusing the manifestation of coral in his palm, the swordsmen creates a viscous slime that can be coated on other weapons or even slathered over the rest of his hand. The next object that is touched will have the slime seep into the immediate area of contact, and growths of coral will begin to sprout. This can hamper movement or weigh down weapons, or can even be used in reverse to plug up bleeding wounds.	0	0	8	0	0	0	12	8	0
901	4	4	Arms of the Barrier Reef	Hoshou no Buki	By now, the limitless potential of the style is starting to be unlocked as the bladesman can now create up to 7 WP of items in coral fashion, though only one item can be created at a time. They can also increase the complexity of their products, allowing for atypical sword shapes, serrated edges, and/or other minor adjustments. The area of coral creation has now increased again from the arms to the main bodyThe aggression of the style is starting to shine. With the basics either mastered or being close to mastered, they can focus less on themselves and more upon the basic, fundamental duty of the sword: to inflict damage. The swordsmen is taught to never show mercy to those undeserving of it, and that to draw a sword in battle means to never sheathe it until the enemy is dead or you are. Any route is acceptable to achieve that end: aerial attacks, land attacks, sneak attacks, anything goes because it is an offense that wins a fight, not a defense.	3				Narwhale RapierAll other coral creations must be destroyed before this technique can be used (meaning the user must have all 7 WP available for use). Initiating this technique, the bladesman creates a hybrid between a lance and a nodachi between his palms - the coral is a long, spiralling lance, and the edges of the spiral are so fine that they can cut. What makes this so impressive is its ability to actually break the flesh fusion and separate completely from the user and pierce at long range. From thirty feet away, the bladesman can opt to launch the Narwhale Rapier at high speeds in a straight trajectory. The lance will begin to rotate and drill forward, digging and piercing deeply into even armoured objects. This technique has the ability to pierce Ninjutsu one stage below the bladesman's highest level. Once it is released, it will dissipate after one post, allowing the user his pool of WP again.	0	0	14	0	0	0	15	15	13
901	5	5	Arms of the Barrier Reef	Hoshou no Buki	Coral creation continues on in its advances, as now the user can make up to 9 WP of items. He can also now craft multiple items at once with decent complexity, increasing the versatility of this ability. They can now also create items on their head.The bladesman is now a confident fighter, not having to fear even a bit when faced by a group of enemies. They understand that when it comes down to it, no matter how the opponent moves or tries to trick you, the fundamentals of battle remain the same: if they are hit, they are injured, and if they hit you, you are injured. So the bladesman boils combat down to that basic fact and has long ago realized that fights do not need to be fancy; a slash across the throat will do just as well as an elaborate lethal trap. Training the user to not focus on the amount of hits they take is important, as long as they are dishing out some damage in return.	3				Tidehunter (requires Narwhale Rapier)By devoting the entire pool of coral available to him at this stage, the user can cause small coral spines over his body and launch them outwards in a devastating defensive, or maybe even offensive, move. The shards can only go out five feet before crumbling into dust. The dangerous part about this technique is the toll it takes on the body; the user cannot use Tidehunter more than once every three posts.Getting a full blast of this attack would leave your body riddled with bits of coral - even after they dissipate in a post, it will leave the body heavily wounded.	0	0	16	0	0	0	23	18	15
901	6	6	Arms of the Barrier Reef	Hoshou no Buki	Nearing the height of perfection, the user can now create up to 11 WP of items, anywhere on himself, making his entire body into a potential weapon. The coral still cannot part from his flesh, but it is of even higher quality than the finest weaponry forged; with enough time, repeated clashes of a coral construct blade against a regular sword will leave the latter chipped and potentially cracked.At this point, the bladesman is a fearsome gladiator who thrusts himself into the thick of battle to destroy his foe. His sword is a machine of blind destruction, obliterating everything in its path as its bearer's slashes and thrusts become more unadulterated in power. He is not a simple warmongering brute who jumps into every fight he can. Rather, he is a true warrior who revels not to stand in battle, but to stand after the battle has ended. He fights the necessary battles, and fights to win them, using his entire body to reach that point.	3				Ocean StingBy investing the entirety of WP from his maximum pool value, the bladesman can create a two to three-foot razor sharp sting from his palm or arm. The sting is coated in a toxin that induces cellular lysis when the sting cuts/stabs a living being. The lysis is restricted to the immediate area of injury and causes the flesh there to wither away painfully as the cells burst. The sting can be held indefinitely, but once it is cancelled, cannot be used again in the same thread.	16	0	20	0	0	0	30	25	20
901	7	7	Arms of the Barrier Reef	Hoshou no Buki	The user now has a pool of 13 WP to play with. He can manufacture coral constructs anywhere on his skin, with the same quality as the previous stage, and can now even sow 'coral seeds'. By physically touching a surface or object with his bare skin, the bladesman can plant a 'coral seed' at that location and, on command, cause a weapon to erupt outwards - though these seeds are still bound by the WP pool*. Only one seed can be sown at a time.As with any bladesman who has reached the peak of his style, he is now a terror on the battlefield. With the blade as his sickle, he reaps death to those around him, cutting a swathe through unworthy, unprepared, and untrained enemies. His strikes are heavy, and though they may not be particularly difficult to block, they are a pain to block because of the weight behind each and every blow. They have successfully transformed themselves from a typical ranged Ninjutsu specialist into a lethal hybrid of sniper and fighter, and many describe those who have reached the pinnacle of Hoshou no Buki to be like cannonballs, firing from a distance, charging into the throng, and mowing down everything in their path.*Essentially, when causing a seed to 'grow', they must have enough WP in their pool to be able to support it. If they've used up all 13 WP and sow a seed, the seed will grow into nothing. If they only have 1 spare WP, the seed could grow into the equivalent of a small caltrop, etc.	3				Rampant Coral Fertilization (requires all previous special techniques)At this point, the bladesman has become so attuned to the coral constructs that they are second nature to him. For every post the user makes in a thread, he gains a temporary bonus +1 WP to his pool. This surplus can only be used once - so if he charges an extra 6 WP and decides to make 3 coral wakizashi, he'll have 0 left in the pool. Once the weapons are broken, he'll start at 13 WP instead of 26.	20	0	24	0	0	0	35	33	31
900	1	1	Swordfish Humming	None	Ha. When the shinobi first begins, people expect swordplay to be weak, shoddy, and slow. That is the farthest thing from the truth. Even at the beginning stages, a shinobi knows very well how to treat his blade, keeping it as an extension of his body. The improvement comes with time, but even for now, the user knows how to block attacks and evade. While parrying might be out of the question, the user knows when to weave, when to step away, and when to block.Interesting to note, at this point, the user stays within his 'well,' usually, keeping his chakra enhanced area of effect well fed but not using much of the techniques garnished. While much of this style is purely defensive, the counter-attack capabilities are ferocious.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques: Double Bloody ReturnThe user, if skilled enough, can swing his sword against an opponent's weapon and using momentum and ninja skills, send the weapon on a return course, with the user's blade in town for a fun cross-action attack. The user has to be relatively fast in order for this to work and success is only guaranteed by the opponent.	Special Techniques: WellStat Requirements: Control 2, Reserves 2The user channels his chakra into an area roughly 4 meter in radius around him, cultivating the ground (or water, in which case, all limits are doubled) with his energy. This is now his 'well,' the area in which his special techniques may be used. As manipulating the well is difficult and best left to higher ranked ninja, users of this style are generally trained to keep their well area safe and not leave it, else they have to disestablish the connection and create a new well which takes one post, and an offensive action.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
900	2	2	Swordfish Humming	None	Fast, smooth, glittery. All these things define the user at this stage, for while the user isn't leaping around aerially like those other crazy acrobatic ninja, he knows how to guard his well and himself, returning the favor each time. While the user isn't very mobile, the sword is, twisting in insane directions to block and parry (as parrying finally comes into play). This style differs so incredibly from other sword styles as the focus is defensive and stationary, which almost seems stupid, yet the style remains utterly efficient.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques: RicochetAfter succesffuly blocking a sword, weapon, or other sharp object (gauntlet, perhaps?), the user relaxes their arm completely, allowing all the force combined to ricochet the sword in a complete arc to perform a secondary attack from the other side blocked. While the efficiency of the attack relies on the ninja in general, it is quite a bit of a surprise, a very useful in close combat, high-octane fighting.	Special Techniques: Swordfish HummingStat Requirements: Control 4, Reserves 4The Namesake jutsu from this style, Swordfish Humming draws a bit of water from the ground and sticks it to the blade. Simple? Not quite, complex chakra manipulates the water in ebbs and flows, sharpening the water's edge to razor like qualities. The water then spins around on the blade, creating a moving blade of sharp, tearing water. the swordfish has come out to play. This technique lasts indefinitely while the user is in his well.	8	6	0	0	0	0	0	6	0
900	3	3	Swordfish Humming	None	The user is at ease in his well now, capable of closing his eyes for some seconds in utter serenity while fighting. He can't see, or sense the blade, or anything of the sort, but the well has become a chakra 'nest' or sorts, and fighting in it is second-nature. The user is faster, more capable with a blade, but still limited depending on experience. A more experienced fighter is still more experienced, regardless.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques: Nullify and SlipUsing the focus of the humming aspect of the style, the blade targets another weapon, projectile, fist, etcetera, and nullifies the momentum (if the user has a higher stage of taijutsu, naturally), causing the weapon to pause for a second. The momentum is thusly transferred through the relaxed body, allowing the user, if he so wished to parry a second attack. With the momentum stopped, the user is capable of slipping through the guard, though unless the well is in effect, he has no chance of using any of the special aspects of the style.	Special Techniques: Spinning Sea-SawStat Requirements: Control 7, Reserves 7, Power 6Quite the nifty trick, if the user is in his well and happens to be any good with this style (read: all previous specials purchased), the user can perform quite the surprise by extending the razor edge of water around his blade an extra 3 meters. The extension is flexible, similar to a tense whip, that can still cut as well as any other sword. The serrated points also develop small hooks at their ends, so the water-whip extension can wrap around and cling to objects, allowing the user to pull back on something he's snared to saw it in one go. This technique can only be used when Swordfish Humming is activated, and at no point can the water-whip extend beyond the range of the user's Well.	11	9	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
900	4	4	Swordfish Humming	None	The advanced chuunin practitioner often plateaus at this stage, but that doesn't limit it's ferociousness. The defensive minded user can parry most odd angled attacks (not to mention demolish any bare-handed and unprotected attacks) and even dodge and weave their legs if need be to avoid low blows that might slip under their guard. Focused with their sword, but well aware of their body, this stage is dedicated to keeping themselves safe in any combat, meaning leg lifts, knee bends, and dips, ducks, and dodges are very common. The user still tries to keep in the well, though.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques: Swordfish FlailConsidered another defensive move, this technique is tricky to learn but incredibly useful. Worst case scenario is that the user gets hit, in the unlikely event the user is injured and sent flying, the skilled swordsman can rotate the blade to trace across the ground (or water surface, if they are so skilled), cutting at a near forty-five degree angle. The blade then cuts the ground, transferring the humming momentum through the swordfish and into the ground. Once enough inertia has transferred, the user can literally stop in mid-air, holding the blade sticking in the ground, which they can then recover and reform their well or go in for a simple bladed attack. Large rocks, however, won't be conducive to the technique, so make sure to be responsible.	Special Techniques: Rain JabStat Requirements: Control 10, Reserves 10, Power 8Aptly named, the technique uses the activated Spinning Sea-Saw to its fullest extent. By stabbing into the ground with his water-whip enhanced blade, the user can then command the whip to extend through the ground and up at any location within the Well. What makes this dangerous is that the extension actually branches out two meters in every direction (though if any branch protrudes outside the well, those branches dissipate into puddles of harmless water) as it erupts from the ground.	18	13	12	0	0	0	0	14	0
900	5	5	Swordfish Humming	None	The blade is now a perfect extension of the body, something that the user can use like an arm or a leg. The user stays still, usually, but the utter fluidity of the sword is to be envied by most. As Mist's longest standing sword style, this is why the style is so well-known: it's the perfect combination of intelligent defense and unprovoked, unsuspecting unleashed offensive capabilities. The user is fast, the sword is whipped around treats the air like a sea in which the swordfish weaves and twists. Perfection is near.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques: Humming Sword RainSimply put, this technique causes the sword to burst forth repeatedly in a flurry of stabs. Anywhere from 5-12 stabs are possible, but they are so fast that they are considered unison by most eyes. The are of damage is the size of a standard human torso, though the technique can be modified to hit a certain limb, though the accuracy would take a bit of a dive. The technique gains its name from the humming sound, a high pitched whirr that issues when the stabs commence. Opponent permission or death enabled thread is a must.	Special Techniques: HydroplaneStat Requirements: Control 15, Reserves 15, Power 13The most defensive technique in this style, Hydroplane requires Spinning Sea-Saw to be active. Whirling around, the user twirls the water-whip behind him like a ribbon, creating a tight defensive coil that can disperse most attacks along its sharp coil edges. While this cannot defend against Ninjutsu attacks, it is capable of defending against Physical attacks equal in Strength level (including bonuses) to the user's mastery of this style; after one post, the coil subsides and it reverts to its Spinning Sea-Saw form. The defensive coil can reflect the physical force exerted by an attack back upon its attacker to potentially stun them or throw them off balance by melding the attacking limb's momentum with the flow of the coil (whether it's clockwise or counter-clockwise), but its utility shines against projectile attacks. Projectiles can be carried with the flow and flung right back at the assailant, or thrown away, or even carried up to the top of the coil and thrown straight up into the air.	21	18	17	0	0	0	0	16	0
900	6	6	Swordfish Humming	None	The speed of the user has always been relatively high, and can be so fast that normal people can barely keep track, if they aren't so physically inclined. The user is now a blur when in motion... at least his arms. Though the lower half remains fairly stationary in combat (blocking and sometimes protecting from multiple directions) The only ninja truly capable of watching the user are taijutsu specialist of a high level, and doujutsu users that specifically give them the ability to see/predict movements. Though the user is under strain from combat, the relative ease of movement allows the blade extension to be the focus. Some liken the user to a medusa, a stationary root with a flurry of tentacles spinning around. Though a single blade, the ease and speed of the metal being whipped around is something to be feared.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques: HumConsidered one of the most fearsome techniques, Hum allows the user to spin his blade to gather kinetic energy. At the apex of momentum and inertia, the blade swings down, dull side (or flat side of blade if applicable) to hit the shoulder or arm of a target. In the event a shoulder or arm is hit, the kinetic force spirals through the body, fracturing bones in multiple places. While a user with tremendous resolve and willpower could fight through it, it is often a fight stopper. If the blade hits a person's head, the victim will likely suffer severe nausea, wooziness, or concussions.	Special Techniques: Revolving SwordfishStat Requirements: Control 19, Reserves 19, Power 18Quite simply put, the user, though tremendous chakra control can now shift their well with their body for a single post. Though it can only be used twice a thread, it often allows the user a much need strategic evasion (shifting spots) without losing their ability to manipulate the well.	27	25	23	0	0	0	0	19	17
900	7	7	Swordfish Humming	None	The user can now move at a speed that is so fast that afterimages are seen instead of the person, though this can only be used once per thread. The weapons are more than extensions of the body now. The blades are the body. The pure grace and skill within the user is so high that it can only be described as awe-inspiring. True mastery at this point, only few are ever seen with such strength.	2	5	2	Regular Techniques: CleaverUsing a single spin to gain energy, the user transfers his inertia into the blade and swings, slicing through an object (person, tree, door) with such ease that the two pieces remain intact. After a few seconds the force distributes with a high-pitched hum, causing the object to literally tear itself apart. A person would likely shred into pieces, a tree would splinter into sawdust, and a door would break down into small bits. Opponent permission is most definitely required.		35	34	30	0	0	0	0	24	20
899	1	1	Water of Deep Reflection	Sanshi no Mizu	The first stage is Futaiten, or Determination. As the most fundamental and simple of the seven forms of Sanshi no Mizu, the stage incorporates basic strikes and parries. The idea behind Futaiten is to cut off all options for an opponent, to be relentlessly dogged in your attacks, and to force the opponent to make a buckle under the pressure of this deceptively simple assault. There is no real subtlety behind Futaiten, only pure will and determination, hence the name of the form.	3	3	3			4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
899	2	2	Water of Deep Reflection	Sanshi no Mizu	The second form is Keisou, or Contention. The idea behind Keisou is to challenge another combatant man-to-man. Keisou is very much the dueler's weapon, specializing in fighting against a single opponent. The idea behind this stage is different from the blunt Futaiten, in that Contention requires fluid motions. Counter attacks are abundant within this form, with thrusts, parries, and quick, critical hits being the main focus. The user maneuvers around the opponent, always looking for an opening in the opponent's attack and take full advantage of it. Feints are commonly used to monopolize on this aspect of Keisou. However, this does not mean that Keisou is a defensive style, for it is a incredibly offensive, but in a very elegant and subtle matter.	3	3	3			6	8	0	0	0	6	0	0	0
899	3	3	Water of Deep Reflection	Sanshi no Mizu	The third stage is Kaifukuryoku, or Resilience. At times, the best offense is a good defense. This is the entire basis of the third part of Sanshi no Mizu. The user does nothing but block attacks, utilizing a very small amount of counter attacks. The idea behind this is to tire out the opponent, who is constantly throwing himself against the impenetrable wall of defense Kaifukuryoku carves out. There is much shifting of the body's position in relation to the field, for staying still is a poor defense for a swordsman. The minimal amount of dodging is used, always keeping oneself on the razor's edge between a hit and a miss. It also calls for a great deal amount of patience, for many times a chance for a counter-attack is given up to wait for the ultimate goal of one swift attack which ends the battle.	3	3	3			12	8	0	0	0	8	0	0	0
899	4	4	Water of Deep Reflection	Sanshi no Mizu	Sanshoku, or Aggression, is the fourth part of Sanshi no Mizu. Similar to Keisou, Sanshoku is a highly offensive part of the style. However, instead of taking Keisou's elegant approach, Sanshoku utilizes a wide variety of powerful attacks and gymnastic feats to defeat the enemy. Swift and strong swings of the sword are emphasized greatly, as well as attacking from as many different directions possible. Back flips, bouncing off walls, somersaults, and even attacking while walking on walls is encouraged for it can be confusing and disorienting to the enemy. Utilizing momentum by swinging around to dish out more powerful attacks is a common aspect of Sanshoku.	3	3	3			15	15	13	0	0	14	0	0	0
899	5	5	Water of Deep Reflection	Sanshi no Mizu	The fifth portion is Shitsuyou, or Perseverance. Kaifukuryoku and Sanshoku both have aspects within Shitsuyou. The first part is the defense which Shitsuyou employs, which resembles the defense Kaifukuryoku uses. However, there is a key difference, in that any and all counter attacks are taken and in many cases, attacks are made even when there is no counter available. The user of Shitsuyou blocks and dodges all attacks and gives back as viciously and powerfully as they would in Sanshoku. Strength and stamina is a key part to this ability, for it uses two different aspects in a combination style that can confuse, overwhelm, and utterly defeat an opponent.	3	3	3			19	19	18	0	0	16	0	0	0
899	6	6	Water of Deep Reflection	Sanshi no Mizu	Sessei is the Moderation part of the style. Sessei emphasizes balance in all things, from attack to defense to movement to the state of mind. It is not the best style but also not the worst. To best describe Sessei is to compare the user to someone who flows along with the world, not truly being a part of it. Those who fight against Sessei find themselves to be guided along, almost as if their fight were a neverending dance. It is an excellent form for training and meditation, but not the wisest choice for battle. However, in the right hands, Sessei can be used to guide opponent into battle and, ultimately, their doom.	3	3	3			25	25	25	0	18	18	0	0	0
899	7	7	Water of Deep Reflection	Sanshi no Mizu	Kyoukan is the final part of the Sanshi no Mizu style, also called Ferocity. It is quite possibly the most directly offensive style out of all the seven parts of Sanshi no Mizu, even more so then Sanshoku, Keisou, or Futaiten. Large, deliberate motions combined with heavy unrhythmic attacks allow for powerful, yet completely unpredictable offensive movements. The sword is in constant motion, and yet never in the same place as it was before. It is a highly disciplined style, for there cannot be a single moment of hesitation or repetition. All aspects of Kyoukan are random to the opponent, and yet completely in the control of the user. This paradox is the strength of the style. While it may seem as if there are many wide openings in Kyoukan, this is in fact not true at all, for the user of Kyoukan uses the aspect of guidance of Sessei in its elaborate dance, completely in control of all movements. It is the ultimate peak of technical skill, and only one disciplined fully in mind and body can even make an attempt to use Kyoukan.	3	3	3			33	33	33	0	22	22	0	0	0

898	2	2	Jaws of Death	Koketsu Kenbu		5	2	2		Same Geigeki (Shark Ambush Attack)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 4, Tactics 4Description: The user concentrates his chakra into the sword and slashes down, hitting the ground and stirring up particles of dust, grass, and dirt. It rises up in a murky cloud shaped like the head of a shark, jaws open and flying towards the enemy. The shinobi hides behind this cloud and uses it to confuse his opponent or make him hesitate. Once close enough, the swordsman is able to execute an attack that has a much higher chance of success. If done on top of water, a cloud of mist is formed instead.	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
898	3	3	Jaws of Death	Koketsu Kenbu		5	2	2		Sameha no Batsu (Sharktoothed Strike)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 7, Tactics 7, Intelligence 6Description: Using chakra, water is gathered on the edge of the blade in small triangular shapes so that the cutting edge now resembles a row of teeth. When attacking, the user is able to dish out sawing damage, not just slicing damage, and if he scores a direct hit, the water teeth will actually break off and remain in the enemy's body for one more post before dripping away. New water teeth automatically replace the gaps after each slash. This technique may be maintained for up to 4 posts.Special: Once Power and Control stats reach 10, the user may perform this without a water source.	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
898	4	4	Jaws of Death	Koketsu Kenbu		5	2	2		Fukahire (Shark Fin)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 10, Tactics 10, Intelligence 8Description: A two-part technique, performed on top of water. When the user swings, the tip of the blade pierces the top of the water. Using chakra as a magnet, droplets of water follow and attach to the non-cutting side of the blade, forming a thin film of water with sharp edges that fan out in a triangle. It looks as though a watery shark fin is sitting on the sword's back. When the user swings again, the fin can be launched at the opponent like a big shuriken. Enough water gathers on the sword to launch 2 water fuma shuriken in succession.Samegawa (Sharkskin)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 10, Tactics 10, Intelligence 8Description: Performed on top of water. When attacking, the user swings his sword from the surface of the water up, sending a spray of droplets into the air. At the same time, a blade of water rises and flies towards the target, skimming the surface. When the blade connects, it explodes and releases "water shrapnel," sharp and jagged chunks of water held together with chakra, lightly shredding the injured area as if the victim had his clothing/skin rubbed across sharkskin the wrong way.Special: At Strength 24, the user is able to perform Samegawa underwater with the same effects.	18	14	11	0	14	0	0	0	0
898	5	5	Jaws of Death	Koketsu Kenbu		5	2	2		Karifuka (Hunting Shark)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 15, Tactics 15, Intelligence 13Description: Employed only when the shinobi is fighting underwater. This technique allows him to move his attacking arm and swing his sword through water as if the water offered as much resistance as air. In other words, he can fight at normal speed when attacking with his blade. The attacker can do this up to 6 times in a single thread. Once per thread, the attacker can ignore all water resistance around their body.Same Nami (Shark Wave)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 15, Tactics 15, Intelligence 13Description: Performed on top of water. The user releases chakra from the sword as he swings down in a diagonal cut, then again in a cut perpendicular to the first slash. As the 'X' flies towards the target, the chakra picks up water, resulting in what looks like a shark's head. Attack deals both cutting and blunt damage. The Same is 5 feet in height and no more than 5 feet wide.	24	18	14	0	16	0	0	0	0
898	6	6	Jaws of Death	Koketsu Kenbu		5	2	2		Shumokuzame Kyuushuu (Hammerhead Shark Assault)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 19, Tactics 19, Intelligence 18Description: Similar to Same Nami, except that the 'X' takes the form of a hammerhead shark's head, flat horizontally and is much larger than the original Same. As the attack travels towards the opponent, the shinobi hides behind it and then, just as the head connects with the enemy for blunt damage, the user slashes through the rest of the water from the back of the head for a surprise attack.Sesshoku Same (Feeding Shark)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 19, Tactics 19, Intelligence 18Description: Performed from underwater, and usually employed during an ambush. The user swings his sword twice to create an 'X', aiming the attack towards the surface of the water. As the attack travels, it takes on the shape of a shark's full body, and upon connecting with the target, explodes, knocking the opponent away. The user can also force the water shark to detonate, sending a blast of harsh water in all directions with enough power to knock someone off their feet. The water's force is comparable to the force of the water from a fire department's heavy duty water hose. To detonate the shark, the user simply takes. his open palm, lines it up with the Same and then closes his hand into a fist.	30	25	20	0	18	18	0	0	0
898	7	7	Jaws of Death	Koketsu Kenbu		5	2	2		Koketsu no Same (Shark Jaws of Death)Special Stat Requirements: Willpower 26, Tactics 25, Intelligence 24Description: The technique from which the sword style's name is derived, performed from underwater. The user begins to spin quickly in the water, then slices upwards in an arc, releasing chakra. The chakra gathers water around it in the shape of an enormous shark head as it approaches the target. This time, the shark's jaws open, and when it breaks the surface of the water, the victim is in the center of the open mouth, and the teeth snap shut. So strong is the force of this technique that it has been known to crunch a man in half.	37	33	29	0	22	22	0	0	0
897	1	1	Forgetful Palm 	Wasureppoi Hirate	* Target - None at this point. The style teaches defensive measures first.* Aim - Let the attacker physically come to you first. Working on the timing of leg sweeps and arm grabs are the focus now. At this stage, only basic redirection of force is possible. An opponent can not be thrown in a grab only guided out of the path of the Boukyaku.* Water - Before he can even begin to direct the flow of the Sanzu water, the shinobi must focus on the previous aspect. It is impossible to work on the water aspect of the style at this level.* Flow - The water runs about the strength of a leaky sink faucet.* Suiton - The shinobi can perform up to stage one Mist ninjutsu using Sanzu water as a source, once per thread.	5	4		Iwashimizu (Water Trickling from Rocks)Description: The user swings his leg up and stomps the ground. The Sanzu water flowing from the ankle follows the leg's path and acts as a watery shield in front of his body, causing any enemy who rushes in to touch it and lose a split second of memory.		5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
897	2	2	Forgetful Palm 	Wasureppoi Hirate	* Target - Now, the user is not so much concerned with getting a strike in as figuring out where he wants it to land. At this level, he begins to see the body in regions: upper region (head and chest), mid region (abdominal and stomach), lower region (lower intestines to pelvis area), and limbs* Aim - This stage focuses on those points in arms and legs, and most easily available when doing a redirection from the grabs and sweeps.* Water - Still has not improved. At this point, the Boukyaku is pretty much letting his Sanzu water fall wherever it does naturally, without any care from him.* Flow - The water runs at about the strength of a running sink faucet.* Suiton - The shinobi can perform up to stage two Mist ninjutsu using Sanzu water as a source, once per thread	5	4		Kappa (Water Demon)Description: A simple but useful tactic, especially for novice Boukyaku fighters, this move requires the opponent to be attacking the user hand-to-hand. By blocking an attack such as a punch or a kick with the arms, palms facing outward, the user then tries to grab the offending limb. While the Sanzu water momentarily throws the enemy off-focus, the Boukyaku pulls him in for a counter-attack.Cavity Point: GaishohoLocated one half inch above above the Pericardium meridian, on the palm side of the arm about two and a half inches above the wrist, between the Radius and the ulna bones. The user will try to perform a two handed strike in to the soft tissue with their free hand while performing an arm grab. It is used for limb destruction which will paralyze or numb the arm for a short time.Cavity Point: FukutoThe Fukuto cavity is located on the midline of the lateral aspect of the thigh. When performing a high leg sweep, the Boukyaku will aim to strike the point using their tibia. If successful, this will cause the muscle in the thigh to convulse, resulting in the loss of motor function in that leg.		8	6	0	0	0	0	6	0	0
897	3	3	Forgetful Palm 	Wasureppoi Hirate	*Target - Now that they have begun to see the body in divisions, the target becomes the upper region which is still widely available in redirection and the head and throat in frontal attacks.*Aim - Has not changed from the previous level.*Water - Since the Boukyaku is now more comfortable with his style, he begins to pay attention to where the Sanzu water lands when he moves his palms and feet. Though unable to do much with this knowledge, it is an important step for the trainee to master.*Flow - The water now runs at about the force of water hose on low.*Suiton - The shinobi can perform up to stage three Mist ninjutsu using Sanzu water as a source, twice per thread	5	4		Kousui (Hard Water)Description: The Boukyaku thrusts into the chest region of the opponent with both palms, knocking him windless. The disorientation ability of Sanzu water is doubly effective when the victim is unable to remember why he can't draw breath.Cavity Point: HichuThis pressure point is located in the center of the lowest part of the Neck, in the hollow. Using a double finger blow, will try to strike in a straight forward or in an upward curve. This suppresses the windpipe, causing shallow breath of the opponent. Besides the initial stun, this makes breathing difficult and hampers anything physically straining.Cavity Point: MimiSimply the ears. With their wrists, or fists, the Boukyaku will attempt to slam both hands on either side of their opponent's head. This will rupture of the tympanic membrane (ear drum). This will result in a lack of hearing and uncoordination, with vertigo following after a sucessful strike.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 7, Control 7, Reserves 6*Kinen Mizutamari (Memory Puddle)Description: Allows the user to use their Sanzu water to cover the field in four small puddles of it, about three feet in diameter. If a target steps into one of these puddles, they (for the duration that they are in the puddle) forget what their past action they had just taken. An opponent may be forced in to a puddle, but the duration is only for one combat post. They'll forget how they got in the area to begin with and thus, chain attacks, or ninjutsu that takes so long to prepare for can not be performed.	11	9	0	0	0	0	8	0	0
897	4	4	Forgetful Palm 	Wasureppoi Hirate	*Target - The focus still remains in the upper region.*Aim - His insight in close combat has also improved, and now the user is able to pinpoint parts of the body in the middle of his chain sequences as specific as the lower arm, the chest, arms, and legs etc.*Water - With knowledge learned at the previous level, the clan member is now able to adjust the position of his hands and feet right before he strikes, so that the attacking limb's motion causes his Sanzu water flow to rise up and make contact with his target a split second before the actual hand or foot does, thus initiating the memory-leech a little earlier.*Flow - Now the water is running about a water hose about to burst from pressure.*Suiton - The shinobi can perform up to stage for Mist ninjutsu using Sanzu water as a source, twice per thread.	5	4		Suisha (Water Wheel)escription: The user must be above the target in some way. As he descends, he attacks with a rotating heel drop, directing the water from his ankle down at his enemy before the physical kick connects.Cavity Point: TendoThis is generally used in conjunction with the above technique,hitting the Tendo, which is located on the top of the head, with the heel of the foot. With a lighter strike, dizziness will occur. A heavier strike may cause severe shock to the cerebrum, resulting in irritation of nerves causing mental and bodily senses to fail, resulting in loss of motor function.Cavity Point: YakoThe location of Yako is mostly defensive, since the opponent would have to be open for an attack. It is four inches above the medial epicedial of the femur, between m. vastus medialis and m. Sartorius. One inch below the center of the inner thigh. It causes pain of the lumbosacral region, pain of the lower abdominal, and severe cramping of the stomach and intestines.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 10, Control 10, Reserves 8*Kinen Fi-rudo (Memory Field)Description: When an opponent is struck and his instant of memory sapped, the memories are stored in the little droplets of Sanzu water left behind on the hands of the Boukyaku after each strike. Thus, by controlling one's hands and feet, vibrating them tremendously, the user can actually create a thin water mist field of these little memory droplets that, when targeted around the opponent, has them relive the attack combo they just were assaulted with all over again in their mind. For him or her, it is like it is happening all over again.Furthermore, because the water droplets containing the memory of each strike are scattered in the mist, the opponent relives the combo in an out-of-order sequence, so it is like experiencing a whole new combo (even though they wouldn't remember the first one). Finally, the more combos performed before this attack is used, the more droplets that can be collected for the 'memory field', and the longer the new out-of-order sequence the target mentally experiences continues. This jutsu is often set up between Forgetful Palm combo sequences to leave them open for the next combo. The memory Sanzu water mist field doesn't have to be used on the target the memories were stolen from. It can be used on another opponent, and they will experience the out-of-order memory Forgetful Palm combo sequence in their minds as if it happened to them.This jutsu must be performed after an attack using Wasureppoi Hirate, otherwise the Sanzu water that contains memories of being struck will fall to the ground and evaporate. The mist field itself is about ten feet wide and lasts two posts.	17	15	11	0	0	0	14	0	0
897	5	5	Forgetful Palm 	Wasureppoi Hirate	*Target - The target areas are slowly shifting focus to lower regions. *Aim - Aim itself is not changed, only that the speed at which the user is able to process, in his mind, where he wants to hit has improved so that he strikes the desired place every time, barring blocks from the target.*Water - With the proper flicking motion of the wrist, the Boukyaku is able to control his Sanzu water in a way that, to an outsider, seems as though the flow of water is a flowing cloth ribbon. With palm attacks, he is able to make the water stretch out and make contact with the enemy even while there are still a few inches separating him and the other person, sapping his memory of that instant of touch, and then sapping it a second time when the user's actual hand makes contact. He is unable to manage this with his feet, however.*Flow - The water runs at a force of a bathtub faucet on low*Suiton - The shinobi can perform up to stage five Mist ninjutsu using Sanzu water as a source, three times per thread.	5	4		Regular Techniques:Cavity Point: KintekiRegardless of male or female, this cavity point exists in the pubic bone. The Boukyaku will kick in an upward angle causing irritation of surrounding nerves, arteries and veins, with the possible loss of bladder retention. It makes movement unviable, and causes shortness of breath for the remainder of the attack. Then the pain in the area and upper legs is caused to hamper movement after a successful hit. Occasionally, if used with enough force, it can knock the opponent out (opponent permission).Cavity Point: BiteiThe tiny indention located just above the tail bone. A two finger strike in to the indention or a correctly placed heel kick. The lucky thing with the Bitei being hit is it's proximity to the acupoint Chang Qian. Loss of function in lower limbs will occur, however major pain is induced with further movement.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 15, Control 15, Reserves 13*Mishiri Kakikesu (Recognition Erase)Description: This is a specialized attack with the palms or feet that blocks the target's memory of all the faces he has been storing in his brain since birth. After being struck, he will be unable to recognize the faces of his teammates, his enemies, his friends and family, even his own face. In addition, he loses recollection of various Hidden Village insignias or clan symbols. Fortunately, the effect wears off after a about half an hour (four posts), but this technique can cripple team efforts by making it so that the cell members do not remember who their comrades and opponents are.Kinen Se (Memory Torrent)Description: One of the scariest powers of the Boukyaku clan. This is essentially the Boukyaku equivalent of a Chidori/Rasengan type move, a concentrated ball of Sanzu water focused into a small, compact area (by forcing Sanzu water out of the wrists and ankles) with essentially the firepower of a miniature-torrential tidal wave and unleashes it on the enemy. Such a direct blast of an extreme dousing of Sanzu water will not only do a fair amount of damage to the user on impact and knock them down, but they will be sapped of all memory of the fight taking place in front of them. They are still capable of fighting, but they will lose the memory of what took place that day. This is limited to one use per thread.	22	19	15	0	0	0	16	0	0
897	6	6	Forgetful Palm 	Wasureppoi Hirate	*Target - Remains in lower to mid sections.*Aim - The size of a target region the Boukyaku is able to strike at has again shrunk, to where he can pinpoint areas as big as two inches in diameter even in the middle of heavy combat.*Water - The same fighting ability he was capable of with his palm strikes has improved to where he can manage it with his feet, too. His familiarity with how and where the Sanzu water flows when he attacks has heightened to where the water can hit an opponent a full hand's width before the actual palm or foot makes contact, again stealing that instant of memory twice in a single attack.*Flow - The water runs at a force of a bathtub faucet on low*Suiton - The shinobi can perform up to stage five Mist ninjutsu using Sanzu water as a source, four times per thread.	5	4		Regular Techniques:Cavity Point: Super Chi PointThe location of the super chi point has been widely discussed, however the main consensus is that it is located in the center of the umbilicus or the belly button. The Boukyaku must land a hit in a perfectly straight angle causing complete debilitation. Internal organs are damaged, and bleeding may occur.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 19, Control 19, Reserves 18*Roppyaku Rokujyu Roku Kisei no Mai (Dance of Six-hundred Sixty-six Deaths)Description: Using a great deal of concentration, the shinobi collects water in his hands when he attacks with open palms. As the first strike connects and saps from the target the memory of being hit, the Boukyaku actually retains those drops of Sanzu water so that when he strikes with the same hand again, the enemy will have the memory of being struck the last time returned to him, while suffering from an actual strike. Again, the Boukyaku retains the drops of Sanzu water that sapped his opponent's memory, and hits him again; the target's memory will receive memory of being hit twice as much and twice as hard. And when struck again, his mind tells him he was hit four times as much and four times as hard. And on and on the technique goes, each time the memory of pain rising ever higher.The victim is not really hit six-hundred sixty-six times, the real number is closer to about twenty, as even a Boukyaku can retain only so much Sanzu water in his palms. But the poor target, by the time the full technique is finished, will be in the greatest amount of pain one can be and not lose consciousness. From having memories of being struck returned again and again to his mind, he will feel as if he were hit six-hundred sixty-six times. His body has sustained the normal amount of damage it would take from the Boukyaku (strength of the blows is not increased) but his mind will remember the purely agonizing pain for the rest of his life. This takes place over three posts as they go through each cavity point.*Jigoku ni Shibarareta (Bound to Hell)Description: There is a reason that the Boykyaku cherish their bandages so much. The ultimate and most fearsome power of the Boukyaku's direct link of their wrists and ankles into the waters of the Sanzu River in hell are held back by those bandages. The bandages, which are normally unwound only a short bit, fully unwrap, save for one loop just above their point of origin. The bandages can stretch far enough to grab within a ten-foot radius of the Boukyaku for up to three posts. However, the user must be standing in place to properly control the bandages.	29	26	20	0	0	0	18	18	0
897	7	7	Forgetful Palm 	Wasureppoi Hirate	*Aim - His insight in the middle of combat has risen to such inhuman extent that, if he so wishes, the clan member is able to target specific finger bones or toes.*Water - The Boukyaku and his Sanzu water move as two separate entities at this final level. While he strikes at one place, the water making contact before his actual body, he moves his next attacking limb so that the water flowing from it strikes another place almost simultaneously, again followed by the actual palm or foot.*Flow - The water runs at a force of a rippling stream.*Suiton - The shinobi can perform up to stage five Mist ninjutsu using Sanzu water as a source, five times per thread.	5	4			Special Techniques Requirement: Power 26, Control 25, Reserves 24*Utsuro (Hollow)Description: A truly terrifying technique of the Boukyaku. This is a special kind of attack in which the Sanzu water actually pulls out a cherished memory of the person struck. This may be the memory of his academy graduation, of a dear deceased friend, of his wedding. The memory extracted is completely random (in other words, up to the target), permanently stored inside the Sanzu water until it hits the ground and evaporates, taking that precious memory along with it.*Sanzu no Denryu (Currents of the Sanzu)Prerequisites: Jigoku ni Shibarareta (Bound to Hell)Description: An advanced version of Jigoku ni Shibarareta, works in essentially the same way except the Boukyaku can move and fight normally while the person is being held. Now with the ability to send streams of Sanzu water toward their prey, a memory of a jutsu may be erased if they are held for the entire four post duration. However, the pain from tapping into this higher form clan technique will be so great that, if the Boukyaku tries to use it again he will pass out from the sheer agony and permanently forget the first form of Jigoku ni Shibarareta (in other words, it needs to be re-learned). Because it is the Sanzu water flowing from through the bandages, for the duration that the technique is in use, there is no water flow to the Boukyaku's palm and feet surfaces for memory stealing abilities in other attacks.	37	35	27	0	0	0	22	22	0
896	1	1	In The Name of the Father	Otousan no Namae Ni	Tranquil Pond - The user is still not very capable at what he does, and his 'oh so valiant' slaps at oncoming blows can only be called blocking if you're nice (and the parent of the student. Otherwise it looks like a kindergarteners attempt at brawling)Raging Rapids - So the user knows how to use a knife - good for him! Just don't stab yourself in the eye with that sharp, pointy weapon son! Jokes aside, the user is taught much of the basics of fighting with a knife.Deceiving Depths - The traps at this stage are not exactly lethal or even damaging. Be happy if you reach the level of 'minor annoyance'. They're not that subtle either.	2	5	2	Redirect the CurrentAlright, so maybe I was a bit harsh in the initial description there. By 'slapping at oncoming blows' as I said, the user learns how to divert oncoming blows so that they pass ther user harmlessly. Since it only requires getting the timing down the user can often redirect blows of much greater strength than he would be capable of blocking.The First StepLike I said, be happy if you reach the level of minor annoyance. By tying a piece of strings between two objects, the thin string will most likely not be seen though hiding it in high grass for example would be advised. [Requires Strings]		2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
896	2	2	In The Name of the Father	Otousan no Namae Ni	Tranquil Pond - Great, the user is slowly getting the hang of applying a focused amount of strength at the precise right moment to avert oncoming blows.Raging Rapids - Ambidexterity is the name of the game! The user must be taught to wield the knives in both hands with the same level of skill. Their attack pattern has now become much more varied, mixing stabbing and cutting attacks at vital points. They also learn how to effectively deflect oncoming blows with the knives, as well as combining them with their other skills.Deceiving Depths - The traps are slowly becoming more deceptive and most of all useful. They are still not exactly harmful, but still effective if used correctly. If the foe is not in a hurry and study the ground, they'll probably see hints of the trap.	2	5	2	Damming the CurrentAt this stage the user has become accustomed at averting attacks, so now we are going to put that skill into even more use. By increasing the force, the blow is parried even further from the user. That is not all however, as the user also steps in as the blow is about to be diverted and moves his bodywheight behind one of the opponents leg, most likely sending them stumbling forward, off-balance.Swirling RapidsThe user parries a blow and using the guard of the knife he forces it downward to the ground or high up into the air. They then spin around and step into the opponent's guard in the same motion, following the deflecting movement and use their other knife to slash/stab at the foe's vitals.'I'm a little tied up at the moment'A classic trap which all hunters seems to be born with the knowledge of how to make them. The basic trap is a noose, hidden of course, and once the trap is triggered the noose constricts around a foot or similar and then bring the quarry up into the air once the tension of the string is release. At chuunin or jounin level the basic noose is often replaced by a net, or a noose made of razor wire. [Requires strings/rope and for the more advanced version, a net]		5	9	0	0	0	0	0	6	0
896	3	3	In The Name of the Father	Otousan no Namae Ni	Tranquil Pond - At this level the user is finally learning how to use the opponents own strength and momentum against them. With that, the user takes another huge step in the threat he is to his foe.Raging Rapids - The knives of the Tanshin clan are special, yet it is at this stage where they make use of their full potential. While they are not meant to travel great distances, their balance and ability makes them excellent weapons to cover those quite dangerous mid-range combat situations.Deceiving Depths - We're becoming sneaky now are we? Think that we're the bloody greatest trapmaster the world has ever seen? Look, just because your trap can actually hurt someone worse than a bruised knee (and a broken neck, in case someone fell from the above mentioned trap and landed on their head. But that's just silly), don't wet yourself just yet. The traps are hidden carefully, mostly in bushes or in trees. The signs are still there but if they are failed to be noticed, the only warning the opponent will get is the soft thud as they release their deadly ammunition.	2	5	2	Up and awayMomentum is, as far as you are concerned, everything. With the correct amount of momentum, the correct amount of speed and of course the correct amount of timing, great feats can be accomplished.By first averting the blow and apply enough pressure at the correct spot to throw them off balance, the user then either help their confused opponent by using his own strength and grab them, or just places himself in the correct way to make them fall. The result is often the opponent landing heavily (while not always on their head) on the ground. Add knife stab here?Drops of the rainThe Tanshin throws one of the knives with quite awesome accuracy as long as it is within 5 meters. They can recall the knives and use them again in the same post as long as it has not travelled more than 5 meters.Scrap O'launcherPeople are not really that fond of having sharp, pointy objects fired at them. Using this odd fear, the Tanshin knows how to build a simple catapult with the use of strings, which can fire a dozen small projectiles (kunai/shuriken size). Genin can create one catapult, Chuunin two and Jounin three. [Requires strings and projectiles of choice]		7	13	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
896	4	4	In The Name of the Father	Otousan no Namae Ni	Tranquil Pond - The Tanshin have now fully mastered the basics of using momentum and correct timing. Now with the help of those skills, they can perform really nasty stuff. Through knowledge of the human bonestructure, they also know where to apply the correct amount of pressure to make them snap.Raging Rapids - The agility and dexterity of the knives have increase greatly at this stage. With quick motions the Tanshin takes advantage of their increased defensive capabilities and counters, often with devestating result. They can now throw both knives and recall them back and use them again in the same post, as long as they have not travelled more than 7 meters. They are also quite capable of blocking projectiles with the knifes alone.Deceiving Depths - Alright, I'll admit you're not half that bad. At this level you really are a nasty bugger and the mere knowledge of your presence will ensure that most enemies will walk cautiously around you. But that might not be enough, as the traps are well-hidden at this stage and only a cautious observer will see the hints of it. The only thing that reveals their presence otherwise is the faint feeling of floating in mid-air as they fall into the pit. May their corpse adorn it forever.	2	5	2	Swan songAn arm is basically required for this technique. Grabbing hold of the opponents arm, the Tanshin twist it around behind their back. At this moment of the technique, a light twitch of the user's arm could snap his arm out of place. Thus the target is kept calm, or rather forced to do so. A knife placed at the opponent's throat might also be a good idea. You know, remind him of the benefits of being alive. [Requires Opponent's Permission]Cutting WhirlpoolA technique which uses the same principle as 'The Enveloping Tide'. 'Enveloping' the attack they move their blade towards the base of the opponent's weapon. Because when you attack someone with a weapon, your wrist is often left unprotected. Aiming for this opening, the user deflects the attack away from themselves once enough force has been wasted and with a flick of their wrist attempts to cut open the wrist. At the same time they send the other knife flying towards another vital point, using both attacks as potential decoys for the other.The Second Step (and the first fall)Simple yet effective, that's the name of the game. In its essence this trap is simply a hole in the ground: most commonly a very deep and wide hole most of the time, a hole which is concealed from sight. It is a pit whose bottom is usually riddled with sharp, pointy things (commonly poisoned) that will make life miserable. Seeing as shinobi are very light-footed, do not think that this trap is rendered useless. That which conceals the hole is either built that the exact amount of tension must be placed on it, or it uses a exploding tag to set it off.[Requires: Exploding tag if you want it to be the trigger. Poison if you want the stakes to be such]	Assassin's Mist[Requires Lone Figure in the Mist]This technique seeks to take advantage of the deadly Tanshin mist to ensure a quick kill. With Lone Figure in the Mist active, the Tanshin darts in with his knives out, camouflaged by the mist. When the shinobi is within 3 meters of the victim, he thickens and manipulates the mist to manifest 3 other shadowy figures, so that the victim sees 4 identical attackers rushing in from each of the cardinal directions, and has great difficulty discerning which is the real Tanshin. All four figures strike in the same instant with both their knives, although because the mist figures created are not true physical bunshin, the victim only suffers one attack. Nevertheless, the opening this technique creates often allows a decisive strike that may help end a fight quickly. Because of the exertion and difficulty of creating and manipulating the figures, this technique causes the Tanshin's mist to dissolve afterwards, regardless of its normal duration. The technique also has a 3-post cooldown.	12	22	9	0	0	0	0	14	0
896	5	5	In The Name of the Father	Otousan no Namae Ni	Tranquil Pond - There is a reason why those who have fought the Tanshin up close are hesitant to attack. Once a member of the clan have reached this level of skills, things start to go snap, crack and most certainly 'Ouch', even if very little strength is involved. [Keep in mind that actual grabbing ahold of the opponent requires their permission]Raging Rapids - The Tanshin must learn to be aware of his surroundings and how to cope with it. At this stage they can throw their knives at one target and then, in the same motion attack another with the very knives he threw only moments ago. Their thrown attacks are carried out with enough skill and force to pierce a tree trunk and pass through on the other side.Deceiving Depths - Tread carefully my enemy. No matter how hard you try you will never be able to foresee your evident doom. It is hidden. Yes, it is hidden well. While the user's smell is not yet masked, the signs are there if one were to look carefully. Even the sound of them being triggered is muffled (yet still there).	2	5	2	Descending TidalwaveYou first draw them into the tide, envelop them, then watch them as they get mercilessy crushed by the descending wave. Having dispersed the attack, you move your one arm around their arm while you move to the side of the arm which attacked you. Use their own shoulder as you move yours under theirs and using your momentum, your own strength and the position of their shoulder, you move upward. This is the part where things go 'snap' and 'ouch'. [Requires Opponent's Permission]Drizzling rainThe first knife goes toward the feet of the target, sending them stumbling forward. The other goes toward their knee, to make them lose balance completely. All that is left is for the user to move forward and finish them off.Tree hugThe trap is not so much about hugging a tree as it is about a tree trying to hug you. If you consider being crushed to tiny, tiny bits a hug. I sure do.The said trees are often tied to in mid-air, often held back until triggered where they will descend upon your foe in a massive rush of pointy and crunchy death. Sharpened sticks are not an uncommon accessory to these trunks. Often done in pairs, where the first one will probably be detected, but the second one won't. [Requires: Poison, if you like to poison the sharpened sticks]	WaterfallThe Tanshin are shinobi of Kirigakure no Sato. Manipulating water in all its differnet forms comes as naturally to them as breathing. The knife is charged with their chakra (or rather, more than usual) and once it is thrown the effects immediately becomes apparant. As the knife sails through the air, copies made from the very moisture in the air itself forms beside it. A total of 10 copies are made for the first knife that is thrown, while a total of 5 copies are made from the second knife. [Requires Mizu Soujuu/Jouki Soujuu]	15	30	11	0	0	0	0	16	0
896	6	6	In The Name of the Father	Otousan no Namae Ni	Tranquil Pond - At this stage, bones are being broken from the left to the right. All that is needed is an outstretched arm or leg, a unprotected neck and the Tanshin is game. Their movement is fluid as they flow into the opponent's guard and destroy it from within.Raging Rapids - The user is now proficient and sure enough of his recall skills that he can actually aim for three different targets before initiating in close combat. His aim is surely, while not achieving pin-point accuracy, superb within 15 meters or so. The user's stabbing attacks are not to be underestimated either, as they can most surely pierce even the thickest breastplate.Deceiving Depths - Unless your opponent is a psychic, very lucky or both he will probably not spot the trap until it is about to bite him in the ass. There is very little traces of human intrusion in that area of Mother Nature unless the user wants it to be, nor is there any smell surrounding it. A residue of the user's chakra might still linger on in the place though.	2	5	2	Unrelenting wavesThe human bone structure is a funny thing. It can withstand tremendous amounts of pressure on certain spots, yet on others they can hardly stand a single punch from a normal (non-shinobi) man. Elbows, kneecaps or similar joints are favorable targets.The user does in fact not even have to grab hold of the target. All he needs to do is to apply enough pressure on two points, and with enough chakra, momentum or raw strength, destroy them utterly.Infernal StormA trap that is as devilish and inhumane as its name implies. Once triggered, the trap releases several small pouches, filled with miniature explosive tags. These open up and spread their devastating cargo scattering around the target. Add fire and the ensuing explosion could most certainly take out a building. [Requires exploding tags]	Chrushing TsunamiThe Tanshin are more than well-versed in the human bone strukture. They know its weak spot, each joint that could be broken with the slightest force. At this level of skils however, they can literally feel the smallest stress in a bone just by touching their foe and once they have found it, they force a huge amount of chakra into that crack. Essentially, the Tanshin's attack is greatly enhanced by their chakra.	22	36	17	0	0	0	0	22	0
896	7	7	In The Name of the Father	Otousan no Namae Ni	Tranquil Pond - You don't want to see someone who managed to face a Tanshin and still live to tell the tale. Mostly because he'll only be able to communicate by flashing his eyelids, since the rest of the bones in his body will either be shattered, broken or just pointless. The user is a ghost of movement and once you see him, it's too late.Raging Rapids - The user's aim is strong and true, his throws can pierce even the thickest armour and he could probably cut through solid stone if he attempted to do so. They can throw the knives at four different targets before initiating in close combat, with a maximum range of 20 meters.Deceiving Depths - If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? If that is not true, the traps don't exist in this world until they are triggered to spell the doom for your opponent. The traps are impossible to see, impossible to smell, impossible to hear. Yes, they're that awesome.	2	5	2	Trap MasteryThe sign of a true master is their ability to think outside the box. At this stage, the Tanshin can freely combine traps to ensure their opponents demise [The amount of traps that can be combined depends on the stages of the traps. The added up stages of all traps can not exceed 7. Ie one can combine a stage 5 trap with a stage 2, or a stage 4 with a stage 3 and a stage 1]	Astral Tanshin BodyThe techniques signifies the mastery of not only the Tanshin taijutsu but the Tanshin style of ninjutsu as well. It begins by the user throwing a knife at the target and the moment that knife leave their hand; they become a transluctant yellowy-white ghost of themselves. While in this form they make no sound, have no smell nor can they be touched or touch physical objects.However, the moment they touch the Tanshin knife again they phase back into existence so to say. The most common case being that the knife have hit their opponent, they will phase back into existence only to cut them open from point blank range.Whilst 'phased out' they can not recall the knife. They will remain in astral form until they either touch the knife or the maximum duration of 3 posts as expired. After they have phased back into existence, there is one post cooldown before they can use it again. [Can be used at most twice/thread]	32	40	27	0	0	0	0	24	0
895	1	1	Solid Atmosphere	Ganjou Taiki	As with all beginners of Taijutsu, the student new to Ganjou Taiki is quite incompetent with its mechanics. With years upon years of the instinct to 'punch' set in mind, it likely still feels unnatural to be fighting with a softer, palm style, especially when things get heated. It's also difficult to be trained to wait until the very last moment before being struck by an attack to react, to analyze and find the point where the enemy has committed himself totally and dropped all guard in doing so.The reading of movements is very basic at this level, and would normally be unable to keep up in a regularly paced hand to handle conflict. In these beginning stages, it's essential that the student remain static and unmoving, to accustom himself and his eyes to the reaction speed that is necessary for continuing on in Ganjou Taiki.		5	4	Eyeing the UncertainFor someone of the Solid Atmosphere, it is crucial to be able to discern where the enemy is weak, and the earliest point of when that weakness is exposed. It's so daunting a task that many choose to forgo attempting it, but for those who practice Ganjou Taiki, it becomes one of their greatest weapons. Eyeing the Uncertain is a technique constantly being worked upon that teaches students to constantly be searching for the point most vulnerable, identifying and focusing upon that one weak point to strike at an optimum frame of time, disabling the foe.		4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
895	2	2	Solid Atmosphere	Ganjou Taiki	The user is barely any more proficient in this stage than he was the first. Granted, although movements have become a little more natural and appearance, a decreased reaction time serves no purpose because the ability of reading movements has become no better. To the student, it's still all a mystery as to how and when the opponent will attack. The user is still completely vulnerable to feints and tricks, though perhaps slightly more able to adapt to a situation due to an increased physical prowess from training. Attacking with a palm strike still feels somewhat awkward and against what the body desires.		5	4	Striking the UncertainWith what appears to be a simple, weak stroke of a palm, the user attacks the tenderest points of the opponent's body. The actual points of impact can turn out to be quite unorthodox (eg. touching a spot where the enemy is ticklish), but the principle is to disrupt the enemy's current movement. The force behind the palm is not great enough to induce actual pain from the hit, but rather just enough to break up the foe's chain of attacks or preparations for a decisive strike.	Stat Requirements: Control 4, Power 4Kashirajishou: Kasoku (Initial Palm: Acceleration)In order to combat fast opponents and a sluggish reaction time, Acceleration uses bursts of winds to speed up the student's body and limbs instantly, making it seem like they possess a godlike reflexive speed. This elemental enhancement lasts one post for every two Reserves the user possesses.Note:Actual Speed is not increased, it just speeds up swinging an arm for a punch, etc.Nijitekishou: Kizu (Secondary Palm: Cut)Special Requirement: Initial Palm: AccelerationBy focusing his Chakra, the user draws and attracts several slivers of air to circulate and twist around his forearms (or shins). Upon his next strike, the slivers will wind down his arm and hand (or leg), around his palm (or foot), and outwards three inches to cut at the struck point. This means that even if the palm were to miss, as long as it was in a three inch range of the target, the slivers of wind would still hit. The damage inflicted is not too impressive on the grand scheme of things, but the minor cuts can prove to be annoying.	7	0	7	0	0	0	0	6	0
895	3	3	Solid Atmosphere	Ganjou Taiki	The skill of the user is slowly beginning to blossom, taking on the dual beauty and danger of a budding rose as its petals open wide and thorns grow sharp. At this stage, the user learns by experience and capitalizes; reading movements has become proficient enough through pure memorization. The student simply watches how the enemy will punch or kick twice, and on the third punch or kick, the student is then able to recognize and prepare himself to strike before the punch or kick can be fully executed. The longer a battle is drawn out, the better chances get for the practitioner of Solid Atmosphere.Palm strikes are habit now. Though generally fluid, it's still a bit shaky in action. Now and then a kick is thrown into the routine, but the kick is done with neither the foot nor the shin, but rather where the foot meets the shin.		5	4	Knowing the UncertainAfter analyzing and breaking down the weakest, most vulnerable points on a target, the user can now lash out with confidence and assurance, as opposed to the previous stage's insecurity. Hitting these precise points can cause a momentary, intensely acute pain, but missing the spot will be no more potent than a regular strike. Note that these points aren't necessarily pressure points, though they can be.	Stat Requirements: Control 7, Power 7, Reserves 6Kashirajishou: Nijuu Shindou (Initial Palm: Double Impact)By gathering a pocket of wind around both fists and feet, the user holds them there, compact and ready to burst. Upon the next strike, the wind will be released outwards; what makes this different from Nijitekishou: Kizu (Secondary Palm: Cut) is instead of a slashing, abrasive force, Double Impact is a blunt attack, creating a second punch immediately following the first. The actual palm will be the initial, physical hit, while the pocket of wind will make up the second hit (no Strength bonuses included).Nijitekishou: Sasu (Secondary Palm: Pierce)Special Requirement: Secondary Palm: CutSimply a step up from the previous technique's level of power, Pierce operates in the same fashion, though the range of extension is increased to four inches and the damage is also amplified. Instead of minor ignorable cuts, the cuts now actually cause blood to flow freely and require bandaging to stop.	9	0	11	0	0	0	0	8	0
895	4	4	Solid Atmosphere	Ganjou Taiki	Here is where the student begins to undertake the practice of chain attacks, striking in different locations in succession to overwhelm and confuse the opponent. It takes immense concentration because it involves not only hitting the first weak point, but instantly noticing which of the other vulnerable spots close, and which open up, and without hesitation determining the point to hit next for maximum efficiency. The highest chain the user can currently make is two in a row. The style begins to embody the 'hard' elements (as hard as Ganjou Taiki gets, anyway) in the form of elbows and knees, though it is slightly frowned upon to use them.By now the student can actually shift positions while fighting, moving the scene of battle to somewhere more advantageous. Against a speedy opponent, a rocky or sandy terrain would be selected so the enemy will trip or lose footing. Against a brawny opponent, a heavily wooded area would be favourable to provide the user with many hiding spots. Everything has come down to creating as many instances where the opponent loses his focus and thus his guard, opening him up to a flurry of attacks to end the battle. Movement analysis has not much increased, still taking two attacks in order to successfully recognize the muscles being shifted.		5	4	Shortening the UncertainThrough various practices and studies on living opponents (usually through spars), the student now applies the precise amount of force on the exact spot of weakness against an enemy to produce a greater amount of pain. It is often surprising to the adversary when the user seemingly strikes with a palm, yet such a high level of agony is created.Earth and SkyMaking use of the newly learned chain attacks, the student begins to immerse himself with various techniques on a higher level to increase potential damage. In Heaven and Earth, the user first attacks with a palm strike anywhere against the opponent. Immediately after, he will lean his body forwards and lift a leg back, up, and over his own body to strike the enemy full on in the face for a second consecutive hit.Face the HeavensYet another chain move, the user first throws his elbow into his adversary's gut, following that up with a swift palm up against the chin to snap the enemy's head back and face towards the sky. However, because of such a rough, 'hard' set of movements, Face the Heavens is not looked upon happily by teachers of Ganjou Taiki.	Stat Requirements: Control 10, Power 10, Reserves 8Kashirajishou: Hakuryokujishou (Initial Palm: Force Palm)By thrusting forth a palm, the user creates a gale of wind in the shape of his palm that is sent through the air. The Force Palm travels for ten feet and carries the full power of the user (No Strength bonuses from this style included). The most notable aspect of this move is that although it retains the shape of the open hand, the size is increased twenty fold so that the palm-fashioned gale is five feet in height and three feet in width. It's been known that once, after bowling a target over with powerful, blunt force, the gale continued onwards to hit a boulder and imprint itself in the stone face, though the validity of this rumour has yet to be verified.Note: When done to an opponent equal in rank (eg. Chuunin vs Chuunin), the target is only pushed back a few steps. When done to an opponent one lower in rank (eg. Chuunin vs Genin), the target is knocked to the ground. When done to an opponent two lower in rank (eg. Jounin vs Genin), the target is carried off in the wind for a short distance. When done to an opponent three lower in rank (eg. Sennin vs Genin), the target is knocked out from the sheer direct power of the attack.Nijitekishou: Kirikizu (Secondary Palm: Gash)Special Requirement: Secondary Palm: PierceThe fourth technique in the Secondary Palm line, Gash operates the exact same way as the previous Pierce, though now moderate slash wounds are inflicted on the target with a maximum five inch outward extension. Being hit by enough of these could take the fight completely out of a man, though it would require a fair number in order to reach that point.	14	14	15	0	0	0	0	14	0
895	5	5	Solid Atmosphere	Ganjou Taiki	The student - now capable of being a teacher to a novice - is now a tranquil machine of analysis. No movement of the enemy goes unduly noticed as everything is taken into an account. The philosophy of each Shinobi having his own tell before striking is taken to heart by the practitioner of the Solid Atmosphere. Palm strikes are firm and accurate while kicks are slightly more frequent (though palms are still heavily preferred). The ability of reading movements has been honed to a greater extent, now only taking one attack in order to recognize it for the next occurrence. Chains have been increased to three in consecutive actions.Everything the user does now exudes an aura of confidence, an almost smug assurance that makes opponents think twice before rushing in to attack. The fact that a tactic becomes increasingly harder to land against the user usually instils a mild anxiety within the untrained adversary's mind.Reaction speed is a fraction of what it used to be before practicing Ganjou Taiki. Students at this level can adapt and adjust in a third of the time it once took, making their previous state of being look like a sluggish, uncouth beast of a fighter.		5	4	Unveiling the UncertainDue to the vast improvement the student has achieved through rigorous training, picking out and upon a weak point is now second nature. With great effectiveness, the palm strikes in such a way to cause an inordinate level of pain if the strike were to land on the precise point of vulnerability. Striking a certain tendon or muscle sends waves of acute pain throughout the target's body.	Stat Requirements: Control 15, Power 15, Reserves 13Nijitekishou: Kiri Ude Dageki (Secondary Palm: Drill Arm Strike)Initiating this technique causes twin coils of wind to begin to spin around the user's forearms. The coils spin at a terrifying speed and extend outwards three feet, able to drill through wood (instant) and wear away stone and metal (after one post). The drills last one post to begin with, and an extra post for every stage higher than the current (Stage Five) the student knows for a max of three posts at Stage Seven.Nijitekishou: Houmen Tei Sakuretsu (Secondary Palm: Releasing Air Explosion)Special Requirement: Secondary Palm: GashThis is not your typical Secondary Palm technique, and it is obvious right from the get go. By focusing Chakra around his entire body, the user begins to compress a great deal of wind all about his dominant arm, flowing constantly. Then, the wind explodes outwards for five feet with a great concussive force equal to an explosive tag.Note: This takes one post beforehand to prepare where no other jutsu or techniques can be used. Furthermore, it counts as the user's offensive action for that post as well as the offensive action for the next post immediately after where the blast is released. This requires one post of cooldown after the blast.	18	17	21	0	0	0	0	16	0
895	6	6	Solid Atmosphere	Ganjou Taiki	The student of the Solid Atmosphere is a strange, yet wonderful thing to behold in combat. He reacts at a blinding speed with beautiful palm strikes, now even whirling and revolving upon a pivot foot to get around and behind the target; movements are established with a personal flair, making each student's form at this stage slightly unique. Movement analysis has not actually increased in that it takes one attack to successfully recognize it again, but now the user can at least attempt to predict the strike, getting the creeping feeling upon seeing the opponent's muscles shift themselves to attack.Chains have increased to four consecutive hits.		5	4	Recognizing the UncertainBy testing and striking the various weak points of the enemy, the user begins to learn which ones are most vulnerable and induce the greatest amount of pain. It is no longer random which weak point to strike, but only the most dire of weaknesses are exploited and exposed to a major effect. When a tender area is struck by the mighty palm of the Solid Atmosphere practitioner, an immense amount of pain is felt, much more than there should be.	Stat Requirements: Control 19, Power 19, Reserves 18Kashirajishou: Munashii Kannyou (Initial Palm: Void Collapse)Special Requirement: Initial Palm: Force PalmAs one of the most physically devastating techniques in the entire style of Solid Atmosphere, Void Collapse is a move not to be taken or used lightly. When striking the opponent with a palm (like normal), the student will suddenly channel all the air around the opponent into a torrent of wind that goes up the user's arm, across his body and harmlessly out of the other. This effectively creates a vacuum around the hapless target, a bubble where no oxygen is present. However, this bubble lasts only for a split second to disorient the victim; as air is ever flowing, it will rush back in to fill the void. Because it was sucked out so rapidly, though, the air rushing back in will do so at an equally rapid rate. In other words, the air rushing back in will be so fast that it actually strikes the target with a heavy blunt force from all sides, great enough to fracture bones if the opponent is unlucky. Small objects are even drawn towards the opponent by suction; The student must be careful not to also be pulled inwards. Void Collapse is an extremely taxing move and thus can only be used twice in any encounter, and both cannot be executed in the same chain attack.Nijitekishou: Sasu Kyuuten (Secondary Palm: Pierce the Heavens)Special Requirement: Secondary Palm: GashThe true might of Ganjou Taiki's mastery over wind is revealed in this technique. It is initiated exactly the same as Secondary Palm: Gash, though a greater amount of wind is compressed, so great that the user's clothes and hair usually flail about. The student will then press both palms against the ground, releasing all of the air into it. The current of wind then travels swiftly through the ground (to a maximum of ten feet), piercing upwards underneath the target almost right after the user's palms touch the earth. The current of wind is fierce enough to rend an unsuspecting target in two and send debris flying everywhere. Pierce the Heavens can only be used once every three posts.	26	22	27	0	0	0	17	19	0
895	7	7	Solid Atmosphere	Ganjou Taiki	To fight the user is to now face defeat, for their analysis of movement is so complete they can lash out to break up an opponent's attack without even having seen it before, simply through trained practice of reading and understanding how the muscles move. Granted, there may be the unorthodox fighter in the bunch, but with time even he is overcome after a short period of observation and adjustment. Their movements are seamless and offer few windows of vulnerability - after all, after mastering a style that capitalizes on open weak points, by now the user has learned to close all of his up.It is not the raging heat of the desert sun that you must fear, but the below zero temperatures of the desert night that creep up and freeze the air in your lungs.Chain attacks are increased to five.		5	4	Uncertain No MoreIt is shocking how a forceful stroke of a palm can lead to so much pain, but that is what the touch of the master has become. Weaknesses are blatant in his eyes, lit up by neon signs that glow and indicate where to hit, that beg him to strike. It is an unnerving agony that the victim feels when struck in a location they never knew to be vulnerable, but by the time they realize it, it's far too late.	Stat Requirements: Control 26, Power 25, Reserves 24Ketteitekishou: Shuujitsu no Nanpuu (Final Palm: Breeze of Autumn)Special Requirement: Initial Palm: Void Collapse, Secondary Palm: Pierce the HeavensThe only Secondary Palm technique that requires one of the Initial Palm, Breeze of Autumn is a hybrid move that incorporates the slashing function of the Secondary Palm line with the execution of Void Collapse. When striking with a palm, large slivers of wind will converge all around the target to deal slashing and stabbing damage instead of blunt force, though the rest of the technique is identical in nature.Like the leaves that grow brown and are carried away in the wind, so will the enemy fall away from this world and be borne onto the next by the Breeze of Autumn.This technique needs one full, uninterrupted ('interrupted' meaning no attacking or using a jutsu) post of concentration. Breeze of Autumn's effect can be sustained for three posts before requiring a three post cooldown.	35	29	35	0	0	0	21	23	0
894	1	1	Desert Fist	Sabaku Kenfu	10 pounds of sand in each weight.As a novice to the style and still not used to the added weight of the Sagan Omori, the user tends to be quite awkward and slow in movements. However, it is in this stage that the fundamentals of the style are established. Slow, precise movements backed by steady power are preferred as opposed to the nimble, dodging movements of other practices. However, that is not to say that the user is rigid and unbending; quite the contrary, the user is trained to be supple and flexible (though at this point it's nothing fantastic) to deliver an immediate counter attack from any angle. At this point in time, though, the counters are sluggish and movements are clunky.	4	2	3	Twin HammersA basic technique, the user will strike with both fists. Instead of holding the fists horizontally like a normal punch, they will be 'vertical', and one fist will punch out higher than the other - only by two inches or so - to spread out the force of the blow, yet still maintain a sense of localization. This is most often done to counter as opposed to an initiating assault as to do this offensively often would be quite awkward and unwieldy.	Stat Requirements: Control 2, Power 2Personal DesertAlthough the sand is usually carried about in the weights, there are times when it is brought out for use and bits fall to the ground. Under normal circumstances, this would mean that the user's supply of sand would gradually diminish until he had nothing left; with this beginner technique, it amplifies the sand's attuning to his Chakra signature. For every stage of Sabaku Kenfu the user knows, the field of Personal Desert increases by two feet (starting at two feet for Stage One). If the sand falls within range, it will follow him about until drawn back into the weights by Chakra or used for another special technique. If the sand falls outside of the field, all the user has to do is step within range to pick it back up.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
894	2	2	Desert Fist	Sabaku Kenfu	[I] Twenty-five pounds of sand in each weight./I]Getting more and more accustomed to the extra weight is a difficult task completed only through hard training. Just as the user was adapting to the ten pound level, the weights were increased to twenty-five per. Although it would seem as if this would set the user all the way back to square one, surprisingly, it isn't so. The practitioner already understands the basics of applying extra weight to movements; starting up movements takes double the amount of effort, but the overall power is amplified by so much because of the added momentum. It's more common for those of the Desert Fist to fight in a rhythmic type of motion, attacking in short but flurried batteries of sweeps, kicks, punches, and backhand swipes. Instead of maintaining a long string of combat, he will pause and retreat, only to strike again. Doing so minimizes an opponent's chances at countering as well as empowering the user to decide when the encounters will take place.	4	2	3	Counter PalmA simple move to counter simple attacks, the user simply waits until his adversary lashes out with a punch. With his non-dominant hand, the user will then use the palm to force aside the assaulting fist off course so that it shoots wide. With the open lane, the user will then use the other fist to attack.Counter KneeSimilar to Counter Palm, this move requires that the foe first starts with a kick. The user will then lunge forwards with a knee to stunt the attack before launching his own kick with the other leg.	Stat Requirements: Control 4, Power 4Limbs of ShukakuUtilising all the sand in the weights, the user covers his hands, forearms, feet, and shins in a layer of packed sand, much like the sandstone state the sand is in within the weights. Offering only minimal defensive capabilities (can resist a Strength level lower than that of the user's; equal or higher levels will break the compact sand), the sand layer is actually used to give an additional level of damage in the form of irritation: The grains of sand rub against the point of impact like sandpaper. The coating stays in place one post for every stage of Sabaku Kenfu the student knows.	7	7	0	0	0	0	0	6	0
894	3	3	Desert Fist	Sabaku Kenfu	40 pounds of sand in each weight.While the sand in each weight has been increased to a hefty forty pounds, the user now has become adept at adjusting the strength required to put into his movements for combat - to an extent. Aerial techniques, while few in this style, are still slow and leave many openings, while extended strings of attacks grow more sluggish as the user attempts to time them all appropriately and act accordingly. Breaking up assaults into short bursts is definitely more beneficial to the user in the long run as it allows his muscles to recuperate for a split second before rocketing back into the fray. The movements themselves, while still a tad slower than the normal pace of battle, possess a sense of certainty and assuredness behind them now. No longer is the feeling that the user can barely control his own momentum; he is in control, more or less.Weight transfer is especially crucial at this stage in training. Even a slight shift in weight can reduce a bone-crushing punch into a glancing strike. Flexibility is key in this as it allows the user to move with the flow, leaning backwards from an attack to absorb some of the force before retaliating and so on. The user learns approximately how much force is needed to initiate an attack and no more, thereby cutting back on expending excess strength; however, because of the additional weight on a limb, it makes it fairly obvious which limb the user will be attacking with.	4	2	3	InterceptIn name, Intercept is a simple technique, but in execution much more difficult. By now, the user has either seen enough battle or gone through enough practice to hone his reactions that he is able to catch an opponent's arm or leg in a punch/kick. One hand will grasp the limb from below while the other locks in from above with a vice-like grip.Requires target permission since it grapples and keeps a firm hold on the target.Bombs AwayHere is where the user gets creative; usually initiated by spinning or some sort of movement to increase momentum and use the advantage of impetus, the user will slide one of the weights off of a limb and launch it directly at the opponent. If the weight were to hit, it would hit with the force of the user's Strength including bonuses (bonuses of the weights being on), making this a sort of ranged punch or kick. The disadvantage, of course, is obvious in that the user will lose the weight and can only perform Bombs Away four times (unless he retrieves the weights in between).	Stat Requirements: Control 7, Power 7, Reserves 6Fishing LineFishing Line seems like a useless technique in and of itself, but when used in tandem with other tactics can become rather handy and frustrating to the opponent. The user draws out thin ribbons of sand and loops them around his wrists and ankles (one per weight) so that he can flail the weights around like weapons, and if he were to throw one (eg. Bombs Away), he could retrieve them via pulling back on the line of sand. The lines only extend for ten feet and can be maintained for one post per three Reserves before a one post cooldown.	10	10	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
894	4	4	Desert Fist	Sabaku Kenfu	65 pounds of sand in each weight.The user's repertoire is now filled with what could be denoted as 'power moves'. Solid punches and devastating kicks are all tools of the user to be employed at will. The focus is to outlast the opponent; if it becomes a test of pure brawn, then the user and his opponent will go toe to toe. If the adversary is speedier but lightweight, all the Desert Fist fighter must do is wait for an opportune moment to strike and end the bout with a single blow. All moves from this point onwards are methodical and with a specific purpose; patience serves the practitioner well as sooner or later the enemy must commit an error, however small it may be. Weight transfer has been worked upon so that the moves the user intends to make are not as blatant.	4	2	3	InvertSpecial Requirement: An opponent's limb must have been Intercepted and currently in the grasp of the user.A gruesome move, at best. With the foe's arm or leg in a bind, the user will raise his elbow and bring it down on the trapped arm/leg's joint, forcing it in the opposite direction it's intended to go. This instantly breaks the joint and renders the limb useless.	Stat Requirements: Control 10, Power 10, Reserves 8Two Hit ComboThis technique is what the style has been building up to, and where it takes flight. Taking all of the available sand in the weights (which is a fair amount, to be frank) the user creates a layer of sand over his hands, forearms, feet, and shins. What's special about this particular layer is it leaves an empty buffer space of two inches between itself and the user's actual skin. This way, if the user lands a punch, it actually lands two punches: First the layer of sand, then the fist itself. The sand layer has a Strength equal to half of the user's (including bonuses, but the bonuses as if the weights are on). The layer doesn't do much defensively and lasts one post for every five points of Reserves.	14	15	14	0	0	0	0	14	0
894	5	5	Desert Fist	Sabaku Kenfu	100 pounds of sand in each weight.This point of training is what most teachers of the Desert Fist refer to as `the wall`. Students, for some reason, lack the ability to raise their ability past that of the previous stage. However, those that do become fearsome in their own respect. They battle with a furious rapidity, relenting at the oddest of moments to break the opponent's rhythm and concentration. Diverting the enemy's attack becomes a mere option now; the user commands enough power to simply strike back to nullify an assault, punch for punch, or backhanding an attack to knock it aside.The feet also now come into play more than ever. Kicks can be as useful, if not more so, than punches. Attacks that drive the heel into an opponent's body (eg. axe kick) pique the user's interest because of their 'finishing move' classification. If anything, the user's main strategy at this point is to end a battle as quickly as possible, before the opponent can get a chance to react. 'Tit for tat' is not an acceptable philosophy.	4	2	3	Temple BashKnown to be a less-than-honourable move, the user will bring both fists inwards to crush the victim's temples. It can cause an intense, almost overpowering pain in the target so much so that his head will spin and vision blur for a few moments; those weak in body (eg. non-Shinobi) have been known to lose consciousness after being struck in such a manner.	Stat Requirements: Control 15, Power 15, Reserves 13Three Hit ComboSpecial Requirement: Two Hit ComboBuilding off of the foundations from Two Hit Combo, Three Hit Combo creates a secondary layer underneath the first one, directly in between the outermost sand and the user's skin (one inch apart from each). Not only does this mean a single hit really means three hits, but the layers actually move. The top layer slowly spins counter-clockwise while the second layer slowly rotates clockwise. This generates enough friction to irritate and redden an opponent's exposed skin (or tear through soft fabrics). The first (outer) layer hits with a force equal to a quarter of the user's Strength, while the inner layer hits with a half of the user's Strength (both including bonuses, but bonuses as if the weights are on). The layering lasts one post for every eight points of Reserves.	18	20	18	0	0	0	0	16	0
894	6	6	Desert Fist	Sabaku Kenfu	150 pounds of sand in each weight.Now standing at one of the upper tiers in physical combat, the practitioner of the Desert Fist is truly a being to be respected. His moves are quick, but not hasty, strong, but not vicious, controlled, but not restricted. Battles are started and finished within minutes under the user's onslaught; however, this is not to say that he has become a bloodthirsty fighting machine. The user has just become so efficient in combat that he has become adept at ending skirmishes quickly. A prolonged fight does neither combatant any good, it only wears them out and increases the probability of lasting, lifelong injuries.	4	2	3	Iron ClawIron Claw is the one pre-emptive move to halt a fight before it can even begin. Taking his dominant hand, the user will reach out and attempt to latch onto the opponent's: Face, neck, or left bicep. From that point, all he does is squeeze. Hard. So hard that if the grip is on the face, the victim usually succumbs to the massive pain and surrenders. If the grip is on the neck or left bicep, it actually slows the circulation of blood to weaken and knock out the victim (but is far from being in danger of dying).	Stat Requirements: Control 19, Power 19, Reserves 18Desert SweepThis user will draw his dominant arm across to the opposite side (right arm will go to left, left to right) and all of his sand will focus about that arm. When the enemy attacks, the user will merely sweep back the other way in a backhand type of stroke, something that the user has likely done many times before now. However, the sand is unleashed in a monstrous blast to not only deflect attacks, but send the attacker reeling. Projectiles are negated and physical strikes based on a Strength level equal to the user's minus two (and all subsequent lower Strength levels) are voided. Even Ninjutsu up to Stage Three are nullified. The blast of sand is ferocious enough to sting exposed flesh. Desert Sweep can only be done once every four posts.	25	25	25	0	0	0	16	20	0
894	7	7	Desert Fist	Sabaku Kenfu	200 pounds of sand in each weight.Only the highest echelons of hand-to-hand combat can hope to achieve this level of might. The user is now a mountain - or should it be dune? - of confidence and strength, immovable by all except the most terrifying of forces. The principles of combat still remain the same; intense bursts of combat interrupted now and then to break up the opponent's concentration at such a fierce rapidity that the untrained victims can only stand by and be beaten to a pulp.	4	2	3	Counter CrushCounter Palm and Knee have been taken to a new level. Instead of simply averting an attack, the user will mirror the opponent's move and strike directly into it, using sheer power to overwhelm the enemy's limbs and injure them (eg. the user punches an opponent's punch, sending enough recoil that the opponent's elbow and shoulder would dislocate). However, this kind of move requires utmost precision to pull off or else it simply negates the attack and leaves a stinging pain in the opponent, rather than dealing its maximum damage. Because of the focus required, Counter Crush cannot be done in quick succession. At best, it can be performed once every two posts while the user analyzes the enemy's movements to determine where exactly to strike.	Stat Requirements: Control 26, Power 25, Reserves 24The Desert is my WeaponSpecial Requirement Personal DesertWith the mastery of sand control, the user can now form a jagged, double ended spike out of compacted sand in the air. The spike can then be launched to rocket towards the target with the intent of impaling. One spike takes all the sand from a single weight, so four spikes can be formed at once anywhere within the radius of Personal Desert. The spike itself is massive, roughly four feet long and two feet in diameter. However, the spike must remain within the area of Personal Desert or else it will disintegrate.Drill Bit ComboSpecial Requirement: Three Hit ComboAt this near-forbidden level, the sand has become something immensely wrong. Like in Three Hit Combo, two layers are formed above the user's limbs. However, the gaps have increased to six inches for the outer layer and three inches for the inner. Both layers spin in opposite directions again, but this time at such a speed that they function like primitive drills. They can actually grind through an inch thick panel of wood, making it easy work to eat away at skin. The topmost layer hits with a Strength equal to half of the user's, while the inner layer hits at three quarters (including bonuses, but bonuses as if the weights were on). The layering lasts one post for every fifteen points of Reserves.	34	34	31	0	0	0	20	24	0
893	1	1	Shroud of the Penitent	Zaika	Only recently Bound, the Penitent has little control over their Zaika at this level. Their Zaika adapts to necessity; covering however much of the body the Penitent wishes, hiding any kunai within their folds where the Penitent may draw them out at any instant. Likewise, the Zaika may act as both sheathe and strap for larger weapons, for everything from cleaver swords to tanto. It is also possible to hide the Zaika beneath more mundane clothes for subterfuge, if necessary.At this stage they can only simply manipulate their Zaika, forcing it to stiffen or loosen according to their whims. They can use it to create a warm bed for themselves, or pick simple locks. They 'feel' anything that touches their Zaika as though it touched their bare skin, though there is no pain. The Penitent always knows exactly where it is, even if they are not currently in contact with it.	0					0	0	0	0	0	0	3	5	0
893	2	2	Shroud of the Penitent	Zaika	The Penitent has begun to learn how to fine-tune their control of their Zaika; through further manipulation of the fabric they have become able to wrap themselves entirely in the material, keeping themselves safe from both extreme heat and cold so long as it is mundane in nature. (Steady snowfall in Snow as opposed to ice Jutsu, or a blistering hot day as opposed to Katon)Through a combination of steady chakra pressure and precise control, the Penitent is capable of cause a razor-although it is part of the Zaika, it is sturdy as iron, more of a knife, really-of four inches to sprout from any part of the Zaika in direct contact with their body. This razor can be maintained for as long as the Penitent likes, but once it is retracted they must wait four posts before creating another.While not strong enough to provide any real pushing or pulling force, the Zaika can now be used as a semi-prehensile limb reaching up to a meter away from the Penitent. It cannot, say, throw a kunai. But it could open a door, or switch off a light.	0					0	0	0	0	0	0	6	8	0
893	3	3	Shroud of the Penitent	Zaika	The Penitent grows ever more powerful. Now they are not only capable of manipulating the texture and shape of the Zaika, but the color. They have trained in camouflaging against all backgrounds, and the instinct bleeds through as their Zaika constantly tries to make itself transparent as they move, giving the edges of a Penitent's Zaika a faded look. However, they cannot truly use this to hide unless they stand completely still, and unless a watcher's vision was otherwise hindered they would likely notice anyway.With this new proficiency Zaika's razors can grow twice as long as they could before, to a whooping eight inches. Many of the Penitent use this to sprout the razor at their knuckles or wrists, so they can parry a blow or make a quick swipe at an enemy with their makeshift knife.	0					0	0	0	0	8	0	8	12	0
893	4	4	Shroud of the Penitent	Zaika	Though the Zaika will never truly be strong enough to injure another shinobi it is at least capable of bearing the Penitent's weight. Its range has extended from one meter to three, though it can only 'grab' one object at a time. A Penitent might be able to use this to retrieve a discarded katana, or pull them out of a bed of quicksand.The Zaika has evolved into a protective mechanism adept at protecting the Penitent so that they can fulfill their oath. At will the Penitent can call up the Zaika to surround them and defend them from attack, (blocks stage two) however such a defense leaves no room for a countermove. (No offensive action) It also expends twice as much effort to block a technique as it did to cast it in the first place. (Blocking stage one takes two stage one usages, stage two requires two stage two . . . so on)	0					0	0	0	0	14	0	14	16	13
893	5	5	Shroud of the Penitent	Zaika	At last the Zaika's ability to blend into the surroundings has reached its peak. While there is no change in the way they move about without effort, when the Penitent focuses entirely (no offensive action) on remaining unseen, their Zaika can cause them to become entirely transparent, creating near perfect invisibility. This of course does not hide any other signs of their passing.Time and training has made the Penitent and their Zaika truly remarkable. They may now fashion a razor 16 inches long, sturdy enough to fend off katana and most other medium-sized swords in a duel. The time it takes before one can recreate the blade has shortened slightly (three posts), giving the Penitent yet another advantage. Their defense has grown more effective, too.

893	6	6	Shroud of the Penitent	Zaika	The Zaika has become a sort of second skin for the Penitent, and they've grown as familiar with it as they are with any other part of themselves. Even when the rest of the body shuts down, the Zaika remains active. When their limbs refuse to move, whether through ripped tendons, paralysis or intense numbness, the Penitent can use their Zaika and force their body to work the way they needTheir defense itself has grown stronger (stage four) and more versatile; now able to protect not only the Penitent but another ally close by.As the Penitent grows more aware of their Zaika's exact position, they can use it to tend to themselves when wounded. A Penitent with this much skill can use their Zaika to bandage and seal any wound almost immediately. Internal bleeding is still very much a problem, but there is no chance that the Penitent will die of bleeding out.	0					0	0	0	18	18	0	25	29	21
893	7	7	Shroud of the Penitent	Zaika	The Penitent has enough control of their Zaika to temporarily spike their manipulative prowess to remarkable levels, even by itself. They are capable of creating a limb-arm or leg-fully functional, from any part of the Zaika touching their skin. It can be used to increase ones reach, to grab where one would not ordinarily be able to grab, or outright replace a limb if necessary. For a time (three posts) they can sustain this, dismantling and replacing the artificial limb in different areas across their bodies. Afterwards their Zaika is rendered weak, incapable of fulfilling any but the most basic functions (stage three) for a time. (Three posts)Their Zaika's natural defense has reached the pinnacle of its abilities. (Stage Five) They can also shield up to two others in it, should they so choose.The Zaika has become far more useful in a mundane sense as well. They can extend two five-meter prehensile strands at once, though they are not dexterous enough to grab another skilled practitioner in combat. However, when a Penitent grabs someone, or are grabbed, they may use their Zaika to seize the person and keep them within their five-meter limit, whether to prevent escape or hinder movement.	0					0	0	0	20	24	0	33	35	31
892	1	1	Divine Swords of the Wind	Kaze no Shinken	Control Range: 3m radial sphere (6m diameter)Focus: The neophyte's concentration will be split between retaining their Shinken, holding their sword correctly, maintaining sight of their opponent and utilising their blade to attack and defend. Although each aspect will be less effective as a result, it is a sacrifice that must be made and an ability that must be mastered at this point before the official sword schools can be taught.Movement: Meditative kata introduce the student to linear strides and straight-armed movements, subtly improving power output and confidence in completing sword swings and staying upright when attempting to include simple footwork.Unarmed: If the used is ever disarmed, which at this stage can occur quite frequently, they will be taught to raise a double forearm guard to protect their nose while they reestablish a connection with the nearest blade to rearm themselves.Shinken:Due to their fledgling capacity to control this ability. The user will be able to summon a sword to hand from their reserve supply within the same post but be unable to reconnect with any discarded/disarmed sword until their next post.Cradle: The practitioner's 'cradle' refers to the array of armoury blades that they are able to suspend within their control sphere. As the number of weapons available and the space in which they can be held aloft increases, the cradle will also expand to form new shapes around the user. At this stage, swords merely float to either side in an intimidating display.Swordsmanship: Training begins by learning how to properly hold small, medium and large blades and maintain one's grip -- single- for the former two or two-handed for the latter -- while performing rudimentary cuts, slashes and thrusts. As the student's armoury will often consist of a variety of weaponry, it is essential that their body learn to anticipate variances in weight, length and balance. The user's skill in defending extends to simple sweeps of the sword to interrupt, possibly deflecting attacks.	d	4	5		Control-2, Power-2Shinken (Divine Swords)This fundamental technique permits the user to manipulate their blades using chakra and will scale in strength as detailed above, and duration as below.Base: 3 post duration (including activation); 3 post cool-down.Stage 3: 6 post duration (including activation); 2 post cool-down.Stage 5: 9 post duration (including activation); 1 post cool-down.Kenshutsu: Shiraberu (Detection School: Search)Base: By sorting the scents of various materials to automatically recognise leathers, metals, woods and fibres, the student can detect the existence of hidden weapons or armours.Stage 2: With a solid working knowledge of armament materials that can be found in the Wind Country, the user can deduce the molecular composition of their opponents' items to gauge density and toughness.Stage 3: A broader sensory understanding of both domestic and foreign craft materials will allow the user to ascertain the quality of items in range and, if modified, a reliable sense of any altered functions.	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
892	2	2	Divine Swords of the Wind	Kaze no Shinken	Control Range: 3m radial sphere (6m diameter)Focus: This aspect will improve rapidly as a result of thorough application and highly regulated meditation in early learning. There is now less of a physical strain to balance what were once rather disparate concepts; the user's improving control over their aerial blades parallels the benefits they receive from rigorous training in sword schools. However, the user's battle concentration is still quite narrow and only allows them to engage single enemies.Movement: The next kata taught to the student will help improve the rotation of their hip and shoulder joints, quickening response times and expanding the user's range of footwork -- from the low, circular sweeps of the leg to the quick shuffles that can be employed to advance or evade.Unarmed: Using their shoulders more, the student's guard can now attempt to better fend off blunt impacts made against the sides of the head as well as the neck and chest. However, this defence will prove highly ineffective against bladed or chakra-based attacks, hence the user begins to use inside parries with open palms across the body to deflect rather than absorb whenever possible. Some students choose to wear thick gloves for help turning bladed weapons aside.Shinken: The student is now more confident in their manipulation of aerial blades. Sword schools will carry their own patterns for aligning and delivering the intent behind Shinken. Through this, the movement of these blades gains purpose, control and finesse, strongly resembling the user's own swordsmanship.Cradle: Swords begin to fan out more purposefully like the feather tips of angel wings, sliding into the hand from just behind the user. The speed of this 'feed' resembles a sword falling into range by gravity, and thus can be foiled by the opponent unless the weapon is close enough to grasp easily. One of the most effective uses of this cradle shape is to split the blades and send them in either direction around their body with a strong wave of their handheld sword in order to create a static barrier in front of them.Swordsmanship: True skill with the blade begins at this stage with the introduction to two tactically diverse sword schools. The student will be trained to assess their situation in order to select the best strategy for the entire conflict. Switching between the stances that underpin each school during combat will otherwise be an awkward process that exposes the user to harm.Dual Wielding School: Sword Skills of the Mind Weaponry: Medium sword (primary), small sword (secondary). Dove Stance (Attack): With feet at ninety degrees in the en-garde position, knees bent slightly and weight on the back foot, arms are raised to match. The primary blade extends over the front foot and secondary blade, supported by a horizontal bend in the elbow to cross its steel over the leading arm in a line of defense. Guard Stance: Opening the en-garde position, the user's body turns to face the opponent, both arms extended to cross their blades defensively before them like a pair of scissors. Bladework: The user begins to feel out their opponents while learning where their own blind spots lie, shuffling forward to thwip the tip of their primary blade in small slashes or the curving, inward sweep of a 'Dove Cut', aiming to keep their distance. They are only to use their secondary blade to block should an opponent step too close, shuffling back as soon as possible. It is still too early to wield both in unison, but even this simple parry and skip will provide ample opportunity for a timely risposte.Two-Handed School: Sword of No Mind Weaponry: Large blade (two-handed) Eagle Stance (Attack): With feet in the en-garde position, knees bent slightly, weight is placed on the front foot and the arms are held to the side. Both hands are evenly spaced along the hilt, one just under the guard (dominant) and other midway along the haft (subordinate), both arms bent at the elbow to raise the tip of the sword. Guard Stance: None. Bladework: The momentum generated from the ravager's rush can be a heady lure for the novice swordsman. Pulling with the subordinate arm and pushing with the dominant as they lunge forwards will result in a powerful upward slash across the body, termed the 'Eagle Strike'. Yet without the dexterity to match this power, the student will be forced to drop back into their starting stance, possibly shifting their hands to attack from the other side. Though forceful, offense is relatively slow and one-dimensional.	d	4	5		Control-4, Power-4Tobutori (Flying Bird)The user will be able to launch a single, high speed sword like an arrow by bunching its scent trail like a spring, coiled taught by chakra, then releasing the weapon (3 post cooldown).Base: Can launch a single small, medium or large sword.Stage 3: Can launch two large swords in different directions; 2 post cooldown.Stage 4: Can launch three swords of any size in different directions; 1 post cooldown.	0	6	8	0	0	0	0	6	0
892	3	3	Divine Swords of the Wind	Kaze no Shinken	Control Range: 4.5m radial sphere (9m diameter)Focus: With less conscious effort now channeled into sustaining Shinken, more can be spent on the subconscious fine tuning of one's awareness and memory. Working from a mixture of visual and sensory clues, the user will endeavour to keep track of the number of opponents within range so that they can better navigate their surroundings, engaging up to two enemies if necessary, and cover blind spots with their blades.Movement: The next series of kata will begin to soften pressures on the wrist, elbow, knee and ankle joints, creating smoother, quicker and sharper blows and blocks, as well as simple chained attacks. By directing more power through their legs, the user will start to implement new footwork, including spins and hops, while gaining access to basic acrobatic moves like handsprings and tucks. Leaping twirls into and out of combat will often be favoured for their stylistic application, as the cradle can be fanned around them like a swirling cloak of feathers.Unarmed: Before the kid gloves can come off, the student must receive training in one other aspect of unarmed defense -- that of a slow offense. Quick jabs and lateral hooks are trained into muscle memory to strike sparingly at opportune moments, while the straight kick to the gut becomes a go-to move when all else fails to suppress an opponent's advance. Though basic in nature, and relatively ineffective against opponents at a similar stage in pure hand-to-hand schools, these surprise attacks are worth their salt when used alongside bladework.Shinken: Control over this aspect is such that the user will be able to maintain a connection with their swords at all times whilst the weapons are in range. Finesse behind aerial manoeuvres has also improved, allowing the student to precisely mirror all of their manual techniques and deliver them synchronously from any point within range.Cradle: The small crescent floating behind the user can also function as a rear guard -- a barrier of sharp, pointy things that will generally dissuade lesser opponents from attempting a sneak attack. With greater variety also comes less awkward transitions in the feed, as the precise weapon desired for its tactical advantage is more likely to be available. Unfortunately, observant foes may yet notice that the bottom-most sword is most often the next in line; the user still lacks the necessary flair for misdirection.Swordsmanship: Although switching between schools will be easier to do at this stage, most adepts still prefer to stick to one or the other based on their read of the situation. As their familiarity with each sword stance deepens, they will better understand the reciprocal relationship between the movements of body and sword and how to alleviate certain physical pressures to improve balance and flow.Dual Wielding School: Sword Skills of the Mind Weaponry: Medium sword (primary), medium sword (secondary). Dove Stance I (Attack): Users can now switch between one side and the other in the space of a step. Guard Stance I: Bending the elbows slightly brings this criss-cross guard closer but improves force absorption. Bladework: Noted improvements to the user's speed, power and control will usher in a new era of experimentation. Turning to the flat of the steel, the student will look to numb and deaden muscle groups with repeated blows before moving in for the finishing thrust. Handling two medium swords with improved fluidity and intricacy has also allowed the user to coordinate their strikes more successfully. This means that they are beginning to dart forward out of their balanced stance to attack with both blades, and then fall back into it to block with both where necessary.Two-Handed School: Sword of No Mind Weaponry: Large blade (two-handed) Eagle Stance I (Attack): The grip has loosened to dip the blade and remove excess tension in the lower arms. Guard Stance: None. Bladework: Gains in strength and dexterity have led the user to develop the manner in which they handle their sword. Unlike other two-handed styles, in which there will always be a dominant and subordinate arm and return slashes can be made by crossing and uncrossing one's forearms at the apex of their strike, the Sword of No Mind practitioner has more control over their blade. Supporting the weapon's weight and positioning with Shinken, it is possible to reverse their grip at the apex of each strike instead, sliding their dominant hand over to the middle of the hilt and their subordinate up to just under the guard. As a result, both arms are trained to deliver equally powerful Eagle Strikes. The student is learning to cover the style's perceived weaknesses and reduce openings. Combinations are now possible with this more fluid movement, resulting in prolonged barrages.	d	4	5	Regular Technique: Ten no Keikoku (Heaven's Warning) Launching forwards in a short sprint, each inward twirl of the adept's sword will connect with a corresponding footstep, delivering 3 jarring strikes using the flat of the blade before dancing back lightly to continue the match. Regular Technique: Tengoku no Fuwa (Heaven's Discord) Unleashing a short combination rush of full power Eagle Strikes, the adept releases their hilt mid-way through the final upward slash, holding the blade stationary with Shinken as if time itself has stopped. Continuing to use the inertia of their swing, however, the ravager doesn't miss a beat as they feed a new sword into their leading hand and leap over their gleaming barrier, back arching and body generating even more power for a diagonal, downward finisher.	Control-7, Power-7, Reserves-6Samidare (Early Summer Rain)The ultimate in blade summoning at a pinch, the adept will cast a handful of specially prepared needles in front of them -- duplicates imbued with the same chakra signatures of the embedded, scented variety -- to call their corresponding weapons from the armoury in a mass instantaneous replacement technique. This can only be used once per thread.Yaiba no Shouheki (Blade Barrier)In defence of an attack or as a means of maintaining cover while advancing, the user draws their full complement of swords inwards to form a bell-shaped ring around them. Circling the user at high speed, the chakra-infused barrier is able to repel both ninjutsu and taijutsu attacks, but will slow the user to a stop.Base: Lasts 1 post; will repel Stage 2 Ninjutsu and Stage 3 Taijutsu attacks.Stage 4: Lasts 2 posts; will repel Stage 3 Ninjutsu and Stage 4 Taijutsu attacks; user can move at half their normal speed.Stage 5: Will repel Stage 4 Ninjutsu and Stage 5 Taijutsu; user can move normally.	0	9	11	0	0	0	0	8	0
892	4	4	Divine Swords of the Wind	Kaze no Shinken	Control Range: 4.5m radial sphere (9m diameter)Focus: Now considered something of a tactician, the user possesses a heightened awareness of their swords' positioning while using their eidetic sensory memories in new ways to visualise and act upon the noted movements of nearby enemies. Consequently, formal training against up to two additional foes can now begin properly, although the mind has not yet been conditioned to the point where it can balance these two inputs effortlessly, so the user's overall focus may be somewhat diminished while attempting this feat.Movement: As the strain of maintaining one's Shinken reduces, more effort can be put into the purely physical aspects of the style, such as running speed, acrobatic elevation and manual dexterity. The precision, acceleration and opportunities gained by the user's short sprints within their control sphere also improve, and they can now use this skill to cross distances between foes or to snatch a blade from its flight path. It is at this point that the Shinken begins to take on the appearance of a mirage of slowed or frozen time, and the user's body an undulation of sand on the cusp of a storm front.Unarmed: Drawing on the mostly instinctive patterns of their existing kata, the user will learn to deliver quick kicks to the enemy's legs, as well as jabs, uppercuts and open-handed palm strikes to the upper body and head. These are primarily used as tactical options to disorient and take advantage of a situation by means of a planned combination; they still lack the power of finishers. The user does, however, possess the defensive capacity to diminish the blunt-force power of incoming finishers against those of a similar level, either by drawing in limbs to absorb body blows, or hopping into whirling deflections.Shinken: The user is now quick enough to slip the flat of an aerial blade between them and their opponent at the last minute to break the force of a strike. Furthermore, an improved mechanical efficiency is now evident in every motion, permitting less obvious overtures for airborne attacks and allowing the swordsman's aerial weapons to perform different movements from those in their hands. Attacks become less predictable as feints and parries with one set can now be combined with thrusts or sweeps using the other.Cradle: Whether arranged in small bunches of blades or scattering swords evenly in a semicircle, the cradle can now revolve as a single unit, either opening up or obstructing the space between the swordsman and their opponents. This movement is swift, matching the increased speed at which users can cycle their weapons through the cradle to fall into place before they are needed, with reserves held in a handful of other trusty locations should their strategy fail. This creates new pathways of possible strikes through the battlefield.Swordsmanship: As greater combat opportunities reveal themselves, the user's personal flair with weapon-based and open-handed technique combinations will also appear. For instance, they might sprint unarmed towards their opponent and leap into range to deliver a strong feint with their right, but then switch a sword into their left so that they can perform a high velocity slice at close range instead. This will also lead to improved ease in transitions between weapon schools, aided further by being able to use a flight of aerial blades to distract the opponent or screen their actions from view.Dual Wielding School: Sword Skills of the Mind Weaponry: Large sword (primary), medium sword (secondary). Dove Stance II (Attack): With the body's profile kept to a minimum, feet are drawn slightly closer, resulting in a more acute angle to the en-garde position and a more balanced distribution of weight. Shoulders rise as arms are drawn in, bending to create a closer guard, with elbows in line with the bottom of the ribcage and knuckles in line with the nose. The user's blades descend from each fist like fangs, held in the reverse grip. Guard Stance II: Opening their profile slightly, both knees will now face forward, allowing the user to sink into a more stable and powerful position, while their elbow rise so that their forearms make a lateral screen in front of their chin, the blades in each hand's reverse grip pointing forwards to the left and right like the waiting maw of the ant-lion. Bladework: Up until this point, the user has aimed to whittle away at the enemy's stamina with rapid fencing cuts, deft dodges and precise finishers. They now seek to accelerate this process, stepping in close to deliver more punishing strikes that use the entirety of their weapons, experimenting with guard bashes, pommel jabs and even crossed hilt blocks. Spinning their swords between grips quickly with the aid of Shinken, the student will be able to use their heightened agility and newfound understanding of key muscle groups to pepper their opponent with both dull and sharp strikes in coordinated patterns. While one sword might perform a clockwise Dove Cut from above, the other will finish the cycle from below; the most significant accomplishment is that the user has progressed beyond the need for a primary and a second weapon. Although this does make their movements more difficult to predict, using one's blades together in this way, for the first time, can lead to more symmetrical attack patterns.Two-Handed School: Sword of No Mind Weaponry: Large blade (two-handed or one-handed) Eagle Stance II (Attack): Drawing one's weight back into a more balanced distribution, the front foot is favoured only slightly as the bend in the knees increases. The sword is held in a more centred position, hands clasped around the hilt in front of the waist, and blade rising to occupy the space between combattants. Guard Stance: None. Bladework: Rising, descending and lateral strikes can now be combined in swift succession with little loss of power in between due to improving dexterity and the reinforcement derived from Shinken. Unlike the initial stance, body and blade must now move at the same time in order to generate the same force, turning the wrists to affect Eagle Strikes from a neutral standing position. This can not only be accomplished more quickly, but with additional reach as the user begins to alternate between two-handed and single-handed attacks. This improved efficiency gives the student more time to think, helping them to devise a more extensive strategy to triumph in challenging situations. Yet conversely, the student is also slipping into a clearer mentality, guided by their meditation to expel distractions and trust in the power of their nose and in their control of Shinken. Freeing up their thought processes, the adept enters into the state of 'No Mind' and begins to test the limits of this newfound battle sense. Their cradle will start to respond to their intent unbidden, seemingly preempting the user's movements and allowing them to juggle up to three large swords. Techniques like Heaven's Discord will be deployed frequently to break the enemy's momentum and feed their own.	d	4	5	Regular Technique: Ten no Hanron (Heaven's Rebuttal) While in Dove Stance II, the user deflects an attack to the side using a strong hilt or blade strike of their own, immediately stepping closer to jab the pommel of their second sword into the inner shoulder of the enemy's thrown arm, following up with the first sword as soon as it returns. This pressures the opponent to protect the joint by turning their body. However, the safety from harm afforded by such measure is an illusion, as a pulling motion from the user will then draw spare swords towards the exploited shoulder as a distraction, allowing the swordsman to slip into a new position. This serves as the perfect opportunity to discard their dual blades for a single sword and shift stances while the enemy is otherwise occupied. Regular Technique: Shisha no Senku-sha (Emissary's Vanguard) In order to throw their opponent off balance before advancing, the user will swipe one sword horizontally in a feint that will instead send a trio of airborne blades in a larger sweep, like the tails of a whip. Cutting through the opponent's upper space, the user will aim to force them to evade or block, exposing them to a subsequent trio of descending blades conducted with a smaller swipe of their other sword. Regular Technique: Ten no Sagi (Heaven's Deceit) Commencing with a powerful step in and a strong two-handed slash that aims to throw the opponent from their own centre line, either through evasion or parrying, the user will immediately switch to a series of three one-handed lateral strikes, reinforced by Shinken to be delivered with the same force as both hands, and pressing forward with each cross of the blade. Each time their sword arm moves, their open hand matches it in reverse underneath until the fourth strike, where it will silently pull a second blade from the cradle, transitioning instantly into the school's dual wielding approach and doubling the user's ongoing barrage. Regular Technique: Shisha no Shomei (Emissary's Illumination) While already engaged in combat, the user will serve up a feint with their handheld sword, calling for a single suspended blade (large or oversized) to scythe in at shin height. However, landing an attack of this calibre is only usually successful against much weaker opponents, so at this level of fighting it serves a dual purpose. Leaping at the same time as their opponent as if to evade as well, the user will stop the sword's flight short just below them to use the blade as a springboard. With their Shinken now strong enough to support their weight, albeit briefly, the user can cartwheel over their opponent, then rebound off a new blade held higher to deliver a diving, full-powered thrust.	Control-10, Power-10, Reserves-8Shinkyou (Holy Mirror)Requires: 2 oversized swordsFirst layering blade over blade then entwining their individual scent ribbons into a single cord, the user floods the combined objects with chakra for a unique clan henge that produces a solid, oversized sword of monstrous proportions. This item will endure for 2 posts (including creation), possessing a single hilt and appearing as up to twice the length and thrice the width of the largest sword, perfect for both striking and defending. Its weight is consistent with that of the originals but, using Shinken for strengthening, can be wreak destruction with relative ease. As the form that each Shinkyou takes is said to be a reflection of the user's soul, its various designs should be described in the 'other' section of the character's sheet.Base: The user is only able to wield the sword manually.Stage 5: The user can merge 3 oversize swords, further increasing defensive potential and striking power.Stage 6: The user can wield the sword through Shinken alone.Kenshutsu: Yomitoru (Detection School: Read)Base: Combining the auras of both an opponent's equipment and natural musk, the user can identify their complete silhouette for a handful of seconds to determine their exact location and posture within range unless obstructed.Stage 5: The user's sensory abilities can circumvent all obstructions except those which form a complete enclosure.Stage 6: The user can form a detailed picture of opponents with their mind's eye, 'seeing' clearly from all angles with innate depth perception to track every movement within range, however minute. This effect lasts for two posts.	13	14	16	0	0	0	0	14	0
892	5	5	Divine Swords of the Wind	Kaze no Shinken	Control Range: 6m radial sphere (12m diameter)Focus: Different layers of spatial awareness, be it of their cradle, enemies or terrain, will be compiled into a strategic resource at the user's beck and call. Removed from the majority of battlefield distractions, the guardian of 'no mind' will find further liberation in the range of tactical gambits open to them. Cycling through these and able to employ a number simultaneously to engage up to four additional foes, the user's decision-making now operates on a near-subconscious level.Movement: The user has developed their muscles' activation times and mechanical fluidity to generate even more power and speed through fewer motions. With less telegraphing, the path through battle now resolves into one of steps, shuffles, leaps, bounds, burst sprints, spinning and snap kicks, butterfly twists, and aerial side-saults. The practitioner will notice an improved sense of balance, aiding footwork and relaxing unnecessary tension in the body, also allowing them to more precisely direct their blades in any situation, even in the absence of suitable footholds or if forced to stand on a single leg or They are also able to fight more competently in adverse conditions, such as reduced footholds that might limit the user to standing on a single leg.Unarmed: Actions will now stem from a more neutral and unpredictable stance, matching the reduced tension present in the user's sword forms. Taking another leaf from these schools, one will begin to intersperse blade-work with longer hand-to-hand combinations if suitable. Arm movements flicker at a speed that matches their swordplay, whether attacking with the gouging finger, the hammer-like heel of the hand or the jutting elbow. Beyond this stage, there is little more to be taught.Shiken: Airborne attacks now connect with the full precision of manual ones, but can be delivered at much sharper, normally impossible angles and trajectories, including circular spins and jigsaw jousts (rolling combinations of thrusts and lateral slices). Swords will therefore gain new roles, capable of feats beyond the limitations of the human hand. For instance, when within a metre of one of their swords, the user can inject their chakra through other trails emanating from its scented needle and send them into the ground as a means of controlled suspension so that they (and only they) can use their weapons as static surfaces from which to rebound.Cradle: The armoury has expanded to form a full half shell that can curve overhead and to either side, fully blocking off all blind spots, or shifting subtly to create a path through the blades of the user's design. This is often used to trap unwary foes who believe they have found safe passage through the minefield. Little energy is expended in coordinating the multiplicity of pieces and even less in moving them to their desired location. Now they simply seem to appear in the user's hand as if unbidden.Swordsmanship: The line between sword schools begins to blur as the singular combat focus of 'No Mind' begins to seep across the divide during transitions, imbuing their Sword Skills with a similar clarity of intent and movement. Switches grow more frequent and more fluid, now a vital part of one's strategy and drawing on the user's full complement of swords.Dual Wielding School: Sword Skills of the Mind Weaponry: Large sword (primary), large sword (secondary). Dove Stance III (Attack): A seemingly simple stance, the user entices their opponents into range by closing the gap between their feet, placing weight on their front leg and lifting their rear heel from the ground, while lowering their arms to either side, blades held low, open, inviting, posture relaxed yet prepared, bold, assured. Guard stances can be raised against stronger foes but the user generally has less need for them now. Bladework: By this point, tireless training, study and practice in different complex battle situations and simulations has developed a keen awareness of the body's weak spots and how to land blows in these zones against multiple opponents using both their sword hands and aerial arsenal. Picking targets with a discerning eye and exploiting injuries wherever possible, the user's weapons now beat and cut with the speed and finesse of a hummingbird, using all parts of the wing with equal skill. Gone are the symmetrical tendencies, and even with a large sword in one hand and a medium sword in the other, gone too are all traces of a dominant and subordinate arm. The user's body now dances through combat, movements light and sharp, body flexible and lithe, their balance much improved too. Rather than stepping aside to evade, the adept will now step into or under many incoming attacks for a swifter, cleaner riposte, which might be a pommel strike to the temple, a sharp kick to the side of the knee or a heavy cut to the torso.Two-Handed School: Sword of No Mind Weaponry: Oversized (two-handed) or large (one-handed) sword. Eagle Stance III (Attack): Bolder still than the Dove, and fiercer than any bird of prey, the user raises their sword above their head, hilt tilted directly over their crown to create an upward, diagonal line with the blade. With elbows raised level with the forehead, the front of the body is left open to attack. Only those confident in their swordsmanship and survival skills would dare to approach such a blatant challenge; the user's confidence is now well founded. Bladework: Increases in both physical strength and Shinken proficiency have created an incredibly dexterous swordsman, to whom the wielding of large swords using one hand is commonplace, and the introduction of oversized blades in a two-handed grip is merely a natural, anticipated progression. Juggling up to five swords and flitting through stances like an eagle selecting wind currents to ride, the user reaps savage and unpredictable destruction wherever they charge. Attacks can now be made from all angles, heights and points of contact with the ground, and initiated by either the sword or the body. Furthermore, the adept will experience improved acceleration and deceleration, initiating charges or interrupting them to control the pace of combat.	d	4	5	Regular Technique: Haruichiban (First Storm of Spring) Stepping in, the user performs a double set of uppercuts to the chin using the hilt of their swords, before spinning the blades to snap the flat of their steel against either side of the opponent's head to further disorient. With a half step back and a turn of the wrists, these broad surfaces then descend to trap a limb of the user's choice with a numbing snap before twisting to slice at the tendons and muscles underneath as the user retreats. Regular Technique: Shisha no Hakachi (Emissary's Graveyard) Sending their armoury rocketing skyward, the practitioner holds their swords menacingly overhead, pointing down like a cave of stalactites. At their command, they will release them to fall naturally but, aware of their trajectories, will be able to plot a course between them as they descend into range, darting forward only to disappear behind a diagonal veil of steel that leads around behind their opponent. By the time all have landed, sticking from the ground like a field of grave markers, the user will have struck from behind in an attempt to add their opponent to the list of the dead. Regular Technique: Zekken (Absolute Blade) The adept gathers four swords behind them in a revolving X-shape as they adopt Eagle Stance III before charging. These five blades comprise their immediate arsenal, each weapon weaving in a choreographed pattern around the user to complement their movements, however extreme the latter. Once drawn from their twisting, multi-directional orbit to strike once, they are returned to the fold, from where they can be drawn again in a juggling act that can be maintained until the user's momentum is broken. Regular Technique: Shisha no Shougeki (Emissary's Bombardment) Charging the enemy, the user embarks on a chain of one-handed strikes, stepping under, leaping over or simply weaving through the path of each blade, like an advanced form of Heaven's Discord. However, here, the finisher is replaced by a feint, drawing the leading hand from behind the body as if collecting a sword to land the final blow, but rising even quicker and using their trailing arm to deliver a crushing fist to the chest. This sudden change of strategy is used to surprise and disorient, and open a window through which the real blade can then deliver its judgment.	Control-15, Power-15, Reserves-13Genzou no Tama (Phantom Shot)Requires: TobutoriThis super-speed jutsu is activated through a timely combination of shinken and swordsmanship to cross distances mid-combo and even mid-air. Unlike the Flying Bird, the Phantom Shot is launched by the user, a sword thrown by hand along a direct line of sight from origin to target destination. At the same time, the user flushes their own scent aura with chakra to create a ghostly afterimage. This glimmering glamour remains in their wake for a second while their Shinken connection carries them behind their sword without losing power. However, the speed at which the user will travel to reach the edge of their control sphere is so great (raised 2 levels above normal) that they must leave their cradle in situ behind them until they have come to a stop, with any blades left at the opposite edge of the initial sphere falling out of play entirely. Should the adept wield only a single blade at the time, they will not be limited by this spatial requirement and can travel up to 50 metres in any direction as long as they have a clear line of sight. As the technique's speed is drawn from the user's physical strength and spiritual stamina, they will serve a single recovery post during which their Strength and Stamina levels are both reduced by one.Kouken no Kenbou (Guardian's Gambit)Requires: Yaiba no ShouhekiDrawing together a protective pentagon of five medium to large blades, the user spins them around their outstretched hand. This, at first, forms a rather large aperture, exposing most of the Kaihoukan's body and enticing their opponent to attack. Each revolution will draw the hilts closer together, closing the gap and forcing the enemy to act before losing their advantage. As soon as the user detects such an attempt, they will ready their chakra coils, closing their fist at the precise moment that the blow lands. If timed correctly, this combines their blades in a concealing flash of light to create a 'shield blade', capable of perfectly reflecting this one instance of up to Stage 5 Ninjutsu or Taijutsu. Afterwards, it loses its special quality but can be maintained for a further post to act as a standard, edged shield. The object will typically appear as a much shorter and broader version of the user's Shinkyou, but some Kaihoukan have been known to will new designs into existence too.	16	19	21	0	0	0	0	16	0
892	6	6	Divine Swords of the Wind	Kaze no Shinken	Control Range: 6m radial sphere (12m diameter)Focus: Such is the clarity of the user's thought and deed that they move without hesitation and strike without remorse. They are now intuitively aware of the individuals moving through their control range and can interpret feedback from their Shinken to gather information from every conflict involving their blades. This allows them to better understand their opponents, even if half a dozen choose to engage the Kaihoukan adept in force, and provide the necessary insights to better predict the origin and manner of any inbound attacks as the conflict progresses.Movement: All actions to evade and advance are now instinctive, while the user's body positioning and balance have developed to the point where they will use all levels to their advantage, whether fighting from the ground, in a crouch or atop a floating blade.Unarmed: Having already reached the end of their formal education, the student is left to focus on cleaning up their form to remove waste energy and improving their power, speed and response times.Shiken: The user is now taking full advantage of their Shinken, readily walking the line between aerial and manual dexterity. Now, the adept's fingers will barely need to grip their hilt, using their Shinken instead to push their bladework into an almost inhuman realm of unorthodox directions backed by tremendous torque. Aerial blades can otherwise be commanded using only the slightest of impulses from the hands and fingers, as if at the behest of a master puppeteer. Shinken strikes made with large and oversized blades will also carry enough force to change the trajectory of the user's own body in mid-air should they catch the sword while it is in motion. This has the potential to turn the tide of battle. While in physical contact with their sword, the user can then alter the item's other scent trails, anchoring them against the ground to use as weaponised moving platforms. These can be mounted by the user for up to ten seconds at a time or used as temporary springboards, drawn into formation around an enemy to set up an omni-directional air strike combination.Cradle: The user's armoury will now encircle the whole battlefield, a bubble of blades that can either expand to surround any opponents caught within the control sphere or shrink to encase its owner in a sharp, seething exterior. Swords can be drawn from any point in this configuration, adjusting their own angle and position to perfectly match that required by the user's waiting hand. Whether appearing from behind their owner or the opponent, rocketing into their grasp from overhead or underneath, or subtly detaching from another swirling front of biting edges sent in different direction altogether, the swords afford the user the chance to affect a range of motion that will cause minimal strain on the muscles and tendons of an already highly efficient vessel.Swordsmanship: At this penultimate stage, the user is considered to have attained the pinnacle of their swordsmanship. Though their cradle has not yet reached perfection, transitions occur between the two sword schools with such frequency and effortless grace that the divide nearly ceases to exist. Armed with the now piercing focus of 'No Mind', they can look past distractions to fully engage with the flow of battle, their mind's eye drawing on recorded observations and scents to see beyond the immediate intent of their opponents, preempting movement and guiding their steel towards the very heart of their target. Attack patterns now manifest as an expertly designed dance of destruction using swords both large and small in single-, two- and dual-handed combinations, the user's body flitting between opponents like a furious djinn riding the four winds.Dual Wielding School: Sword Skills of the Mind Weaponry: Oversize sword (primary), large sword (secondary).Former Two-Handed School: Sword of No Mind Weaponry: Oversized (one-handed).	d	4	5	Regular Technique: Tengoku no Fuusha (Heavenly Windmill) Skipping into an elongated, spinning aerial, the user leaps over their opponent, collecting scent strings like actual cords by wrapping them across their fingers, wrists, elbows and shoulders. Upon landing, they become a dervish of speed, continuing to rotate through the sheer velocity and intricacy of their footwork, and weaving across the terrain towards or between their foe(s). All the while, the swords they have amassed swing in a multi-bladed disk of spinning steel, each string retracted and released through the movements and tilts of their upper body to pull the swords in closer or lengthen their leash and obfuscate their true targets. They are the reaping whirlwind. Regular Technique: Amahagane (Heavenly Steel) The heart of Shinken has always been revealed in the moments when it defies the possible, undoing reason and revelling in its ability to bend or break the physical constraints of the natural world. Here, its unnatural powers completely shatter those laws. With anything up to an oversized sword held aloft in the palm of one hand, the user's Shinken commands the weapon to begin twisting around its lengthy axis until its revolutions match that of a mechanical drill. The sword's speed is such that it could burrow into stone as easily as mud, making any attempt at parrying its dizzyingly-fast strikes incredibly difficult. Only a master's eye could hope to anticipate the speed, force and angle of its impacting edge, particularly as this regular technique is used primarily to augment the Kaihoukan's existing level of sword craft. At this stage, only one drill can be wielded in the Eagle Stance, but a master of the style would bear no such restrictions, and could easily add this technique to their dual-wielding repertoire as well.	Control-19, Power-19, Reserves-18Saijikisha no Enbu (Waltz of the Devourer)The user first gathers twelve blades about their kinesphere like an advanced Zekken -- four behind, two above, two to either side and the final two in their hands. This time, in Dove Stance III, they begin their deadly charge by skipping into their first rotation, moving through each successive strike in every imaginable direction with a masterful display of manual dexterity, clean, aerial precision and nimble footwork. While they narrow their intent upon a single target, their cradle surrounds this immediate engagement in a spinning ring of protective steel. These swords rise, fall, joust and cut, choreographed to counter attempts by other opponents to interfere. If fighting one-on-one, these blades form a semicircle behind the opponent to apply pressure and create or exploit openings. If their advance is rebuffed, the user will recall their dance partners to recuperate behind a slowly revolving, close-knit sphere for 1 post. If, however, they are successful and weaken their opponent with a critical blow, they will call their Armoury to converge on their target from all directions from which the only means of escape is up.Siyaku no Busou (Arms of Calamity)Requires: Shinkyou ; 30 points in the active Armoury.The user recalls all Shinken cords to wind around his outstretched arm at high velocity, creating a cylindrical barrier and scope, through which he targets his adversary. The chakra threads will weave and coil themselves in thick bands across his arms and upper body like a divine layer of sinew, culminating in a grand Shinkyou as the collected swords converge upon each other in the user's other hand. Measuring up to x4 the length and width of the user's longest and widest blades, the gargantuan weapon can withstand up to two Stage 6 special taijutsu attacks and one Stage 6 ninjutsu strike. It is also sturdy enough to withstand all regular attacks except for those with special cutting properties. While adorned by the 'god flesh' and wielding the Calamity Blade for the 2 post duration of the technique, the user's Strength rating will further be raised one level. When the technique ends, this stat will then fall by one and the user's Armoury dwindle for 22 points for 2 recovery posts. The character's Calamity Blade must be described in the 'other' section of their sheet.	21	26	28	0	0	0	12	24	0
892	7	7	Divine Swords of the Wind	Kaze no Shinken	Control Range: 7.5m radial sphere (15m diameter)The master now has the potential to dominate their personalised battlefield before an opponent draws near, reading vibrational feedback from their blades and Shinken lines to discern vaster volumes of combat-oriented information and using these observations to better inform their strategies. Only foes whose martial mandates promote cool heads and even forms will be immune to this initial layer of awareness, but will still find themselves caught between a rock and sharp place when faced with the swordsman themselves.Piercing through all distractions, the user will always visualise their battle taking place several steps in advance and but delegate their cradle's weaponry accordingly to account for most deviations from the plan, even when faced by the multiple eventualities presented by a dozen foes. All is where it should be for the cunning architect of other people's demise, with an abstract cradle that is only limited by the bounds of the imagination: one moment a cyclonic storm front or solemn sword graveyard, and the next a steep, interlocking ramp or sheer-walled tunnel.With no joule of wasted energy, nor moment of misspent movement, the master's body is at once flowing, sharp, sleight, momentous and sublime, matching the clean motions of their blades pound for pound, and sweeping across the terrain with flourish and finesse. Manoeuvres are performed so slickly and quickly that the user becomes but a blur between blades. Furthermore, tireless training has elevated unarmed offense and defense to the point where they should now be able to hold their own against those of another style and similar level, albeit only briefly. Their close-quarters form is characterised by both wide and narrow light-footed stances that can release the snap of a foot like lightning to perform ground-based and leaping kicks, as well as strong, fluid arm patterns that can switch from the dizzying revolutions of circular blocks to dispense whirling chops, straight punches and aggressive jab combinations.Nonetheless, it is their seamless and ferocious bladework that bestows upon Kaze no Shinken masters the bearings of true greatness. More than just a force of nature, their complex combinations using the all-encompassing embrace of Shinken reflects their status as living weapons. Swords move without instruction, attuned to the user's will and ingenuity, acting as a seemingly independent strike force at the behest of their lord commander. Frankly, at this point, it is not the prerogative of words to do this great art justice, but the master's prowess with the sword, which must be survived to be believed.	d	4	5		Control-26, Power-25, Reserves-24Arahitogami no Koutetsu (Armour of the Living God)Requires: Kenshutsu: Yomitoru ; 36 points in the active Armoury.Sending all but one of their active blades into a vortex at the edge of their control sphere, the user thrusts their last sword into the ground, part altar, part key to cancel the technique if in danger. With each revolution, the weapons' scent trails lengthen into silken chakra threads, yet leave the user unarmed for the entirety of the post, unable to summon more. In the next post, the user will recall their blades to converge on their centre point and forcibly removing their scented needles at the last moment. The weapons furrow into the nearby terrain like the chaotic falling leaves of Autumn, season of Calamity, while the needles, now bearing vast lengths of invisible thread, proceed to weave a glamour of chakra about the Kaihoukan's body, even as they move to summon the rest of their weapons or to evade further attacks. Wind-element augmentation gives the garb shape, substance and colour, forming a magnificent suit of perfumed armour covering the entire body save the nostrils (detailed in the 'other' section of the character sheet). This protective layer will remain for a further two posts, fending off all but a Stage 7 special technique, which would instantly dispel the glamour. Wearing the chakra armour permits normal levels of mobility and swordsmanship with the remaining Armoury weapons, although these will remain a constant 6 points for the rest of the thread. Due to the 'solid' nature of the suit, the user's eyes will be blinded, forcing them to rely on the techniques of the Kenshutsu school to navigate the field of battle.Kaze no Shinkouken (Divine Guardian of the Wind)Requires: Shinkyou ; 42 points in the active Armoury.Dividing their completed Armoury in two and cording all scent trails into a pair of reins, the user merges their weapons into twin Shinkyou and begins to spin them like heavy flails for their first post. Blazing across the terrain in a display of dazzling footwork to evade incoming attacks and respond or preempt with a few of their own, their weapons will rip through the air like an evolution of the Heavenly Windmill technique. In their second post, the Guardian gains additional speed (1 level) by channeling chakra through their own scent emissions to perform a final Shinken upon themselves and tether their bodies to the centre of their control range. They will guard this ground with their very lives. The user now has complete, omni-directional mobility within this spherical zone for the rest of their post, able to take their awesome display of culling prowess to the sky as if dancing on air, undaunted by the laws of physics. Upon completing the technique, however, the user will find themselves temporarily disoriented by the rotations, suffering the loss of one level in both Stamina and Speed ratings for their recovery post, during which time their Armoury is reduced to 10 points, rising to 20 in the next for the remainder of the thread.	32	33	34	0	0	0	15	29	0
891	1	1	Flowers of a Hundred Years	Hyakunen no Hana	At this point, the bloodline expresses itself at a step of training just above the very basic manifestation of the ability, allowing the possessor to cover as much (or little) of their body with the senbon-sized needles as they wish in an instant. The spines cause the user no pain or difficulty in movement and immediately augment their offensive and defensive capabilities, making the user someone an opponent would be hesitant to strike with a bare hand or kick while also allowing the user's every strike that much deadlier due to the penetration offered by the needles.In addition, the Hyakunen no Hana user can launch just short of a dozen needles at a time (per post) with little more than a directed gesture of their hands or feet, sending the burst of needles flying at a speed and range equivalent to that they would achieve if they had thrown them by hand.The hand-to-hand aspect of the style at this point is rather unsophisticated, the user being told to focus on making smart strikes and using the advantage the needles are to their advantage, but the strikes are still somewhat sloppy and poorly aimed compared to what will come further in the style.	2	5	2	Nakkuru (Knuckles) - This technique is one of the simplest implementations of the bloodline, allowing the user to grow shorter, but thicker needles, just over a quarter of an inch in diameter at the widest point and three inches in length, on each of the four primary knuckles on each hand. This augments whatever closed-fist punches the user may land in the obvious ways, making every punch a chance to land a vital blow. This ability actually applies to more areas than just the knuckles on your hand; the user may also choose to sprout a spike on each elbow and knee, these being about five inches in length and about an inch in diameter at the widest point, or on the feet if the user so wishes and thinks it may make their kicks more effective.	Hahen (Splinter) [[Requirements: Control 2, Power 2]] -While Hyakunen no Hana will ultimately focus on delivering precisely place and damaging needles throughout the style, Hahen is born out of the philosophy that, sometimes, you really just want to confuse and inconvenience an opponent rather than turn them into a pincushion. Hahen works by causing any number of airborne needles to immediately split into two or, occasionally, more pieces the size of sewing needles or even smaller, similar to the size of sewing pins one would use to hold together. This technique vastly decreases the lethality of the original needles but, given the sheer quantity and shock of what happens right before your eyes, it can disorient, confuse, and misdirect an opponent, buying the user time to escape, gain a better position, or set the opponent up for a follow-up.Sensaku Suru I (To Pry I) [[Requirement: Control 2, Power 2]] -An extension of the same ability that allows the user to widen the needles in their own body to make them more fearsome in hand-to-hand situations, Sasaku Suru instead focuses on doing much the same to the needles the user has managed to get lodged into their opponent, increasing their diameter roughly three times, making any such needles suddenly much more harmful.	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
891	2	2	Flowers of a Hundred Years	Hyakunen no Hana	At this point in training, the user has begun real training in learning to pick the best targets of their strikes in both ranged and hand-to-hand applications. In addition, the ability to fire needles at will has increased at this point, allowing the user to launch as many as two dozen needles per turn in two directed strikes; this means, essentially, the user my direct two separate bursts of a at most a dozen needles per turn or one burst of two dozen needles.	2	5	2	Iwa o Bunkatsu (Break the Rock) -Iwa o Bunkatsu is a category most strikes of the user of Hyakunen no Hana will fall into, aiming for the most obvious and easiest to hit joints: shoulders, knees, and hips. There are other joints, of course, but they take a bit more finesse to hit in the thick of things than it takes to get a quick strike to a shoulder to land just right. This applies beyond hand-to-hand strikes, of course, applying to their throws, aiming to fill their target's vulnerable points with needles in both modes of attack.	Suna no Youkai (Specter of the Sands) [[Requirements: Control 4, Power 4]] -Sometimes, a target may attempt to hide behind a wall or a shield or even another person. This can be quite troublesome unless you have access to something like Suna no Youkai in your arsenal, allowing you to very briefly make as many as a dozen projectiles at once able to pass through mundane inanimate matter up to six inches thick, making that thick armor or even a standard wall far less useful of barrier between the user and their target.Josho Hari (Rising Nail) [[Requirements: Control 4, Power 4]] -Throwing their hands flat onto the ground with force, the user puts about a dozen needles into the ground. The needles will continue to move under the ground, allowing the user to make them emerge from the ground at any point desired with the same force as if they had been thrown. The needles cannot be directed or controlled once they break the surface, but by then, most of the work has been done.	0	8	6	0	0	0	0	6	0
891	3	3	Flowers of a Hundred Years	Hyakunen no Hana	This stage is a sheer improvement on everything in the style so far. The user is now capable of shooting twice the number of needles as in the previous stages (about three dozen at this point) divided in any number of directing gestures as they may wish in one post; for example, one gesture may cause up to the entire entire that may be launched to go, or it may cause as few as half a dozen to be sent through the air. This offers the Hyakunen no Hana adept a number of options not previously available.In addition, the overall strategy of using the style has opened up in new ways both inside and outside of combat. With the addition of the special technique 'Hari no Ana' to their arsenal, the adept can make use of their needles to do reconnaissance and surveillance. In addition, taking lessons from the different varieties of cactus and different animals within the desert, they have learned to further the basic 'Nakkuru' technique into the 'Anaguma no Tsume' technique, making them even more fearsome in close quarters than before.	2	5	2	Anaguma no Tsume (Claws of the Badger) -Building on the Nakkuru technique from the beginning of the style, at this point, the user has experimented enough with the same principles to be able to make the spines different shapes and lengths; namely, they may choose to grow much longer and relatively flatter spines from any place they would have previously been able to grow the reinforced spikes, mimicking the needle habit of the so called paper-skinned cactus. In practice, these spikes serve more as blades than simply piercing weapons. Having the ability to grow tanto-sized blades (approximately six inches in exposed length) from the spaces between your knuckles or on your feet, elbows, or knees is self-explanatory in how they might augment your attacks. It should be noted that it is not suggested that one try and engage in clashing these spikes against an actual bladed weapon; while the spines themselves may endure the meeting, the same may not be true for the flesh surrounding the spines, possibly leading to extremely damaging injuries.	Nezuku (Take Root) [[Requirements: Control 7, Power 7, Reserves 6, Clan GM Permission]] -Nezuku is the first of the three techniques unlocking the power of the needles themselves. The needles produced by possessors of this bloodline have grown accustomed to the vital energies of their hosts. While in the user's body, they are in a state of comfort and satisfaction; after they have been separated from their original host, however, the needles desire to return to such a state. As the saying goes, 'Seikatsu wa jinsei o motomete'-that is, the living seek life. And, in the tradition of desperate, hardy existence in the desert, the needles seek to hold themselves with an unmatched tenacity. By making a half hand-seal and speaking this command-even as quietly as a whisper-the needles take heed of their originator's command and begin to take root in the target they have been stuck in, reaching out to any other needles within an a few inches with thin roots just beneath the epidermis, seeking to make a network with the other needles so as to be more difficult to remove. This process takes very little time, the roots growing and, if applicable, connecting to any other nearby root systems from the needles within the same post as they are commanded to take root. Needless to say, this is an incredibly uncomfortable and, plainly, painful process. The user and opponent must be within ten meters of each other for this technique to be initiated. Note that these must be full needles released from the user, not the shards or splinters that may be caused by other techniques.Hari Bakudan (Needle Bomb) [[Requirements: Control 7, Power 7, Reserves 6]] -With this technique, the user can cause a single needle to explode with the force of an explosive note. An additional effect of this technique is that, when the needle in question explodes, it splinters into about half a dozen additional needles. Note that these needles are specially designated when they leave the body of the user by possessing a glowing red color.Hari no Ana (The eye of a needle) [[Requirements: Control 7, Power 7, Reserves 6]] -A utilitarian use of the style, this technique allows the user to throw a needle into an object and use it as a method of remote viewing. The user can, in fact, establish four of these at one time, allowing them to cycle through the different views offered at will.	0	12	8	0	0	0	0	8	0
891	4	4	Flowers of a Hundred Years	Hyakunen no Hana	The step from adept to disciple is quite the step for the possessor of Hyakunen no Hana. Again, the number increases, reaching a quantity near fifty capable of being launched in a single post. They cannot typically be released in any fewer than two bursts of about two dozen needles each, still requiring gestures to direct their direction and trajectory, but even with these limits, the sheer volume of needles is reaching a point that is ludicrous.The overall striking emphasis has continued to be built in the same direction: purposeful, targeted hits meant to inflict the maximum amount of damage in the most efficient way possible.	2	5	2	Harisenbon (1,000 Needles) -Just because you have to use two separate gestures for the bursts doesn't mean you cannot direct the needles towards the same target. Using a quick one-two gesture (or, as later stages will allow, four or more gestures in quick succession) with the hands, the user will launch all the needles they can in one post with such a time gap that it is hardly perceivable. While the title is technically an overstatement at this point, most would rather think about how to defend or avoid such an assault than argue the accuracy of the name.	Sabaku no Raiu (Desert Thunderstorm) [[Requirements: Control 10, Power 10, Reserves 8]] -The user releases a single charged needle towards a target at a ridiculous speed, possessing velocity enough that it could overcome practically any mundane armor if it were to strike. However, this needle will never actually impact the target, detonating just short of the perceived target and pushing the needle past the speed of sound for just a split second before it is undone by the shockwave released, disappearing into a negligible cloud of dust and almost certainly knocking those within a radius of about ten feet to the ground. Further, the shockwave can cause a temporary loss of hearing (lasting two posts) and, occasionally, causes nausea and, more often, disorientation.Hari no Nedoko (Bed of Nails) [[Requirements: Control 10, Power 10, Reserves 8]] -Using a similar tactic as a previous technique, Josho Hari, the user slamming their hands down upon the ground beneath them. Unlike in Josho Hari, however, the sheer amount of needles is much, much larger. Also unlike that technique is the intent. The purpose is not to make to catch a target by surprise with the equivalent of one throw of needles, but to create a field about the user that is safe only for them, essentially creating a field with a radius of 10 meters meters around them where any step made by an opponent can be expected to be met with needles rising out of the ground into their feet. The field does not react in this way to the user and, in fact, they may suppress it in sections, potentially allowing them to trap a target within the field unless they either just decide to brave the needles or have alternative methods of getting out of that position.	13	15	15	0	0	0	0	14	0
891	5	5	Flowers of a Hundred Years	Hyakunen no Hana	Here is where things start getting serious. First, the number of needles about to be released at this point is approaching ridiculous even if the pace of increase is slowing down; at a certain point, however, there are only so many needles that can be released at one time. The number of needles able to be launched within one post sits at about seventy, though it is again limited to the number of strikes, allowing about three dozen to be launched with each gesture. But wait! It gets better! The disciple has now learned to launch about two dozen needles without any gesture whatsoever, producing the possibility of launching a very loose sphere of needles about them once per post. While this may not sound like much, the fact that this may be done with essentially no warning can be quite a terrifying thing.	2	5	2	Tengoku no Saboten (Heavenly Cactus) -A fearsome development upon the same principles that made Nakkuru and Anaguma no Tsume possible, Tengoku no Saboten is a potent defensive maneuver the disciple learns to engage efficiently whenever in conflict with another hand-to-hand fighter of any merit. Simply put, if the disciple has time to register that an attack is coming from an opponent, they are able to cover their entire body in spines, as is characteristic of the bloodline. However, these are not the same senbon-sized spines that they have been able to summon all over their body previously. At this point, the needles end up being much more similar to those produced by the Anaguma no Tsume technique they learned as an adept of Hyakunen no Hana, essentially causing their body to suddenly sprout six-inch knives all over. The implications upon an incoming fist or foot in this situation are quite dire for its owner, suddenly finding themselves kicking into less a person-even a person covered in senbon-and more a pillar of blades. Further, if the assailant is not able to stop short of the sudden defensive covering and the blades sink into flesh, doing the obvious damage that will do, the needles will actually detach in the offending limb, remaining quite the thorn in the paw, so to speak.	Mayonaka no kaika (Midnight Flowering) [[Requirements: Control 15, Power 15, Reserves 13, Clan GM Approval]] -After the needles have taken root through Nezuku, this is the next step: Mayonaka no kaika. Taking advantage of all the vital energy and nutrients the needles have now tapped into, the needles actively pull on them, producing vibrant blossoms in a wide variety of colors to sprout from the needles. This beauty covers up what is really happening to the new host of the needles, causing pain and strain along the afflicted areas such that these areas are effectively immobilized as the roots draw nutrients, moisture, and life from the flesh surrounding them, often leaving the victim able to do little but feel pain and speak. [[Target must have been successfully targeted by and under the effect of Nezuku. The user and target must be within ten meters of each other for the technique to be used successfully. Cannot be done in the same post as Nezuku.]]Sabaku no uzu boko (Dust Devil Strike) [[Requirements: Control 15, Power 15, Reserves 13]] -Launching a barrage of needles forward, the user causes them to spin about each other, gathering something of a vortex about them of wind and sand that can knock the target off their feet with even a near miss in addition to making the needles themselves much harder to see.	18	19	19	0	0	0	0	16	0
891	6	6	Flowers of a Hundred Years	Hyakunen no Hana	The penultimate stage before the disciple is considered a master of the Arechihana bloodline sees a number of increases. The ability to perform gestures and launch needles has truly reached such ludicrous levels that it is impractical to number how many needles are launched with mere gestures, topping out somewhere in the mid eighty range. The significant improvement here is the number of needles able to be released without any gesture whatsoever; increasing from the two dozen previously to some five dozen per post of this stage, allowing them to establish what is essentially a dead zone surrounding them.	2	5	2		Harimanbon (10,000 Needles)//Mukaeutsu (Ambush) [[Requirements: Control 19, Power 19, Reserves 18]] -Another particularly dreadful use of this style and the user's inherent ability to produce needles from their skin is that, being trained now to release their needles with little really needed other than their will, application of a little chakra can make the user into a walking anti-personnel device. By making a handseal before them in which their fingers pass by each other, making something that appears similar to two rows of spikes interlocking, the user can expel an exceedingly great quantity of needles in every direction around them within a radius of fifteen meters before the needles lose much of their force and accuracy, essentially becoming harmless. However, this outward surge is only half the story. Within three posts of the initial burst caused by Harimanbon, the user may call on the needles to retrace their trajectories, flying with the same speed they were expelled with, with a focus point on the ground just in front of where the user had been standing, allowing the user to bait the trap and maneuver their target onto the killing floor. [[Harimanbon may be used twice per thread with a three post cooldown; Mukaetsu may only be used once per thread. These two techniques cannot be used in the same post.]]Sabaku no Ryodan no Yari (Spears of the Desert Brigade) [[Requirements: Control 19, Power 19, Reserves 18]] -The pinnacle of the technique chain that began with Josho Hari, Sabaku no Ryodan no Yari takes has the user once again perform the familiar action of putting needles into the ground, the amount put under ground as superior to the amount used in Hari no Nedeko as the increase in needles used between that technique and Josho Hari were; to make it simple, there are likely thousands of needles now in the ground. The purpose this time is not to get one surprise needle throw from behind or below nor is it to create a field of deterrence from your opponent. Instead, this technique allows the user to once again direct strikes from below the surface, but these are no longer needles, black lance-like spines rising out from the surface about five feet at the direction of the user within a range of fifteen meters.	22	30	23	0	0	0	18	18	0
891	7	7	Flowers of a Hundred Years	Hyakunen no Hana	Ascending to mastery of the Hyakunen no Hana bloodline, the user at this point is a force to be reckoned with. The sheer output of needles at this point per post is a terrifying and awesome thing to behold, able to 'point and shoot' somewhere just north of ten dozen needles in a single post, broken up into however many gestures the user wishes. Further, their capability of ambiently launching needles without the use of any gestures has reached such a point that, to be near the master of this bloodline is to accept the real possibility of death at any point, able to launch a staggering nine dozen within a single post with a single impulse.	2	5	2	Tankyu-sha (Seeker) -The quickest way to dispatch a foe is the simplest: the heart or the head. While these sorts of strikes occur at lower levels, Tankyu-sha is its own kind of monster. Taking advantage of their monstrous speed and knowledge of an opponent's vitals, the Hyakunen no Hana master will close the distance to make a single focused strike, their small and ring finger folded down to their palm with the thumb over, stabbing forward with their index and middle finger as if they were a sword themselves. As impact is made, a single needle is projected out through the middle finger with a fiendish intent. In the case of the heart, the victim is only a few beats away from severe hemorrhaging and, almost definitely, death. If the head is the target, the strike will typically be delivered from behind, targeting the spinal cord nearest to the base of the brain as they can manage; the trauma is typically enough the cause paralysis and/or death. That is the goal of Tankyu-sha: to seek out life and end it.	Chitose no Kaika (Millenial Flowering) [[Requirements: Control 26, Power 25, Reserves 24, Clan GM Approval]] -The final part of the flowering chain of jutsu, Chitose no Kaika, is a dreadful thing to witness. Chitose no Kaika can be activated at any point in the posts following Mayonaka no Kaika, the user silently urging the blooms to tap into the new host's vital systems and especially their chakra circulatory system, drawing out all available resources from the host in order to ensure their own survival. For those who possess a chakra circulatory system, this will typically result in the roots completely infiltrating that network to such a degree that, even if they were to survive, the victim would never be able to channel chakra again. Perhaps the bigger concern is the blood and nutrients being harvested into the root network, now mighty and incredibly painful. At this point, the victim is likely completely immobilized. The user need only make a single handseal in order to tell the needles to finish the job, turning the victim in little more than fertile soil, frozen in their last pose until decomposition sets in. [[Requires opponent's permission or an NPC. Requires at least eight needles to have flowered under Mayonaka no Kaika's effects. Targets must have been successfully targeted by Mayonaka no Kaika and still under its effects. The user and target must be within ten meters of each other for the technique to be used successfully. May be used during the same post as Chitose no Kaika through use of the Arechihana Ocotillo archetype's special.]]Koryu Tsukuru (I Will Make Desolate) [[Requirements: Control 26, Power 25, Reserves 24]] -Just as Father Sky does not always bless those beneath him, scorching them with his fire and wrath, so must his servants do from time to time. Some opponents are not worthy of being made tribute to those that bore the Arechihana. And for them, their fate is ruination. Koryu Tsukuru is a simple enough technique with devastating implications. By making a single handseal, the Hyakunen no Hana master may detonate any and every one of their needles not still inside their body that they wish, each exploding with the force of an explosive note. In addition, each of the exploding needles splinters into about a dozen additional needles that fly out from each explosion with great force.	29	40	30	0	0	0	22	22	0
890	1	1	Hakkenshi Taijutsu	Hakkendan	Hakkenshi at this level are only beginning to tread the first few steps in a mile-long journey. It's the stage of learning the fundamentals: how to punch properly with a solid fist, how to carry out a snap kick, generally how to fight without hurting yourself in the process. Above all, the clan member is taught how to keep a clear head in battle. To succumb to anger is to succumb to evil itself; one must avoid the mantle of sin, for it is a heavy burden to bear. Calming rituals, even in the middle of combat, are encouraged to keep focused and concentrated, to avoid being provoked into thoughtless action. In terms of training, the main focus is in building up the clan member's core strength.The 107 Bead Rosary is not yet included in the teachings and thus cannot be used as a weapon.As a beginner in the teachings of Hakkendan, the Hakkenshi can only form the first four of the eight beads in the 8 Bead Rosary. They cannot be manipulated individually and must move as a combined swarm. After striking an object once, the bead will shatter and requires a cooldown of one post before it can be reformed. They have yet to develop a solid consistency to withstand attacks, so they're useless in defending against anything. The beads must remain within a two foot radius of the Hakkenshi. Their Strength and Speed is only a quarter of the clan member's Power and Control.Beads formed: Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi	3					0	0	0	0	0	0	5	3	0
890	2	2	Hakkenshi Taijutsu	Hakkendan	With a better grip on the basics, the Hakkenshi is now working on building up his endurance. They learn how to fight defensively and efficiently, conserving their energy to prolong encounters and waste away their opponent. The biggest danger is being overwhelmed by someone much stronger and faster, who can break past their guard and demolish them in moments. Combat starts to become three dimensional for the Hakkenshi. The battlefield is far from linear, and it is time for the Hakkenshi to learn it.The 107 Bead Rosary is still not included in the teachings of the style and as such cannot be used as a weapon.The fifth bead in the 8 Bead Rosary can now take shape and join the ring of four to make a quintet. Their range has increased to a four foot radius around the Hakkenshi but still can only be moved as a cluster. After striking an object, a bead will shatter and require a one post cooldown to reform. While they still hold little defensive application, the beads can now at least soften a blow by placing themselves in the path of the attack and absorbing a bit of its force before breaking. They possess a third of the clan member's Power and Control.Bead formed: Chuu			3		Bushido (Samurai Code of Chivalry)With this technique, the Hakkenshi can transform the beads of their 8 Bead Rosary into sharp slivers of glass with points on each end. It can be done en masse or selectively, but the beads that are affected by Bushido cannot be used for Ninjutsu techniques until they revert back to their spherical form. Bushido lasts for four posts and requires a one post cooldown.	0	0	6	0	0	0	8	6	0
890	3	3	Hakkenshi Taijutsu	Hakkendan	The Hakkenshi now incorporates speed into the style, but mostly in the subtle movements. Twisting at the last second to dampen the force of an attack, hopping aside to avoid being skewered by an attack, Hakkendan does not employ the tenets of speed in order to dash around wildly. It exists to augment the existing ability, not to become an ability on its own. The environment is also taken into consideration, for each stone or tree could prove to be the deciding factor in a struggle.At last, the 107 Bead Rosary can be deigned as battle equipment. Because of its light weight, the rosary is best at landing quick and sharp lashes that sting and harass the opponent from a range. The Hakkenshi learns how to coil and uncoil it rapidly in the heat of battle while keeping from tangling it up. As it is, though, the 107 Bead Rosary is a support weapon rather than the main mode of combat.The 8 Bead Rosary has improved yet again, taking on the sixth bead into its family. Control over the rosary has increased to the point where the six beads can be controlled as two separate groups of three instead of having to move together. Their range has been expanded to a six foot radius and can now land two attacks before breaking. They can also withstand an infinite number of physical attacks that are of Level 2 Strength, soften a single blow (before being shattered) of Level 3, but stand no chance against Level 4 and higher. The are now commanded by a half of the clan member's Power and control statistics.Bead Formed: Shin		3			Zenshin (Moral Sense)With a strong notion of conviction and scruples, there is no limit as to how many people the Hakkenshi can save. Similarly, with Zenshin, the range of the 107 Bead Rosary is extended. While Zenshin is applied, the rosary can stretch as far as fifteen feet and retract in a snap, making it into a handy mid-range armament. Zenshin has no duration.	0	0	8	0	0	0	11	9	0
890	4	4	Hakkenshi Taijutsu	Hakkendan	Having a firm grasp over the stepping stones of Hakkendan, nothing is out of reach of the clan member anymore. Just as in the cycle of life, they begin training their strength again, introducing forceful palm strikes into their combinations. With the addition of the 107 Bead Rosary, the practitioner has become a formidable combatant in close to mid-range, able to strike with powerful blows up close while stinging and whipping the enemy at a distance. The Hakkenshi is trained to split their concentration in the occasion of multiple adversaries, making use of the hand to deal with one while employing the rosary to keep the rest at bay.An increased flow of Chakra into the rosary also ramps up its damage potential. Small, shocking strikes become acute lashes. A certain 'chain' technique has even been developed where the Hakkenshi will swing the rosary in a wide arc while pulling it inwards; if the rosary hits, its multiple beads run across the point of impact to rub the skin raw.The 8 Bead Rosary can now make use of a grand seven beads. They can be manipulated within a range of eight feet around the clan member and can be split into two groups (four beads in one, three beads in the other) or three groups (two beads, two beads, three beads). Each bead can now last three attacks before breaking, and they've grown more hardy to be able to stand up to Level 3 Strength blows. They can take a single strike of Level 4 Strength at most, and anything higher completely obliterates them without resistance. At this stage of training, they possess three-quarters of the Hakkenshi's Power and Control.Bead formed: Kou	3				Requires: Zenshin (Moral Sense)Zenkansa (Moral Judgment)The application of Zenkansa turns the 107 Bead Rosary into an even more effective weapon. By unthreading the rosary and keeping it connected by a string of Chakra, it extends the beads into a singular line instead of a loop, thereby doubling its range up to thirty feet. Zenkansa has no duration, but while it is in action, the 107 Bead Rosary cannot be used for any other techniques.	0	0	14	0	0	0	18	14	11
890	5	5	Hakkenshi Taijutsu	Hakkendan	Hakkendan, at this point, has become a sort of lifestyle. It works again to strengthen the body and the mind. There is nothing new in terms of principle to learn, but rather a refining of what has already been established. The combined use of hand and rosary create an awe-inspiring means of combat unlike any other. The application of the rosary has almost become a natural sense to the clan member. It is used to cover their blindspots, wrap around targets and reel them in, and punish those who stand in the Hakkenshi's path.Adding more Chakra to the 107 Bead Rosary ramps up its striking power yet again. The rosary is no longer a piece of side equipment but a weapon on its own right, creating a second distinct battlefield to wage war on while the Hakkenshi deals with the close-range field. However, an addition to its power slightly reduces its speed, though the clan member can opt to take away from its power to restore that speed.The final eighth bead of the 8 Bead Rosary can now be summoned, though mastery over it has not yet been attained. The rosary can be split into two groups (four beads each) or three groups (three beads, three beads, two beads) instead of being mass manoeuvred. The can move in a ten foot radius around the clan member and possess their master's full Power and Control statistics in their movement. Level 4 and below Strength attacks hardly phase them, while Level 5 can break them in one hit. Even stronger attacks will blow through them effortlessly. Each bead can now connect with four attacks before fragmenting.Bead formed: Tei			3		Shoukin no Sata (State of Redemption)With all eight beads of the 8 Bead Rosary in tow, the Hakkenshi can protect themselves from enemy Ninjutsu by initiating the State of Redemption. The eight beads will form a ring in between the attack and the clan member and start to spin extremely quickly, creating a blast of wind that will blow the attack right back at the adversary. This works on Ninjutsu that are two stages below the clan member's highest stage in Hakkendan.	0	0	16	0	0	0	23	18	15
890	6	6	Hakkenshi Taijutsu	Hakkendan	The Hakkenshi has now become a priest of divine power. Yet again, all they can do is work on what they already know to become even better at it, and in this stage of Hakkendan, that is accomplished by boosting their speed. Slightly faster offense, slightly faster defense, it's hardly noticeable but it does make its difference. The clan member is fully capable of holding off multiple opponents all on his own by wielding the 107 Bead Rosary together with his bare hand.The style of the 107 Bead Rosary is now completely up to the practitioner. They can choose to sacrifice power for speed, or speed for power, or even balance the two against each other. What was once a religious adornment has now grown into a weapon that can stand up to the mightiest blade and even overcome it by wrapping itself around the cold steel and pulling it free from the hand of the tyrant who wields it.The change in the 8 Bead Rosary lies only in improvement. Each bead can now make five attacks before falling apart and needing to be reformed (as always, with a one post cooldown). They can also withstand up to and including Level 5 Strength blows steadily. Level 6 will break them after a singular strike, while Level 7 and above can smash them apart with ease. The range has upped itself to twelve feet and they can be split into any number of groups, or even be controlled individually.		3			Shujousaido (Enlightenment of the Masses)With this technique, the Hakkenshi can evolve their 8 Bead Rosary into a second state. The respective symbols on the first through eighth bead morph into Nyo, Ze, Chiku, Shou, Hotsu, Bo, Dai, and Shin. After doing so, the beads take on a golden colour, and though their offensive and defensive resilience does not change, their power is increased. They now possess 150% (rounded down) of the Hakkenshi's Power and Control statistics. Shujousaido lasts for three posts. After the duration of Shujousaido expires, the Chuu, Shin, Kou, and Tei beads shatter.	16	0	20	0	0	0	27	24	24
890	7	7	Hakkenshi Taijutsu	Hakkendan	This is as far as the Hakkenshi can go in the path of Hakkendan. They have reached the end of the journey and stand atop a mountain. The only thing left to them is to keep up in their practice, to never lose ground and slip. They have reached the pinnacle of what all Hakkenshi aspire to be: a balance of will, passion, and resolve. Armed with the 107 Bead Rosary, they can purify the unclean or lay waste to those who are insistent upon seating themselves in sin.The 107 Bead Rosary is even more formidable than before. It is a high speed, high power weapon hidden within a harmless-looking artefact. However, this rosary has become the most trustworthy partner in the Hakkenshi's life. It will not fail them, it will not desert them, and forever shall it remain bound to their spirit.Like all other tenets of Hakkendan, the 8 Bead Rosary has reached its peak. It has free range within a fourteen foot radius of the clan member and can be controlled in a cluster or broken down into its individual counterparts. Anything below Level 7 Strength will not budge the beads, while Level 7 Strength itself is strong enough only to break them after a direct hit. Level 8 Strength and higher, of course, is mighty enough to shatter these precious orbs.		3			Requires: Shujousaido (Enlightnment of the Masses)Shin'inhyoubyou (Transcendent)This final bound is what makes the Hakkenshi who has achieved this state so very fearsome. With the initiation of this technique, the symbols on the 8 Bead Rosary change, in order of the first through the eighth, to A, Noku, Ta, Ra, San, Myaku, San, Bo, and Dai. The beads themselves turn a powdery silver colour. With Shin'inhyoubyou, the 8 Bead Rosary is powered up to 200% (rounded down) of the Hakkenshi's Power and Control and lasts three posts. This cannot be stacked with Shujousaido. After the duration of Shin'inhyoubyou expires, all eight beads are destroyed.	22	0	22	0	0	0	33	33	33

888	1	1	Divine Providence	Setsuri	Learning to properly wield and fight with two blades proves to be a difficult task, for the Tsuriau are spectacular swordsmen only because of their obsession with it. Clansmen begin their training in wielding their weapons at an early age and focus on fluid movements from stance to stance, form to form, and then they do it again. No child above the age of ten has failed to learn the fundamentals behind the movement of their blades. Refining comes after their parents can trust them to hold their swords without stabbing themselves in the foot.	4	5				0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
888	2	2	Divine Providence	Setsuri	After basic understanding comes grace. Here the Tsuriau is brought to understand that the dance of blades is just that; a dance. Encouraged to move forward slowly by their family against their wishes, here they are taught rhythm. One sword strikes while the other waits, and when the one that waits cannot block, one must dodge. Watching a pair of younger members practicing is not unlike watching another pair learning the steps of a dance. More worried over their footwork than swords, with an older man or woman always watching and raping on something to provide a beat, barking to keep their back straight and stop tripping over their own feet. Seeing it sparks snickers in many who don-t know what those same children can do with steel.	4	5		Double StrikeAs hinted; the double strike is the first technique involving the use of both swords. Extending their arms across to the opposite side of their chest, the user effectively 'loads- both arms to pull as much force from the swing as possible. Once done, both arms will snap outward, cutting anything in front of the Student. Originally designed for decapitations, it-s simplicity has made it-s use in combat far more widespread.Enduring VengeanceIn a feat that would previously have knocked the sword out of the students hand for their effort, the Tsuriau redirects an incoming sword (or otherwise) attack with one weapon; dedicating the other to a stabbing maneuver at their now open front. Many an opponent have been felled by this quick striking blade, most of them wouldn-t have required the clan-s bloodline activated.Tumbling SandThe practitioner rolls out of the way of a frontal attack and lands crouched on the ground, ready to strike; all within the span of a second. This is less an attack and more a setup for techniques such as a Double Strike, or others that have yet to be introduced.Riding the GalesWhen facing another wielding a sword, it is imperative that one remembers the basics of fighting edge against edge, which typically means those edges must not meet at all. Rather than blocking as is assumed to be the proper form by most who do not wield blades guess, it is necessary for one to redirect the enemies- weapon by using the flank of your sword to push it off its chosen path. To fight in any other manner will cause the user to completely ruin their sword on their first strike or block.		0	8	6	0	0	0	0	6	0
888	3	3	Divine Providence	Setsuri	With technique refined, the advancing children of the Tsuriau find themselves encouraged to continue at the aggressive pace that their elders had droned to a slow and aggravatingly slow advance. A clansmember still watches over their training with a sharp eye, but there are far fewer flaws for them to pick at. Training finally begins to take on the aspect of a real battle as newer aspects are included; strikes with the legs and unexpected blows with the elbows, even the hilt of their blade. The long-taught grace remains with the Tsuriau as he makes more open use of his speed. While the motions at this level are far from the ridiculous that play out in the minds of many genin, the Meimyaku is a mark of prestige as well as power. It is hard not to be caught up in the movements of the fighters while watching two Tsuriau of this level train.	4	5		Trick of the WindThe user crosses their arms again, as if committing to a double strike. Afterwords the Student quickly pivots on his heel, using the lowered stance to quickly transition into a round-kick, preferably to the face; though anything would do. Simple at first glance, it requires a strong grasp of swordsmanship to quickly change the intent of the stance without the opponent noticing. Ideally, they-ll be wondering what happened while they reel from the blow.RejectionWhile it is true that when extremely close to a swordsman you can often force them to move backward to allow a proper slice, many opponents and students alike forget that the hilt is a hard blunt object with potential of its own. This technique involves smashing a foe that has wandered too close with the butt of their hilt. At the very least it will push the opponent back, and if the user is strong enough it might even shatter their fragile nose.Wrath of the HeavensDesigned as an aid against any who would attack the user from behind; the student holds both blades perpendicular to each other in front of him, so that each is pointed toward the ground. He then steps backward, moving his body gracefully and pulling his swords up as he does so; as he turns around the Tsuriau brings the full weight of the swords down from above, promising not one cut, but two.		0	13	7	0	0	0	0	8	0
888	4	4	Divine Providence	Setsuri	Understanding, grace, and speed. For every stage of growth a new virtue added to the Meimyaku-s excellence. Here, they learn to control their bodies' natural reactions. By using the surroundings to their advantage a Tsuriau is more than capable of movement. They glide across the ground, feet never pausing, steps never faltering as they search for some way to sneak inside an enemy-s guard. Quick to act and quicker to counter, that in itself would be extremely impressive by itself even if the previous disciplines of the Meimyaku were not so obvious in their movements. Together, they make a choice between slaughter in a pit with lions and battle with the user a worrying dilemma.	4	5		Bloody WhirlwindBest used after ducking to escape a high attack or when surrounded by enemies, the user must be close to the ground for this technique to work properly. Grasping both swords tightly in hand, the legs are twisted so as too lock into position. Springing upward and using the momentum of the spin, the user slices away at the air around them; aiming to cut whatever happens to be surrounding them at the moment. This move, unfortunately, is very easy to read unless the Student is somehow forced to the ground, and is very taxing. It is rarely seen in combat, but often used in training to build endurance. This is seen as no more than an impressive looking deterrent until the higher echelons of the style are reached, and this maneuver is pulled off swifter than many can react.Biting SandstormFor this technique to be successful, the user must have his back to a wall or similar object. By using this wall as a jumping point, it is possible to quite literally fly over a nearby target-s head with a swiftness that leaves few openings. A common practice is to slash at the shoulder of an opponent, land, and end it with a clean blow to the back; though it rarely requires a finishing blow.Shifting the TideWhen engaged in battle with any sort of polearm it is vital that the movement of the other weapon must be stopped before moving in. By using the broad edge of the blade closest to the hilt it is possible to keep such a weapon from being immediately used to cut off your approach, and once done the user can close in with the other blade. This strategy-or at least one like it-is essential, as polearms have a wider range than the Tsuriau-s own weapons, putting the user at a sizable disadvantage when facing them.		11	18	14	0	0	0	0	14	0
888	5	5	Divine Providence	Setsuri	The basic tenets of the Meimyaku have been instilled into the student beyond the Tsuriau-s power to undo, even if they wanted too. Now there are no guidelines and no restrictions aside from the ones a Tsuriau sets on their own. Here is where a clansmember learns that there are flaws in the general techniques, things that do not fit the shape of their body, or take full advantage of their flexibility. More than anything else, this is the moment where the clan acknowledges a Tsuriau-s prowess as a swordsman, and lets them go their own way.	4	5		The Eagle Spreads its WingsA simple maneuver practiced often by Tsuriau as they grow; a simple twirl of their blades in a figure eight, dismissed out of hand by most as a trick of flashing blades and quick wrists to impress idiotic opponents, but to a trained Tsuriau there is a purpose. With that quick gesture, projectiles thrown by those whose skill in it is less than the user-s own in the Meimyaku can be deflected without much trouble.Cat on Hot GlassFollowing a parry or dodge, the Tsuriau steps forward with their back foot as they flip the sword around in their hands so that the blade points toward the ground. Stepping past the enemy, they stab the weapon into the side of their enemy, through the lungs or heart. The change from traditional swordplay requires a great deal of experience to use properly, along with the ability to fight with all their ability while taking full advantage of their own creativity, breaking beaten-in forms for the sake of catching an enemy off guard.		15	23	18	0	0	0	0	16	0
888	6	6	Divine Providence	Setsuri	Many in the clan consider this the last step before mastery of the Meimyaku, and all know that the last is attained only by a rare few among them. The body has been pushed so hard that it has neared its natural limit, and the user makes up for that by further refining their technique. There is no wasted movement in their dance and not a millisecond-s hesitation in their strikes. They dodge by a hairsbreadth and follow it up with counters fluid enough to leave even a wary Jounin heavily wounded from the damage of their blade alone.	4	5				24	28	23	0	0	0	17	19	0
888	7	7	Divine Providence	Setsuri	The gap between a swordsman and a Blademaster is not small. Training and conditioning, instinct, quick hands and intuition can only do so much in perfecting the dance of death. The Meimyaku is about swiftness, flow, of instantaneous responses, prefect movement and adaptability, but the heart of their training is acceptance. What must be, will be, and a Tsuriau will not flicker an eyelid even as the air turns to fire in their lungs. In battle, they are passionless and efficient. No physical hardship will faze them and no temptations lure them from their course. Implacable as an avalanche, a Tsuriau that has reached this final frontier is the image of perfect composure in all things.	4	5				34	35	30	0	0	0	22	22	0
887	1	1	Stone Beserker Style	None	Focus: At this stage, the user is just beginning to learn to set aside the distractions of battle in order to focus himself entirely on the task at hand. Due to this inexperience, his focus is only slightly better than the standard Shinobi.Swordsmanship: The user has not yet become accustomed to the sheer size of the sword/axe that they wield. As a result, simple swings and parrying that takes advantage of the width of the blade are the main techniques of the practitioner of this level.	4	2	3			4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
887	2	2	Stone Beserker Style	None	Focus: Here, the focus of the user becomes slightly more apparent. The ears and mind of the berserker are able to almost completely filter out minute sounds such as the chirping of birds and the running of water. While the battle at hand is still a broad picture rather than the narrow focal point that it is to become in later stages, advancement has nevertheless been made from the awkward beginnings of the style.Swordsmanship: At this stage, the user has become more comfortable with the wielding of a sword/axe of immense size. Blows have become more fluid and can be executed in a slightly faster succession, though offense is still generally limited to individual, simple swings of the blade, and parrying is still reliant on the use of the size of the blade to catch the oncoming strikes of foes.	4	2	3	ShovelOf the principles taught to the Berserk Swordsman, perhaps the most important is the concept of gaining and maintaining the advantage in combat by any means necessary. Due to this emphasis, it is not uncommon to see a practitioner of the style executing techniques that would be seen as 'less than honorable' in order to achieve this end. This technique is a tactic of this kind. By planting the tip of his blade into the earth and subsequently rising with a shoveling motion, the Berserk Swordsman is able to send forth a cloud of dust, sand, and rock to the face of his foe in the intention of distracting or blinding him or her long enough to continue their assault.	BerserkThis technique is the hallmark of the style, and the aspect that allows the practitioner of this form of combat to become truly frightening. Through the intense focus that is taught as a building block to those who practice this style, the user is able to boil the deepest, most potent emotions of the human soul into the core of one's being, and subsequently allow these emotions to take control in an explosion of feral savagery. The state of berserk lasts for 1 post plus the number of stages the user has achieved in the style. The action of entering into the mindset counts as the action for the post, though the count in regards to number of posts in the mindset does not begin until the next post by the user. However, it should be noted that any genjutsu that would render the Swordsman emotionally abnormal (fear, inflict emotion, ect.) would prevent the Swordsman from entering into the state of Berserk until the genjutsu has been removed. Furthermore, all subsequent special techniques are only accessible while the Shinobi is Berserk. Each subsequent berserk special technique get one feat choose from the above, at the end of berserk state, the user is so strained that he cannot use ninjutsu and genjutsu for 3 posts but still can use taijutsu to defend himself.	8	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0
887	3	3	Stone Beserker Style	None	Focus: The ability to harness one's emotions into a cyclone of destruction has In turn also brought about a new level of focus in the mind of the Berserk Swordsman. At this stage, he is capable of blocking out more complex things, such as nearby conversations, or the sound of a nearby rushing stream.Swordsmanship: The user has now begun to grasp a small bit of how to take advantage of the size of the sword that is inherent to his style. His attacks are now no longer limited to the simple, straightforward slashes of the past, evident in the inclusion of thrusts and powerful overhead strikes into the arsenal of the swordsman. Furthermore, the art of rising to meet a foe's attack while parrying in order to drive his quarry back is now gradually beginning to take shape. However, while the user has realized the size of his sword/axe can be used as a great asset, his body has not yet fully grown accustomed to hefting the blade, and thus cannot strike and recover from blows as quickly as needed in order to fully press the advantage on his foe.	4	2	3	ShieldWhile the Stone Berserker is well trained in blocking the attacks of those who dare face them head on, the foe who fights from afar have always been a thorn in the side of the Berserking Swordsman. Striking from a distance with a multitude of projectiles, these pests are capable of dealing damage while staying far away from the relentless sword/axe of the Berserker. To counter this, a simple yet effective method of defense was devised. Taking advantage of the immense size and width of the weapon they employ, the Swordsman uses his blade itself as a shield against an oncoming onslaught of projectiles. While this does not offer perfect protection against a vast multitude of projectiles, it is fully capable of deflecting a reasonable number of weapons.	Overwhelmed MindOvertaken by unbridled, raging emotion, the mind of the Stone Berserker cannot be reasoned with, nor can he be halted by any means other than the halting of his physical body. Due to this overwhelming inferno of emotion that now burns hot in the brain of the Swordsman, users of genjutsu will find that they are no longer able to affect the emotional state of the Berserker. Though genjutsu that affect the senses of the Swordsman will still perform their task, any illusionary art built to instill fear, sorrow, agony, indifference, or any false sense of emotion will be met with utter failure.	10	0	10	0	8	0	0	0	0
887	4	4	Stone Beserker Style	None	Focus: Here, the Swordsman's ability to focus oneself on the battle at hand truly begins to take shape and grant a true advantage in battle. Applying the ability to block out the sounds of the world around him that has been so important in the past stages, the Shinobi is now capable of focusing his ears entirely on a particular opponent. Through this, he will find that sounds that would normally muffle the footsteps and movements of a foe, such as a small explosion, now provide no cover for the movements of an opponent. As a result, the Swordsman is now able to keep track of his quarry more effectively, and therefore continue his assault even if his foe should try to escape.Swordsmanship: At this stage, experience has brought about a new level of skill in the Stone Berserker. Now quite used to wielding a blade that would not be considered rational by a normal man, the Stone Berserker is now able to wield his sword/axe with a fluidity that betrays the mass of the weapon. Despite the immense size of the weapon, the Swordsman is now capable of wielding his instrument of destruction with two hands with little to no show of strain, and even begins to go so far as showing some (albeit limited) skill in wielding the heft in one hand. Swiftly, the blade of the Swordsman rises to meet the blows of the opponent, and multiple swings in rapid succession are now possible. Due to this, the ability to press forward with a constant onslaught of attacks begins to come into play; an ability of which the Swordsman should take full advantage.	4	2	3	DisarmAn armed foe is generally more dangerous in combat; this is a widely accepted rule of battle. Through the use of a weapon, an opponent is better able to parry blows, and gains a more lethal touch to all of his attacks. With this principle in mind, the Berserk Swordsman has devised a tactic to counter this very problem. By using the sheer weight of his sword/axe to his advantage, the swordsman swings hard at the weapon itself, and upon impact, exerts an extra amount of force against his opponent's weapon. Obviously, the force exerted against the weapon is tremendous, and all but the strongest foe's wielding the most durable of weapons would find it extremely difficult to keep their weapon from flying from their hands and to the floor across the battlefield.		15	13	15	0	14	0	0	0	0
887	5	5	Stone Beserker Style	None	Focus: At this stage, the ears of the Swordsman have learned to focus almost entirely on a single target. Individual movements can be heard quite clearly even in the face of a near deafening explosion, and a small idea of what attack a user of a familiar taijutsu style is preparing can be devised through the sense of hearing alone; a useful talent if the swordsman has lost sight of his foe, or is temporarily blinded. However, while the ears of the shinobi have been trained to bring their focal point entirely to one target, the eyes have not yet achieved this same level. Flashy movements on the part of the foe can still cause the swordsman to become distracted, swift, discreet actions are still capable of escaping unnoticed, and a shinobi in hiding may still conceal himself from the eyes of the Berserk Swordsman.Swordsmanship: Rising upwards to a new plateau in skill, the Berserk Swordsman at this stage is capable of demonstrating feats of amazing ability. Now extremely comfortable with the concept of maintaining a constant onslaught of attacks on his foe, the swordsman strikes swiftly without mercy, lashing out blow after blow with an almost unceasing fluidity. Furthermore, the Berserk shinobi has now learned to wield his blade with one hand quite effectively, allowing him to continue on with his assault with decent, though still hampered, intensity should one arm become disabled. Furthermore, the act of parrying has now reached a new level of fluidity; by rising to meet his foes attack with a blow of his own, he is able turn the momentum of his opponent's own strike against him, and open up opportunities to again press forward with his own attack.	4	2	3	CleaveOpponents who employ long handled weapons, such as spears, staffs, and pole arms, have long been a menace to the Berserk Swordsman. By taking advantage of the reach of their own weapons, they are able to strike from a distance and keep the Swordsman at bay. Knowing this, users of the Stone Berserk Sword Style have devised a method of countering those who take this method of attack. By striking hard towards the long handle of the foe's weapon, they are subsequently able to cleave strait through the shaft of the object, and therefore shorten it. Through this, they are able to force the opponent to come closer to battle; a fact of which the Stone Berserker should then take full advantage.	Nerve DeadCompletely overtaken by a flurry of emotions that drive him relentlessly onward, the mind of those who enter into the State of Berserk knows no distraction. Battling ever onward with frightening intensity, no sensation is capable of finding its way into the mass of emotion that now dominates the mind of the user: not even pain. While fists may strike the swordsman time and time again, and blades may slice his skin, the mind of the user simply does not register these things as important. However, while the sensation of pain may not register in the mind of the Swordsman, it should be noted that the damage that comes along with the pain is still very real, and will affect the user accordingly.	21	15	20	0	16	0	0	0	0
887	6	6	Stone Beserker Style	None	Focus: The focus of the Swordsman at this level has nearly reach its peak of the focal arts. Now completely comfortable focusing his ears on a target, and is able to fight quite competently even when blinded. The focus of his vision has also grown to a new level of skill, and the Stone Swordsman is now able to completely focus his sight on a target, enabling him to notice subtle motions made by the target. Though, it should be noted that this increased level of focus does leave the possibility of a surprise attack from a second opponent as a very real danger.Swordsmanship: Now nearing the zenith of ability in the style, the Berserker is now capable of wielding his sword/axe nearly flawlessly. The act of parrying has now become nearly instinctive, and wielding his sword with one hand now serves as almost no problem, though the weight of the sword limits the duration of this method of battling. The ferocity that serves as the hallmark of the style has also nearly reached perfection; evident in the fact that users at this level are capable of unleashing blow after blow with their weapon with virtually no time needed for recovery between strikes.	4	2	3			29	18	28	0	18	18	0	0	0
887	7	7	Stone Beserker Style	None	Focus: Now at the peak of their ability, the Stone Berserker now has access to a nearly inhuman level of focus. Now able to block out all sounds but the movements, breathe and surroundings of the opponent, the Swordsman is able to keep track of position of a foe unaided by sound muffling genjutsu at all times. The visual focus of the Swordsman has grown to enable him to focus his complete attention on multiple targets, yet still maintain a level of awareness that prevents his focus from blinding him from incoming surprise attacks all the while.Swordsmanship: Having reached the apex of their ability with a sword, the Stone Berserker is now able to wield his massive weapon with an ease that completely betrays its size. Whether wielding a sword with one hand or two, oncoming blows are deflected and countered with fluid grace, and the flurry of blows that can be unleashed when on the offensive are swift, startlingly powerful, and can come in a near endless stream without visible sign of fatigue; a perfect synthesis of flowing, relentless and powerful strikes.	4	2	3		PreservationPrerequisites: All previous Special AbilitiesThe pinnacle of the strength granted by the State of Berserk, the ability of preservation is frightening indeed. Already unable to feel the pain brought about by the wounds inflicted by the blades, ninjutsu and genjutsu of their foes, the Berserker is now bestowed with the ability to fight on through wounds to which those in a normal state of mind would succumb. Though their organs may be punctured and their body nearly bled dry, the mind of the Swordsman forces them to fight on with an untiring ferocity, though a blow that would bring about instant death, such as decapitation or the ripping out of the heart, would still bring about the demise of the swordsman. However, despite the fact the user is granted the ability to fight on through lethal injuries while his mind is overtaken, such is not the case with the state of calm. When the duration of the State of Berserk expires, the Swordsman will once again be subject to his own wounds, and will suffer their full affect, including instant death if the wounds suffered during his or her time spent in emotional frenzy are great enough.	38	25	36	0	22	22	0	0	0
886	1	1	Stone Body	Ishi no Karada	Stances: None	4	1	4	Tsuruhashihijishou (Pickaxe Elbow)Requirements: NoneDescription: The only complicated move the shinobi is capable of at this stage. An elbow attack that is delivered downwards or backwards. Often combined in a combo.Shoushitsu (Rising Knee)Requirement: NoneDescription: The user brings his knee upwards to knock the air out of the enemy-s stomach and to make the enemy more vulnerable and open for a new and more powerful attack.Hourakushou (Cave-in Palm)Requirement: NoneDescription: A basic Taijutsu attac. Similar to how a Hyuuga attacks with a gentle fist attack, the Yama-Ken user rams his open palm forward to hit the enemy-s chest and belly. A direct hit can knock the air out of the opponent.		4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
886	2	2	Stone Body	Ishi no Karada	Stances: None	4	1	4	Hasai Houyou (Crushing hug)Requirement: NoneDescription: The user lunges and puts his arms around his enemy-s whole body, holding their arms and upper body in a tight hug. He holds the enemy tightly, making it hard for the enemy to move. Upper level taijutsu users can easily escape, as well as shinobi with a Strength and a Willpower stat above that of the user. However, if the enemy is too weak, he is stuck and cannot move, leaving him vulnerable to attacks from other people. This technique can also have the unfortunate consequence of having the user being hurt by an attack from an ally.Kannyuu Tanima (Collapsing Valley)Requirement: NoneDescription: The user readies his fists on either side of a part of the target-s body, most commonly the head or ribs, then pounds inward with great force at a slight downward angle. This is a simple but effective attack aims to distract the enemy by causing pain in two places simultaneously.	Doton Gurabo (Earth Element Stone Gloves)Description: By pounding both fists into the ground the user of this jutsu is able to pull them back out, covered in earth and held tightly together by chakra. Basically used like fists or a shield, the user is able to both defend and attack with them. Eventually, though, the stone will wear away after three posts.Kuma Kobushi (Bear Fist)Description: A highly powerful attack in which the user swats down at the target with a stiff, open palm, as if he were a grizzly bear clawing at an opponent. This move calls for focusing a lot of strength into the shoulder, arm, wrist, hand, and fingers to ensure a great amount of force being brought down on the enemy. The second stage of this attack is a temporary paralysis on the enemy if the hit connects squarely. For a short time, around 1 post, the target cannot move his muscles where hit.	7	0	7	0	6	0	0	0	0
886	3	3	Stone Body	Ishi no Karada	Stance: None	4	1	4	Axe KickRequirements: NoneDescription: A powerful kick technique. The user swings his back foot upward, then brings it slamming down to hit the opponent with the bottom of the heel, usually on the opponent's shoulder. If the user misses, the foot can just swing back into position.Mountain RisingRequirements: NoneDescription: A simple uppercut technique. The shinobi uses his back hand to swing upward for a vicious uppercut that can send a person with lower Strength stats flying.Double Rock SwingRequirements: NoneDescription: A powerful double-hit combo that can also be used to fake out an opponent, the user first swings forward with a roundhouse kick from the back foot. Using the momentum of the kick, the user continues his turn, only bringing up a fist to backhand the opponent. If the first kick misses, it is possible that the opponent doesn't see the second attack coming, and can be hit by the flying backfist.	Doton Doryu Dango (Earth Element Mud Cannonball)Description: In this jutsu, the user collects and lifts a gigantic piece of earth (about the size of a beach ball) that can be thrown at his enemies, the max distance being about 20 feet.Doton: Jishin Ken (Earth Element: Earthquake Fist)Description: A good jutsu for creating openings, this one works by the user slamming a fist onto the ground, and using chakra increasing the shock created by the fist to make a small earthquake. The earthquake can't do a lot more than to shake people off their feet, though, and it only affects people within 10 feet of the user.	10	0	10	0	8	0	0	0	0
886	4	4	Stone Body	Ishi no Karada	Stances: None	4	1	4	Shougekishou (Rising Impact Palm)Requirement: NoneDescription: A palm attack that is directed straight upwards, capable of sending the heavy opponents or objects flying into the air. Once in the air, a follow-up attack is often made. Little to no damage is done with this attack. It is the follow-up that deals the most damage. Permission from the opponent must be given before this is done.Tokken (Tackle Charge)Requirement: NoneDescription: The user charges forward, using his power to put a lot of strength to his shoulder to deal heavy damage to the opponent, as well as knock the enemy down with the user-s body weight. The attack often comes as a second or third attack in a series of combos.Yamayagi Mozou (Mountain Goat Mimic)Requirement: NoneDescription: This attack calls for the user to head butt his opponent with the front of his forehead, causing painful damage to his enemy while absorbing the shock of recoil to prevent harm to his own brain. Requires no momentum to execute; the user can be standing still as little as 6 inches away from his target.	Banjin Houru (Savage Throw)Requirements: Strength 15, Stamina 13, Willpower 14, Tactic 12Description: This technique calls for the user to grab onto the arm or leg of the opponent, and then use his entire body weight to swing his target around in two quick circles. Then, while the victim is still dizzy, the user immediately slams him into the ground to take immense damage to the head and torso. If done correctly, this should be one fluid movement.Jagged DustRequirements: Strength 14, Stamina 13, Control 12, Power 10Description: Gathering chakra, the user creates a layer of dust which surrounds himself as a second skin. The chakra manipulates dust so that it becomes denser, and jagged edges appear, similar to rough uncut rocks and jewels. When punching, striking, and kicking there is now the added effect of getting hit with the jagged hard dirt, which can cause shallow wounds and scrapes.	15	13	15	0	14	0	0	0	0
886	5	5	Stone Body	Ishi no Karada	Stances: None	4	1	4	Elbow SmashRequirement: NoneDescription: Getting close to the opponent, the user grabs the back of the enemy-s head with one hand, then brings it toward himself quickly to smash the face with the elbow of the other arm.Stone Floor SweepRequirement: NoneDescription: Quickly crouching, the user sweeps out his back foot to hit the opponent-s legs. The attack causes the opponent-s legs to fall and make the user fall toward the ground. The user continues his sweep, and using the circular momentum, comes in for another sweep kick with the other foot, just as the opponent is about to hit the ground. The second kick usually hits the torso or arms of the opponent, making this a double hit combo.Steady Mountain PalmRequirement: NoneDescription: A counter attack against taijutsu, the user uses the palm of his hand and the firm foundation of his legs to block an attack, usually a punch. The palm sticks forward and intercepts a punch. The punch hits the palm, which is steady and rock solid, and the shock and energy can cause the hand of the puncher to take damage, even break the bones of the fingers. The hand can, however, take damage as well.	Savage Downward CrashDescription: First using Shougekishou to launch the opponent into the air, the user follows by jumping. At the apex of the jump, the user grabs the opponent, maneuvers the opponent underneath himself, and lands back on the ground with his knees on top of the opponent. This causes incredible amounts of damage to the torso, breaking ribs and damaging inner organs. The consent of the opponent-s owner, of course, must first be given.Rising Earth PillarDescription: Gathering chakra and strength into one hand, the user hits the ground hard, sending the chakra into the ground. The force causes a pillar of earth to shoot up to a height of 6 ft. Using chakra, the user can control where the pillar appears, usually underneath an opponent to surprise him. The earth pillar has a 1 foot diameter and can only appear within 7 ft of the user.	20	16	20	0	16	0	0	0	0
886	6	6	Stone Body	Ishi no Karada	Stance: None	4	1	4	Gangeki (Boulder Strike)Requirement: NoneDescription: An amazingly powerful punch attack. Instead of attacking the enemy by tackling them, the user pulls back his fist while running before delivering a straight powerful punch that knocks down anyone or anything. Blocking this attack takes inhuman strength.Sledgehammer Heel impact (Hanmahirushou)Requirement: NoneDescription: The user jumps far up in the air, gathers a lot of power into the right leg, foot and heel. Upon impact, the power is released and sent into whatever it hits. It deals an immense amount of damage to the torso, capable of splitting apart ribs and crushing inner organs.Flying boulder (Hishoumaruishi)Requirement: NoneDescription: The user grabs the opponent-s limbs or body and spins around while holding the enemy. When enough speed and power has been gained from the spinning, the user throws the enemy into something solid like a tree or wall. The user may also throw the enemy towards another enemy. The maximum throwing distance is 50 yards.	Saido Nadare (Second Avalanche)Description: When the user punches a target, the natural resistance that an object bears is temporarily neutralized as it absorbs the shock of the impact. However, in this technique, the user punches his target once, and then punches a second time in a fraction of a second with the same fist, so quickly that it is undetectable to the naked eye. However, because the natural resistance of the object was taken away to protect against the first punch, the second punch deals maximum damage. This results in that object shattering completely, whether it be a rock or someone-s bone.Gansaku Shindou (False Tremor)Description: When the user runs at his opponent, he purposely stomps on the ground with immense force every step of the way, causing the earth to shake and tremble like a small earthquake with chakra sent through the feet. This is meant to upset the balance and concentration of the target. When the user reaches his opponent, he can follow up with any attack of his choice. For obvious reasons, this jutsu has no effect on enemies in the air. This jutsu also affects allies.	27	21	27	0	22	0	0	0	0
886	7	7	Stone Body	Ishi no Karada	Stance: None	4	1	4	Kiretsu Kire (Fissure Chop)Description: An attack that is as a follows, first sending the dominant hand into the air followed by the leg that matches with that arm (ie right arm and right leg) the leg slams down first causing the ground to vibrate stopping any sudden movements and the hand slams down onto the skull of the victim.Bone CrusherDescription: A simple, yet devastating attack. The user grabs an arm or a leg. With immense power behind those fingers, the user crushes the bones within the fist, dealing immense amounts of pain and damage. This is usually used as a counter attack to punches or kicks. The user first blocks with a hand, then clenches his fist to deal the damage.Sky High AvalancheDescription: An attack reminiscent of both wrestling and the Omote Renge, the user first palm strikes the user high up into the air. Jumping after, then user grabs the opponent's body, flips it around so that the head is toward the ground, grabs the neck with his legs, and plummets down toward the ground. The attack can go up as high as 10 ft. While the attack isn't a 100% positive kill attack, it can cause concussions and injured backs and necks.	Double Impact FistDescription: A highly powerful technique that is also incredibly difficult to perform. Using the same idea behind Saido Nadare, the technique is, instead, used with one single punch. While this may seem, at first, to be impossible, with a high amount of training, it can be done. The user makes a fist, but then extends out the fingers slightly, almost like a palm strike. But instead of hitting with the palm, the user hits the opponent with the second knuckles of the hand. This is the first hit that neutralizes the natural defenses. The hand then collapses in on itself, to create a fist, a split instant after the first hit of knuckles. This collapsing in is incredibly difficult to perform, since it has to have the full power of a punch behind it to truly deal damage. But when the user masters this punch, it is an incredibly fast and powerful attack that nearly none can match.Ishi Suji (Stone Muscle)Description: A split second before the opponent hits the user with a taijutsu attack, the user tightens his/her muscles. Due to extensive training these muscles quickly take any blow that comes its way and returns the force back up the body of their attacker, effectively reflecting the taijutsu attack. A highly powerful technique, the strain this gives to muscles can be intense. Can only be used three times a thread.	36	27	36	0	24	0	0	0	0
885	1	1	Eight Trigrams Shaolin: Stone Fist	Ganseki Genkotsu Ba Gua Shaolin	The user is faster than a traditional genin who trains in other studies, but has trouble with any sort of stone manipulation. Envisioning the Ba Gua diagram as they are fighting is near impossible, and they spend most of their training merely memorizing each label for each area. Sidestepping is weak and rarely successful. Attacks are fairly strong, and sting fast, but leave no lasting damage.If the genin was to fight any opponent, he would most likely lose. His battle stance is weak, he forgets to attack, wastes space and time, and tires easily.	4	5		Name: Big Metal, Small Metal Lion StrikeDescription: A traditional attack, the shinobi places himself on the Big Metal section of the Ba Gua, aiming both palms at the shinobi. He spins downward and sidesteps very cautiously, showing his back to his opponent as he completes the spin and lands one foot in Small Metal, the other foot plants downward in the center of the diagram as both palms launch forward to catch the shinobi in the gut. A strong attack for such a low level user.The user continues to spin backward in a tight flip in order to avoid any counterattack.Name: Prosperity Forward Lion BiteDescription: Planting himself in the Prosperity row of the I-ching Ba Gua diagram, the user, channels chakra into his palms and legs, and rushes forward to the opponent. He feigns right and left as he runs, seducing the opponent into thinking he's going to sidestep. At the last second, as the user enters the center zone, he drops down and jumps straight at the opponent, bringing both palm backward and lunging them forward.This technique causes minimal damage, but is usually aimed towards noses or other soft areas, to maximize pain.		3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
885	2	2	Eight Trigrams Shaolin: Stone Fist	Ganseki Genkotsu Ba Gua Shaolin	Ok, so the user has a little more flexibility and a lot more speed. He's much faster than before, and much stronger. The Ganseki Genkotsu user still has yet to accomplish even the most minimal of stone bending. He can however, begin to channel his chakra into the ground, though at this level it would be a waste.The users strikes with all areas are faster, and harder hitting, but still nothing to be scared of. Often times, the user will trip himself as he sends himself into far away zones on the Ba Gua diagram, which can end a battle fairly fast, usually in defeat. The user tires after a few minutes of intense fighting.	4	5		Name: Mountain Water Snake StrikeDescription: The user stand in the Mountain zone, which is located quite some distance from the water zone. He waits for an attack, and sidesteps directly into the water zone, bring his fist to catch the face of the opponent in a swinging, circular body rotation. As he finishes the punch, he brings his second fist back around in another swing, following by body momentum, smashing his back of his hand against the same face.Name: Father Central Snake LaunchDescription: Another move in the Ganseki user's arsenal to deploy after an attack. After a horizontal attack, the shinobi drops downward on to father section of the Diagram, scooting forward on the balls of his feet. He then reaches one leg back behind him, dropping his fist downward, using the momentum of his swinging body. The attack is aimed toward the opponent's shoulder in the hope of dislocating a joint.		5	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	6
885	3	3	Eight Trigrams Shaolin: Stone Fist	Ganseki Genkotsu Ba Gua Shaolin	The first breakthrough in the Ganseki Genkotsu arrives here. The Stone nin can now began utilizing the unique chakra flow of the Stone fist style and begin conjuring the small squarish blocks of stone so well known in the style. Speed increases again, as the user begins to flow his attacks together into a continuing stream of attack.The user now begins to learn the three basic stances of the Ganseki Genkotsu Ba gua Shaolin Taijutsu, the user has memorized the Ba Gua diagram completely, beginning to visualize it perfectly, though focus is not as intense as later stages and students can forget their placing.Rock Size: Limited to about 8x8x1 inches. The square is about enough to block a single punch.Rock Strength: Blocking is the wrong word, absorbing would be better. The strength of the inch thick stone is laughable, barely sturdier than resilient cloth. It breaks after a single punch and absorbs barely, if any of an attack. Projectiles seem to have a tough time getting through, though.Rock Lift: Don't try and conjure a rock from the ground if you're in a heated battle. The speed at which it rises to the hand is slow. Usually taking about 2 seconds to completely reach the hand, those 2 seconds could be the Stone Fist user's downfall.Stance Name: Sliding Rock StanceStance Description: The only stance that allows stone manipulation, the Sliding Rock Stance is as intimidating as it sounds. One arm, bent ninety degrees, fingers open, is placed directly in front of his chest, the other arm outstretched behind his body, bent upwards, palm to the sky. One legs is bent forward, with about 40% of the weight resting on the front foot. The other foot, brunting most of the weight, is used for pivoting and sidestepping.Stance Name: Evasion StanceStance Description: The purely speed stance. The Evasion stance is a much less artistic stance. One foot is placed forward, one backward, the back foot holding 80% of the body weight. The shinobi's hands are open, relaxed and angled. One is bent in front of his face, as though he was guarding his teeth with his forearm, he arm extending backwards at an angle to the ground. This stance provides easy mobility, and excellent counterattack potential, but it's considered one of the weaker stances, since the awkward positioning of the body disrupts the chakra flow, meaning any stone manipulation is out of the question. This is also a tiring stance, since the user is normally running around the diagram at top speed, aiming his fast, but weaker punches towards any available opening.	4	5		Name: Fire Water Bear Kick (Rock Stance Only)Description: The first kicking attack any user of Ganseki Genkotsu learns, the Bear kick is a simple enough move to pull off for a user who trains with rotation. Starting in the Fire section of the diagram, the user swings straight forward, sidestepping continuously. As the user makes a 180 degree shift in location, he drops his foot out and aims to catch the opponent's leg.If successful, the attack more often than not completely knocks the leg out, crumbling the body support of the enemy shinobi. Only one with perfect balance could avoid falling. The speed at which the kick happens varies from user to user, but often time it suprises most chuunin. Jounin have some strange knack for sensing the attack.		8	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	8
885	4	4	Eight Trigrams Shaolin: Stone Fist	Ganseki Genkotsu Ba Gua Shaolin	The user's speed here is quite a force to be reckoned with. Even taijutsu specialists are hard pressed to match up to the Ganseki Genkotsu's speed. The user had begun to understand the limits of his own body, and as such, accommodate. Blocking moves is frowned upon at this stage, though in the Stamina stance, it is preferred. In combat, evasion is the key and the user is understanding.His flexibility is amazing, as he can now use his hands as extra feet if the need be. Though the chakra link with the earth is broken, the user, when in need, can cartwheel, walk on his hands, and perform handsprings to get out of the way of an attack, usually sweeping kicks.The user also begins to interpret enemy footwork at this stage. They read the enemy's body and plan attacks around where they know the opponent will move. They begin to isolate core muscle movement of the enemy and analyze possible courses of action.The Diagram is fully memorized at this stage and the shinobi often visualizes it with such clarity that it becomes a veritable hallucination. He can look down at the ground and actually read each label. In highly tense situations, often the words blur together. Strength increases in the traditional stance, as the muscles are in perfect line for attacks. Stone manipulation increases again, though the strength of the stone isn't anywhere near true stone.Stone Manipulation: 12x12x2. The stone's now are a bigger square and capable of being up to 2 inches thick, though a single hit will normally break through. The stone's can absorb the impact of any attack of 20 or less, but instantly crumble. Any strength over 20 will hit through the stone and continue as if it merely meet paper in it's way.Normally, Ganseki user's use the blocks to angle attacks away from them. They angle the blocks 45 degrees from the enemy's fist, forcing the attack to glance away.Stance Name: Sliding Rock StanceThe traditional stance is improving. Each attack is strong, and seems to glide across spaces to connect. Very flowing, the stone manipulation stance serves to train students is the hard hitting power they hold within themselves.Stance Name: Evasion StanceWhen the student is tired of throwing heavy punches, the Evasion stance awaits them. A heavily stamina based stance, Evasion serves to train the students in how to dodge and outlast an opponent. And they are getting quite good at this level.	4	5		Name: Wood-Chen Dragon Flight (Sliding Rock Stance only)Description: The user, sidestepping to avoid any attack, tries to get in close the center. Upon landing on the Wood section of the Ba Gua diagram, he spins in a circle, using any hands available to block attacks, upon reaching the Chen section, his right heel flies up in the air and crashes down immediately, bringing it's entire weight onto the enemy's head/shoulder/torso.A focused and damaging attack, if the opponent can sidestep, it normally proves ineffective.Name: General Stone Dragon BackupDescription: The first of the sneak attack utilizing stone manipulation, the shinobi pulls up a stone slab as soon as possible and keeps it in front of their chest. The enemy at this stage would normally have trouble seeing around the block.The user quickly spins once and brings his heel parallel to the ground. Using his centrifugal force, he launches his heel through the stone, releasing the chakra that keeps the stone together. The dragon kick, as well as a few sharp stone shards go launching toward the enemy. Capable of cutting skin with small cuts.		14	17	12	0	0	0	0	0	14
885	5	5	Eight Trigrams Shaolin: Stone Fist	Ganseki Genkotsu Ba Gua Shaolin	Fast. Very Fast. The speed at which Ganseki Genkotsu users attack now is highly defendant on which stance they are in, but nevertheless they are about as fast as any taijutsu specialist. Flowing moves and evasion take a huge leap forward. Sidestepping is now considered shadow tracing, since it's so smooth and fast, it looks as though the user is blending into his own shadow.He's not. It just sounds cool.The user is strong and fast, capable of attacking with any sort of leg/arm attack combination. The user has the knowledge in the battlefield to analyze enemy footwork, enough so that they can tell which way the opponent is moving, strictly based off their placement. They incorporate that knowledge into their attacks, luring opponents to step a certain way, so that they can counterattack with their own placement.The Ba Gua diagram is completely visual now, the user of this style is completely able to envision the circle with great accuracy and clarity. In fact, most of the time, the shinobi doesn't consciously know where each section is, they read it off the ground.Stone Manipulation: 14x14x3.Stone Strength: The stone is thicker now, and much harder to break through. No single attack can break through the stone, but it does crumble after any single hit, no matter the strength. Any chakraologist would say the physical interference disrupts the completely personal chakra signature of the user and the stone. It's a very person connection and any foreign chakra disrupts the flow, breaking the bonds immediately. The rock can not block against ninjutsu attack, only pure taijutsu and projectile (though if projectiles are placed with enough distance, the first can break the stone while the second flies through a second or two later.Stone Lift: Stone Lift increases here. Though not instantaneous, the rate at which a conjured stone lifts is very impressive. Opens sending chakra into the ground, the stone lifts out of the ground, soaring to the hand in less than the time it takes to perform a single punch.Stance Name: Sliding Rock StanceOnly a few have seen this stage. Highly regarded as the Jounin stance, the Sliding Rock Stance is even more fearsome now. Students and masters alike train in their hard-hitting, tree-blasting, boulder-cracking, blasts, utilizing their stone manipulation even more to suprise and destroy their opponent.Stance Name: Evasion StanceConsidered the female Jounin stance at this level, Evasion is fast, but very well-paced. The physiological placement allows shinobis to breathe regularly and maintain higher stamina levels then when in their other stance. The level at which shinobi can last is stunning. Truly an accomplishment.	4	5		Name: General phoenix Fire (Any Stance)Description: A very simple attack really, after any simple attack, the user adds an elbow smash to it. After a punch, he bends his arm and forces his elbow forward. The chance of blocking the elbow is much lower since the opponent is busy blocking the actual fist itself.Name: Global Daughter phoenix Tear (Sliding Rock Stance)Description: Another sneaky attack, the user conjures a large rock slab and launches it with chakra toward the face fo the opponent. The rock instantly crumbles, causing dust and particles to fly toward their face.At that exact moment of breaking, the user drops down and sets one leg behind the enemy's leg, directly against the shin. The user is now laying on the ground, he brings his elbow to smash into the knee, effectively breaking the enemy's leg cleanly at the knee. Quite dirty, this attack is very hard to dodge when visual acuity is low.		18	20	18	0	0	0	0	0	16
885	6	6	Eight Trigrams Shaolin: Stone Fist	Ganseki Genkotsu Ba Gua Shaolin	Strikes: Holy Crap, are you human? The speed at which the user attacks is tremendous, are one is hard pressed to find a jounin who can read his attacks. The user's muscles leave no telltale signs of when they are attacking. Fluid and fast come the strikes from complete stop. Sudden and vibrant, the attacks consecutively deliver forceful, damaging, and impossibly fast attack.Sidestepping: Yes, sidestepping at this point is near legendary. The user can predict the opponent's attacks well enough that they plan which portion of the diagram to travel to. Sidestepping requires little effort, and is quite fast. It is highly favored when fighting, as patience is a virtue in this cold stony taijutsu.Stone Manipulation: 15x15x4. The blocks are getting a bit more cubed now, as intense strength is added to the stone's. They are durable and hard; compact.Stone Strength: The stone slabs are tough and can negate the effects of a well placed punch. They last about 5 seconds before dissipating. The chakra flow stays intact throughout the stone now, which gives rise to the new durability. Rather than instantly crumbling, or even taking a while, some spectators of this style swear the stone takes second life, remaining even though it should be destroyed.Stone Lift: Fast. In the time it takes the sneeze, the stone is ready to block an attack and slam into the opponent's face. Less than a second is all it takes, it arrives ready to go as though a senbon was expertly thrown from the ground to the user's hand.Diagram: It's there, and it's staying there. The diagram at this point doesn't fade, though genjutsu could cause it to disappear (which could be an illusory clue in itself). It is ever-present and highly detailed. The user often will imagine the diagram while he is eating, or reading a book. The diagram is everywhere he is and it's a very hard thing to turn off at this stage.Stance Name: Sliding Rock StanceStance Description: Still the most powerful stance of the style. Not much has changed except for personal mastery of the stone bending.Stance Name: Evasion StanceStance Description: Speed is no longer an issue for the average Ganseki Genkotsu user. He rather focuses on absorbing and channeling softer blows into a perfect option for a quick kick. The quickness allows the user to break free of attacks and take few breaths. Regaining their lost air is integral to their training.	4	5		Name: Kan Ken Rooster Rise (Sliding Rock Stance Only)Description: Upon reaching the Kan and Ken section of the Ba Gua diagram, the user conjures the largest stone slab he can and positions it directly over his knee. He sends an odd chakra signal directly into it, weakening it directly in the center and raises his knee. His body is placed forward and under the opponent so that his knee hit's the target's torso, and launches a volley of sharp stone shrapnel directly into his abdomen.Name: Beige Education Rooster Evasion (Evasion Stance Only)Requirements: Must have kunai/shuriken in inventoryDescription: The user, in the beige position of the Ba Gua diagram utilizes his intense and amazing speed to turn up and over himself to avoid an attack. This is the only aerial attack in the entire taijutsu style, and must be utilized with projectiles. The user, upon spinning in the air, will dodge the attack and launch his projectiles straight toward the target. Not necessarily an actual technique of Ganseki Genkotsu, it is useful nonetheless.		24	28	23	0	0	0	17	0	19
885	7	7	Eight Trigrams Shaolin: Stone Fist	Ganseki Genkotsu Ba Gua Shaolin	Complete and Utter mastery. Not much is to be said except moves flow with the grace of running water while attack come as hard as the most solid stone. Truly a powerful level, the user utilizes his intense knowledge of his own body to counterattack with amazing speed and the utmost accuracy. His stances are perfect and his strikes, straight and true. The user is truly a fearsome sight to be held.Stone Manipulation: 20x20x4.Stone Strength: The stone's actually have veritable second life at this stage, able to absorb one attack of any strength without fail. Keeping the stone intact does require a hefty chunk of chakra, and physical stamina as well, which the Ganseki Genkotsu user doesn't necessarily have.This means one attack may be blocked, but at this stage, the cool down post to use a stone again is one post.Stone Lift: Blink of an eye. Instantaneous. However you want it, the user channels it, it's there. Still only one stone can be summoned at a time, but damn, does it come up fast.Stance Name: Sliding Rock StanceStance Description: Complete stone mastery and strong fluid attack. This is the ultimate level.Stance Name: Evasion StanceStance Description: Speed is not an issue at this level, rather the Ba Gua master refers to pure stamina to absorb and channel blows that they physically can. Nothing remotely close to the Decaying Fist style, the Evasion stance as this level is the ultimate in maintaining a top speed for quite some time.	4	5		Name: Qilin Shoulder Thrust (Evasion Stance Only)Description: A very simple attack, the user utilizes his incredible speed to sidestep an attack, and as a counterattack, launch himself full force at the user, shoulder blade first. Due to the expert positioning of the shoulderblade, the user is capable of knocking the wind out of the opponent for a while (1 post). A dirty trick, but effective.		32	37	30	0	0	0	19	0	25
884	1	1	Blade of the Life Spark	Myou Hibana Ken	At this stage the user has trouble even dragging their weapon correctly. Their weapon pops from the ground and usually ends up throwing their whole assault off balance. Using the Myou-Hibana-Ken at this stage usually makes the user more of a laughing stock then a warrior, but they are still more dangerous then the untrained.Blade Work- User's can bring their weapon above their head to bring it down for a heavy strike. At this stage they are letting the weight of the weapon do more work then their own muscles. Strikes are strong, but throw the user off balance when deflected or blocked.Spark Strength- At this level, the user cannot create enough sparks to even light the darkness. Their sparks are simply that, the sparks created as their weapon rubs against the ground, though their chakra is enough to make the weapon spark on any surface.Spark Life- Non-existent, the moment the blade leaves the ground, the sparks will quickly fade away.	5		4			4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
884	2	2	Blade of the Life Spark	Myou Hibana Ken	At this stage the user finally gets control of their weapon, their weapon doesn't pop up as often, and usually they can take the occurrence in stride. They are still easily thrown off balance by a deflected attack, but are quicker back to their assault, bringing more strength behind each strike.Blade Work- the user still brings their weapon from above, but now puts more of their strength behind it. This helps prevent them from flying back if deflected, and puts more pressure on the target to get out from under them or get stuck guarding. The problem is that the blade usually must go back to the ground after each assault.Spark Strength- Finally the sparks from this stage are bright enough to light a dark room barely enough to see. These sparks won't even be noticed by someone if they traveled off the blade and touched them though, only creating mild heat. When struck against a surface, the sparks ignite brighter, enough to light a room well, but nothing near a flashbang.Spark Life- At this stage the spark life is just enough to bring the weapon off the ground and strike. The Konken glows with the same florescence as the sparks, at this stage it's a dull red, and after leaving the ground will stay for a few second. This time cannot even be counted as a full post.	5		4			8	0	6	0	0	0	6	0	0
884	3	3	Blade of the Life Spark	Myou Hibana Ken	Stage three is the strongest a genin can hope to manage, and is usually the starting point for chuunin Konkaji. At this stage many of the initial problems like dragging the weapon, spark creation, and keeping the weapon steady, have all been removed. Now charging towards an opponent for a strike is more dramatic and intimidating due to the strong spark brought by the weapon.Blade Work- At this stage the user begins to learn to diversify their attacks. Instead of bringing all attacks above their head for the utility of the weight, now strikes are brought directly from the ground to the opponent's side, or any number of other strikes. Best of all, they can get in several strikes from different angles in before they have to bring their weapon back to the ground.Spark Strength- The sparks when the weapon is dragging are now enough to comfortably light a darkened room, though that isn't their intention. The sparks are noticeable, and at this stage the weapon takes on a yellow glow when sparks are being started. When struck against a surface, the sparks ignite brightly and are enough to spot the vision of anyone within melee range (usually the person that was intended to be struck by the weapon).Spark Life- Through the use of chakra, the user can finally maintain the level of sparks created for a whole post. The weapon continues its glow, and the sparks on the weapon continue throughout the post, dieing out just after. This allows more mobility and actions to be taken before the weapon is struck against the opponent or a surface.	5		4	Name: Early MorningDescription: Usually opponent's become used to the Konkaji clan member running in close to strike, attempting to ruin their vision. But at this stage, the disorienting light can be made bright enough to disorient anyone that sees the user if they strike a piece of their own soul armor. This creates a brighter flash and can be used to catch a clever opponent off guard.		10	0	10	0	0	0	8	0	0
884	4	4	Blade of the Life Spark	Myou Hibana Ken	Now developing into a devastating force, a Myou-Hibana-Ken user at this stage begins to create a difficult situation for their opponent. Standing under their strikes from the clan member at this stage will make it increasingly difficult to continue defending as their imposing strength and bright sparks make defense cumbersome.Blade Work- Clan members no longer find their weapon difficult to maneuver and now look to new ways to utilize their weaponry. While direct blows are fun, twisting, turning, or jumping before landing a heavy strike is fun. More then that, those that stay to guard against a blow will find themselves thrown off balance by the sheer strength of the Konkaji clans member.Spark Strength- The strength of sparks is increased yet again. This time the glow of the sparks is not the focus. Now when sparks ignite, the sparks start to cause light burning on those hit by the large spray of sparks that fly off. While these don't do much more then sting, constantly being hit by them are a grand distraction that a Konkaji is not afraid to take advantage of. Most of all it is dangerous to get these sparks in the eyes.Spark Life- Spark life does not increase here, still lasting only for a post before the sparks fade off of the weapon's edge.	5		4	Name: Sparkling SprayDescription: While dragging their weapon the Konkaji clan member stops abruptly and pulls their weapon forward. This causes a spray of sparks to be shot up into the air, and is a good way to catch an opponent off guard by spraying them in the face with the sparks. Is useful when going from a charge into an abrupt retreat.		16	11	16	0	0	0	14	0	0
884	5	5	Blade of the Life Spark	Myou Hibana Ken	The final stage a chuunin Konkaji has ever reached; this is the starting point for many of the most powerful Konkaji clan members. At this stage the heat is turned up on opponents again, the sparks going from annoyance to dangerous.Blade Work- The strength and speed at which a clan member can bring down their heavy blows increases dramatically. While usually blows are more methodical and obvious due to the dragging before hand, now the user has enough strength to increase the speed of their bladework to that of other taijutsu styles that commonly rely on speed of movement.Spark Strength- This stage of development in sparks is definitely a milestone. The weapon of the Konkaji glows a perfect orange while being dragged, and if it is looked directly at the brightness of it has been known to cause pain in the eyes. But once the weapon is brought down to strike, it shows its true power. An explosion of sparks bright white and painful to watch. While not blinding, this is very disorienting initially and leaves spots in vision for 2 post. After striking with the weapon, the spark ends immediately.Spark Life- The spark life increases again, the sparks able to be held on the weapon through chakra for 2 post. During this time the weapon is constantly giving off hot sparks enough to sting those that get close to it, but once it hits the sparks dissipate and it has to be dragged along the ground again.	5		4			20	16	20	0	0	0	16	0	0
884	6	6	Blade of the Life Spark	Myou Hibana Ken	Beyond the common caliber of fighters, this stage of Myou-Hibana-Ken is known to only a select few and even finding someone to train a fighter to this level is rare, most people finding the balance on their own. Their strikes are strong, their sparks are dangerous, and they bring the true heat of the forge to every battle.Blade Work- The rise in strength between this stage and the last isn't much, but the opponent will feel it more then the user. Enemies caught under a Konkaji's blade will find themselves being driven back with each blow they attempt to absorb, and the Konkaji continues pressing forward as if they haven't felt the impact of their swings at all.Spark Strength- As the blade drags along the ground now, the bright sparks created are enough to cause miniscule burns along exposed skin and black marks on fabrics. But most of all, the light created is enough to spot the vision of anyone who looks on it. Striking the weapon causes a spark bright enough to disorient and spot vision for 2 post. But more importantly the sparks at this stage are hot enough to cause 1st degree burns.Spark Life- The spark life does not increase here, still only lasting two post. But now using the sparks does not eliminate the spark life, allowing a bright blow to be brought down two post in a row.	5		4			28	19	28	0	0	0	20	0	16
884	7	7	Blade of the Life Spark	Myou Hibana Ken	Hot hot heat, the final stage of the Myou-Hibana-Ken, the styles zenith. The strength of the user is at a massive high, and sparks are everywhere. This is truly the life sparked from hammer, and brought to bear on all enemies of the Konkaji clan!Blade Work- The development in strength is now enough to throw a person off of their feet if they attempt to block a blow or take it. This increase is used in conjunction with complicated blade movements, moving a normal sized weapon with the skill and fluidity of a small knife for complicated motions before landing a strong strike.Spark Strength- The dragging sparks alone of a stage 7 Myou-Hibana-Ken user are enough to blind those that witness them. The sparks do not have this brightness always, but sporadically as the weapon is dragged into battle in a defiant charge. Just watching the sparks as they are dragged has been known to cause spots in vision for a post. But bringing the weapon to strike is now bright enough to blind someone for one post, and the large array of sparks cause 1st degree burns. But after striking with this powerful strike, the weapon cannot carry sparks again for 2 post.Spark Life- The spark life increases even more. The weapon glows white hot while the sparks are retained, shooting the blinding light everywhere. This spark can now be retained for 3 post. But still ends after the strike is landed.	5		4			38	25	36	0	0	0	25	0	19
883	1	1	Magnetic Fist	Jishaku Genkotsu	The user of the magnetic fist learns to move with speed and alacrity to best use their mastery of magnetism and thus learn to clear obstacles and close the distance between them and their targets so that they may make use of their abilities to bring the fight to a finish.The user can detect all metal objects within five feet of their person, indicating them to the user's sensors as a direction away from their bodies. As such while they are aware of the presence of metal and could point a finger at it they cannot be certain exactly how far into the field the metal is without collaborative aid from more natural senses.		3			Electric Spike StrikeThe foundation of Magnetic Fist, in order to use Electric Spike Strike the user must hold up their hand in the direction they want the shot to go. Electricity sparks along their hand and shoots forward in a jagged arc from their hand toward the target. It may only reach as far as the user's field, after which it dissipates into useless static at most.Base: A startling jolt enough to cause a sudden, mild contraction where it strikes.Stage Two: An intense electrical shock that can cause extended convulsions where struck, sudden nausea and a splitting headache.Stage Three The jolt can cause a convulsion in the limb struck, deadening its nerves and rending it paralyzed for about two posts.Magnetic RetrievalMore of a simple parlor trick than anything else. Coursing chakra through his electric field the character can focus on any metal item that is no bigger then 6 inches and is not moving of its own force and can slowly move it with his will anywhere in his field range. This jutsu has been used by enterprising Magnetic Fist users for everything from reappropriating fallen projectiles to opening doors without bothering to touch the knob.Stage Two: Three ObjectsStage Three: Five Objects	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	3
883	2	2	Magnetic Fist	Jishaku Genkotsu	While the Jishaku Genkotsu user's expertise lies mainly in the manipulation of their magnetic field they understand the importance of bettering their body so that they can both escape danger and bring their strength to bear against their enemies. The user is experienced with vaults and leaps designed to close the distances, but their blows are quick and light, designed by the makers of the style under the assumption that the strength of the blow will be provided by electrical charge.Their field has expanded in size and purpose. It extends ten feet out from their person and if any metal or electromagnetically charged objects (including human bodies) breaks through the border of their field they feel a sudden jolt up their spine. This does not warn them as to exactly where the object is coming from, but it does make them aware that something has penetrated their field. Strangely enough, the border of another Jishaku Genkotsu user's field counts as such an object.		3			Magnetic LevitationThe user, pulling his magnetic field into his body and channeling it through the his feet, finds himself hovering about an inch above the ground itself. Furthermore, in this state the user is able to jump quite high, and his movement becomes more fluid, capable of dodging attacks and sliding around the battlefield as if on a bed of ice that is completely under his command.	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	7	7
883	3	3	Magnetic Fist	Jishaku Genkotsu	Now the user begins to truly thrive, their movements taking on the natural grace of one dedicated to motion. While clumsy by the standards of more traditional taijutsu specialists the user is limber and free in their movement, adept at flips, cartwheels and simple sprinting. By the standards of most domestic non-shinobi they have become the equals of a competent street acrobat. With training their field has grown to fifteen feet in radius within which they make use of all their senses.		3			Magnetic DisarmThe user, if he gets his hand within 6 inches of an opponent's weapon (which must at least have some metallic component) may focus the magnetic field in his body in order to grab and yank the weapon away. At best, if the target's grip on his weapon wasn't at its strongest, this technique will successfully pull the weapon out of the target's hands, and toss it aside, but even at worst it can still be effective, yanking the opponent's weapon to one side, causing him to break his stance.Magnetic RushUsing their field to seize hold of the earth's magnetic field, the Jishaku Genkotsu user can rush forward, floating just above the ground as they ride over the planet's magnetic field, traveling between two points in a straight line with speed enough to make their movements seem a blur to outside observers. While it can lead up to an attack, Magnetic rush cannot be used as part of an attack as the movement simply requires too much focus. They can rush to any point within their field assuming that there is nothing blocking their path. Using this to dodge an attack counts as a kawairimi usage and cannot exceed them.	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	10	10
883	4	4	Magnetic Fist	Jishaku Genkotsu	When the user moves they dart surefooted and swift from perch to perch. When in combat with an enemy they aim to keep them at a balance, just within the range of their field out of range of enemy melee attacks and strike from afar. A magnetic fist user's focus is on hitting rather than hitting hard, and if their education is complete then that is really all they ever need. Their field extends twenty feet around their body, furthering the reach of their senses that much more.Their senses refine in detail as well as range, as the user can now also tell how close the objects they sense are to their own body. This is an inexact sense formed from imprecise readings in away the human mind is not trained to work, and so they only have a vague sense of whether the objects are closer to the edge of their field or the center.		3			Electric Surge StrikeRequirements: Electric Spike StrikeAn expanded and improved version of the Electric Spike Strike, Electric Surge Strike has the power to finish a fight. The user holds out their hand in the same manner, electricity dances along their arm and flashes forward from their hand. If hit the lightning dances over the target, coursing through their entire body.Base: Surge Strike causes a sudden intense convulsion in a body, disrupting whatever they were doing and usually sending them to their knees and out of breath.Stage Five: Electricity runs wild over the target's body and sticks with them even after they fall, leaving them twitching, sparking and out of commission.Magnetism ArmorIn drawing the magnetic field into his body, the user is able to amplify it. This condensed, strengthened magnetic field is a fantastic defense, deflecting all non-chakra enhanced projectiles sent at it. It's even powerful enough to stop ninjutsu of stage 3 or lower dead in their tracks. The user is able to move around normally while this technique is active, but he cannot use any other technique from this list. Magnetism Armor can be maintained for 3 posts, or canceled at any point before that limit is reached.Stage Five: Blocks stage fourField DampenAn improvised technique invented to aid in the hunting of missing-nin, Field Dampen allows the user to utterly erase their field's presence, making it impossible to detect. It was soon discovered that this technique could throw off other supernatural tracking techniques available to most shinobi and became a vital tool to both sides of the battle in the civil war and has come into common circulation since. No other magnetic fist techniques or senses can be used while it is active as they would disrupt the dampened field.	0	14	0	0	0	0	14	15	14
883	5	5	Magnetic Fist	Jishaku Genkotsu	The user's movements are smooth, swift and natural. They glide gracefully and deliberately over the ground with a smoothness that doesn't seem to fit with their actual speed. A user of Magnetic Fist at this level usually releases their speed in bursts, moving from slow glide to sudden rush to take their opponents by surprise. Their movements are beautiful and dance-like, especially when buoyed into the air by their magnetic force.With their growth the Jishaku Genkotsu user can now change their field and focus on detecting the electrical pulse that exists in the neurons of living things, that tells the heart to pump and mind to think. This technique allows the user to sense living beings in the same manner that they sense metal, and gives them new and powerful insight on battlefields against multiple opponents and making the user of Magnetic fist very difficult to surprise in general.		3			Cloud's SpearWith this technique, the user can use their magnetic field to propel a metal object in their hand (that can be no heavier or larger than a kunai) to extremely high velocities. It is surrounded in a bright halo of light from crackling electrify and shoots in a straight line from where they throw, bursting through any and all mundane obstacles within the user's magnetic field with terrible ease. Once it leaves the user's magnetic field, the projectile is still moving at horrible speed but its momentum is no longer reinforced by the user's power.	0	16	0	0	0	0	18	19	19
883	6	6	Magnetic Fist	Jishaku Genkotsu	As they approach the pinnacle of Jishaku Genkotsu's strength the user's field widens further, twenty-five feet away from the user in all directions. Many esteemed shinobi have come this far and happily retired with a storied career and more realistic dreamers consider this to be the level of skill to aim to reach and miss. They are slippery and difficult to get a bead on even without aid from the style's extranormal faculties, and with them the user can react to incoming threats with an awareness that can give them the edge.		3			Shrapnel BombA particularly brutal and deadly technique, the user finds and draws to himself about 10 chunks of metal, comparable to kunai, from anywhere around him. They could even be a little bit under the ground, like an iron ore deposit, but not terribly deep. These random chunks of metal float near the user until they are launched at any point within the user's magnetic field, but not particularly fast. Once a chunk of metal gets close to the target, even if he dodged, the user channels an incredible magnetic force through the metal, ripping it apart like a grenade, except with no explosive force. Instead, the result is dozens of shards of shrapnel that will easily wound any opponent foolish enough to be within 5 feet of any of the makeshift projectiles when they're ripped apart. One last feature of this technique is that not all of the metal chunks have to be sent at once. They can be launched one after another, and this can even be extended to last through the user's next post. So, someone using this technique could send 3 chunks the post that it is used, and then the remaining 7 next post.	0	18	18	0	0	0	25	25	25
883	7	7	Magnetic Fist	Jishaku Genkotsu	The way that the master Jishaku Genkotsu moves is like mercury rolling out of a jar onto a table; supple, effortless. They move through battles with bodies that have forgotten what it means to be trapped by the pull of the earth, and they move through the battlefield like a quick, creeping nightmare. Their field has expanded further, reaching thirty feet, and the wielder of magnetic fist is now keenly aware of the precise positions of everything that they sense within the field.		3			Aerial MagnetismThe user turns their magnetic field to another purpose, seizing the earth below their feet or any nearby suspended metals. They can push themselves off the ground, propelling themselves into the air where they have complete freedom of movement at their regular speed. They may float freely as long as either the earth or some form of metal affixed in place is within their field, using it as an anchor from which they may use this technique. Aerial Magnetism lasts three posts before it either ends or must be refreshed. No other techniques from this list may be used during this time and the user can only sense metal	0	22	22	0	0	0	33	33	33
882	1	1	Mandate of Heaven	Tentou no Sashizu	Sword Dexterity: The shinobi knows the basics, and won't be accidentally dropping his/her swords any time soon, but this level of skill is a far cry from the agility of higher stages.Unarmed Ability: Again, the user isn't clumsy, but the best tactic available if disarmed is to throw a punch to try and catch an opponent off guard, simply through the fact that a typical opponent would not expect a disarmed swordsman to still be able to fight.Footwork: A user at this stage knows more theory than he/she is capable of applying. They'll do fine, but on steep slopes or heavily rocky terrain, the user is at a disadvantage.	3	3	3	Double-slashThis consists simply of swinging both swords horizontally in opposite directions. The user can charge beforehand, or perform the attack from a standstill.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 2, Control 2Bushi no Kanroku (Presence of the Warrior)Uses chakra to shine reflected light out of one of the swords directly at the opponent's face momentarily. It doesn't matter if there is an actual light source around; the sword acts as if it is reflecting a light regardless. At the moment the opponent is distracted, the user strikes the opponent on one side of his body or the other, usually the lower sides or shoulder regions. The technique is more annoying than anything, as speed is required to pull it off to completion. The light hitting the target's eyes, while bright, doesn't last for long, though it does leave a spot on his or her vision.	0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
882	2	2	Mandate of Heaven	Tentou no Sashizu	Sword Dexterity: The user has now gained the skill needed to acutally be competant with his weapons, however, his footwork is still not up to snuff, so attacks are still a singular effort, without the ability to chain attacks together.Unarmed Ability: As with Sword Dexterity, some minor skill has been gained as far as time between loss of weapon and an unarmed attack, but it still has a clumsy feel to it.Footwork: There hasn't been much of a gain over stage 1, since the user has only really improved his or her sword dexterity and unarmed ability.	3	3	3	Vice PinchFor this, he user holds both swords our from his body, but pointed forward, and then immediately after, the swords are thrusted forward in an arcing motion (with the arms staying straight), almost stopping each other when the tips meet. Instead, the one blade slides on top of the other. If done properly, the target will experience a sword piercing him from two different directions.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 4, Control 4Bushi no Kensei (Diversion of the Warrior)This technique is an upgrade to Bushi no Kanroku. For it, the user molds chakra into his swords, and causes them to shine very brightly at the target (as bright as a floodlight), but instead of being a constant light, the swords now strobe, flicking on and off in a constant, very rapid pattern. This both distracts the target and makes it difficult for him to see, though it doesn't bother the user. The technique can last for a maximum of 2 posts.	0	8	6	0	0	0	6	0	0
882	3	3	Mandate of Heaven	Tentou no Sashizu	Sword Dexterity: A big step up, as fluidity has now been attained in all areas. Truely, the user is now a disciple of Tentou no Sashizu.Unarmed Ability: Again, a measure of grace has been gained, the user now able to competantly attack, even while still armed.Footwork: The key to the improvements here, giving the user the grace to start a couple attacks together at a time.	3	3	3	Roundhouse KickConsidered a fairly basic unarmed technique, the user pivots about on one foot rapidly, planting the other one directly into the target's chest.InterceptionAt this stage, the user has the skill to deflect up to two small projectiles, by knocking them aside with the swords. This can only work if the projectiles were simply thrown and not part of a ninjutsu.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 7, Control 7, Reserves 6Yaiba no Kanroku (Presence of the Blade)Here is Tentou no Sashizu's first true electricity-based attack. The user charges his swords with a fair amount of electricity, and they show it, crackling and glowing , even having bolts jump between the weapons. The effect is that the target recieves a painful jolt of electricity each time he comes in contact with them, however, the electricity gathers closer to the tip of the sword when the user slashes or thrusts, so even if the target comes within about a foot of the tip of the sword, he'll still recieve the painful electric shock. This technique lasts for 3 posts.	0	12	8	0	0	0	8	0	0
882	4	4	Mandate of Heaven	Tentou no Sashizu	Sword Dexterity: Fluidity and grace define the user's dexterity now. Able to spin his swords about and chain several attacks together.Unarmed Ability: There hasn't been much improvement in this area over the previous stage, thanks to the concentration on footwork and dexterity.Footwork: The user can now quickly adapt to different kinds of terrain, and is no longer hindered no matter what he is fighting on.	3	3	3	Fake-outThis technique takes advantage of the boosted speed that the user now has. He spins his blades about, as if preparing for a sword strike, but then, the user suddenly swings out with a high kick to the side of the target's body.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 10, Control 10, Reserves 8Bushi no Ikaku (Intimidation of the Warrior)The user crosses his swords into an 'X' in front of him, parallel to the ground, and pulses his chakra through them, causing the formation of a semicircular electric field around both. The result is a complete defense against all Ninjutsu or Taijutsu attacks of Stage 3 or lower. This only works in the direction the user is facing, and the field has an effective radius of about half a meter in any forward direction. Physical attacks are stopped at this distance, as if they had hit a solid wall. This can last for a maximum of 2 posts.	13	16	14	0	0	0	14	0	0
882	5	5	Mandate of Heaven	Tentou no Sashizu	Sword Dexterity: The dexterity of this level has only improved a little over the previous stage.Unarmed Ability: The user's unarmed attacks are now elegant and beautiful in their own way. Unarmed attacks are now often thrown in alongside sword attacks, without breaking the fluidity of motion.Footwork: The user's footwork has gained more grace, and he no longer even gives conscious thought to how his feet are moving. At this stage, the user becomes far more likely to dodge an attack rather than block it.	3	3	3	Triple StrikeThough the name sounds similar to the most basic technique of the style, it is far from it. The user initiates this technique with a roundhouse kick, but this one is angled upwards, in order to launch the target off the ground, which is exactly what happens. As the target is in midair, the user leaps at him and performs a double-slash immediately followed by a kick to the gut, pushing the opponent back downwards. Finally, the user points both his swords down at the target and lets gravity take over from there.	Special Techniques Requirement: Power 15, Control 15, Reserves 13Yaiba no Yobigoe - (Call of the Blade)In this technique, the user charges his blades with a great deal more electricity than in Kanroku no Yaiba. The user follows this by swinging his swords in a flurry of motion, and with each swing, a powerful bolt of electricity comes off of the tip and speeds towards the target. A total of ten or so bolts are produced in this way, and if 4 or more hit directly, the target is debilitated, their movements slower for 2 posts. These bolts, even if they miss, can still have an effect. Each has a radius of about 6 inches around the point of impact, in which the target can still be electrocuted, however it is impossible to hinder the opponent's movements in this fashion. This attack can be sustained for a second post, launching another ten bolts, but this will give the technique a 2-post cooldown. If only 1 post is used, a 1-post cooldown will be in effect instead. The effective range of this technique is about 15 feet.	16	20	17	0	0	0	16	0	0
882	6	6	Mandate of Heaven	Tentou no Sashizu	Sword Dexterity: The user is now a wonder to behold, and chains of attacks can go on for quite a while, the user looking as if he is dancing to the death of his enemies.Unarmed Ability: The user can precisely aim his unarmed strikes now, as well as he can his sword strikes. It's not unusual to see a user of this taijutsu hit with the hilt of his sword in a place that had already recieved an injury.Footwork: Moving this way and that, the footwork is now utterly unreadable. Not because of any fake movements of the user, but rather because of how smoothly they transition from stance to stance.	3	3	3	Spinning JumpHere, the user quickly jumps into the air at the opponent, curling into a ball and spinning about, with swords extended so that they spin perpendicular to the ground. The user arcs over the target's head in this fashion, but lands only a few feet behind the target. The momentum from the landing is then transferred into a roundhouse kick that is delivered to the opponent's back.	Special Technique Requirements: Power 19, Control 19, Reserves 18Yaiba no Saisoku - (Demand of the Blade)For this brutal technique, the user points both his swords at the opponent, charges them with a great amount of chakra, causing a fast bolt of electricity to fire out, although it stays connected to the swords themselves. This bolt, if it hits an opponent, no matter where, will pierce him/her, although it's only about twice as thick as a senbon, so not much damage is done from that, however it does discharge very painful jolts of electricity when it hits. Immediately after the initial piercing, the bolt wraps itself around the target, getting a firm grip (at this point, it's no longer giving off electric shocks). The user now has the ability to throw the target around, as if he was on a rope. However, the user can only toss the target once per use of this technique (e.g. I attack, it connects and wraps around, and then I fling my target into a boulder to his left. Technique now over.). The target may be thrown in any direction by whipping or pulling on the swords, however, the user's Strength + Power must be greater than the opponent's Strength + Willpower for the technique to actually be able to throw someone. Finally, this technique has a range of 15 feet on the initial grapple.	24	27	24	0	0	0	18	18	0
882	7	7	Mandate of Heaven	Tentou no Sashizu	Sword Dexterity: A master of the Tentou no Sashizu's swords are a blur of motion, never stopping their fluid and deadly dance until the opponent is dead. It almost seems as if the entire battle was of one attack, due to how smooth the transition is between them.Unarmed Ability: Unarmed strikes are now thrown in without the slightest change in stance, and they have some good power behind them now, too.Footwork: The user's feet are nible and allow for dodging of attacks that looks so fluid, one could be tricked into thinking that the attack was predicted and incorporated in the user's string of attacks.	3	3	3		Special Techniques Requirement: Power 26, Control 25, Reserves 24Tentou no Sashizu - (Mandate of Heaven)The culmination of this taijutsu's power, this technique is both beautiful and terrible to behold. The user charges his swords with a tremendous amount of chakra, and stabs them into the ground. From the swords, something bright and blindingly fast speeds its way along the ground until it reaches the target. Upon contact, the target's ankles are lashed together by what could only be described as a glowing circle of electricity. An instant later, the bolts travel through the target's body, forces his arms straight outward to either side, and another glowing circle appears around each wrist. From each of the circles, a bolt of electricity stabs into the ground and lifts the target into the air to a height of around 10 meters. The user then points his swords at the target's chest, the tips overlapping exactly so that there is one point between them. After this, there is a strike of lightning. No observer can be sure whether the swords made it, or whether the heavens answered the call of the swords and struck, but this much is certain: the target is pierced by the lightning, through the chest. The bolt has one end at the tips of the swords, arcs through the target's body, and ascends into the clouds. There is no piercing wound caused by this technique, and once the lightning strikes, the technique is over, and the target's body is released from its hold. However, the target is either instantly killed by this, or, if he is very, very lucky, paralyzed for the rest of the thread. The user also pays a heavy price, being unable to use any kind of chakra for 2 posts afterwards.Note: The chance that the target has to evade this technique is the initial capture attempt. This attempt takes up one post, and then the attack follows in the next post if the capture was successful. The first post would consist of the target's ankles and arms being restrained, and the second would be the lifting into the air and the bolt of lightning.	31	36	32	0	0	0	22	22	0
881	1	1	Ingakankei Taijutsu	None	Lifting Ability- Just barely starting out in learning the style young clan members find themselves using more of their strength in keeping the weapon lifted and being able to swing it then actually being able to move.Swinging Strength- The user swings the weapon with all of his might, but overall getting hit in this stage it just hurts, nothing gets broken, nothing gets dented, it just hurts.Balance- Generally when one swings the heavy blunt weapon around they tend to lose their footing and in return stumble around before being able to lift the weapon again.	5	4	d	Horizontal Swing- More or less a horizontal swing, either going from right to left or left to right. The idea behind a good hit using a blunt weapon is to hit the target with the head of your weapon, which is designed with a number of spikes or some other metal set-up causing damage to whatever it hits guided by the strength of the user.Overhead Swing- A much more difficult move to perform in the earlier stages. It is pretty much a swing that sends the weapon over the combatant's head and attacks the opponent from above. Very good to use to floor a person immediately, damage a helmet, or add some additional damaging force.		4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
881	2	2	Ingakankei Taijutsu	None	Lifting Ability- Having lifted and swung the weapon for a fair amount of time the ability to lift the weapon and keep it in position is less of a burdeon then it originally was when they first started, moving has also gotten easier as well. However the user is still very much aware of how much weight they are carrying and lifting.Swinging Strength- A swing hurts more then usual, swinging with all your might may cause small dents in something, or strip bark from a tree. However the inability to swing at a full arc causes a lack of overall force.Balance- Swinging the weapon in general is not a problem, it's stopping while not losing your footing that tends to bring a problem.	5	4	d		Requirements: Control 4, Reserves 4Name:A Little Extra Sauce[B]Description: An odd name? Indeed, but just as it means around this area of expertise an Ingakankei becomes able to tap and control their chakra to the point that they can use it to make themselves stronger. In that sense this technique allows an Ingakankei to use chakra to swing their weapons with more force then they are physically able to literally adding that little extra "oomph" to that attack that could be necessary to floor an opponent.	7	7	0	0	0	0	0	6	0
881	3	3	Ingakankei Taijutsu	None	Lifting Ability- As the muscles of the young Ingakankei become more developed lifting their weapon becomes second nature, and moving at a fairly decent speed while in a ready position is much, much easier. Sometimes to continue the gradual improvement in strength young Ingakankei will add donut weights to their weapons in an ability to help in excercising and also cause more damage.Swinging Strength- A quick swing in this stage hurts so much it could stop a person from fighting and ask what the hell just hit them. A full arc swing at this level hurts so much that the person will most likely not want to say anything if it hits them.Balance- Swinging the weapon and stopping in quick combat is not a problem anymore, but when one concentrates all their strength into one specific full arc swing it could cause a couple moments of stumbling, but the user should still be able to keep his weapon off the ground.	5	4	d	Arced Swing- Generally when one swings a wepon they are only doing so within their immediate line of sight, toward their enemy. However when using a blunt weapon the more force you swing with the more pain your opponent is inherently due for. So if one were to swing from an area that is not in their line of sight and in a very wide angle the force is technically more, but in return you have to apply more strength to swinging.	Requirements: Control 7, Reserves 7, Power 6Name:Touch of RaidenDescription: This Ingakankei technique is often mistaken for Nagare Isou no Jutsu, and it's understandable when you see the general ideas as both allow electrically charged chakra to course from the body to the weapon. However the Ingakankei technique causes the weapon to not only have electric properties but somehow makes the weapon lighter to swing around but does no actual changes to how the blunt weapon is felt. In comparison to power the technique is pretty much on par with Nagare Isou, it does shock a user, and it does hurt but more in the sense that it causes an interruption in attacking then actually killing someone. However in return for these complimentary attributes the technique causes the weapon to give off a very eerie blue glow that almost screams, "You don't want to get touched by this."	10	10	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
881	4	4	Ingakankei Taijutsu	None	Lifting Ability- By this point lifting and carrying around the weapon is more of an afterthought. This is generally when that comical look of little girls carrying huge blunt weapons start.Swinging Strength- Getting hit by this point it's no longer a question of if it hurts or not, but a possibility if something broke in the process. Sometimes blunt attacks hurt so badly that the friction and impact of the weapon can cause rips to the skin, causing bleeding. Armored fighters tend to put up a better fight as they require more force to be hurt or disabled.Balance- By this stage the character is able to fight well enough as long as they're standing. Fighting in a prone position is tough, so is jumping and attacking at the same time.	5	4	d	Spinning Attack- A full blow spinning attack using the blunt weapon. Considered to be one of the most effective ways to keep opponents way the Ingakankei grabs his weapon by both hands and swings his weapon around a full 360 degrees around him, sometimes more. Adept users can add an immediate jumping overhead attack to this making it a very dead combination.	Requirements:Control 10, Reserves 10, Power 8Name:Big ThunderDescription: Can only be done immediately after using Touch of Raiden. The Ingakankei swings his weapon overhead and intentionally hits the ground as hard as he can, the use of chakra into this attack combined with the sheer heat of the weapon causes a very loud thundering sound. Which can cause people who do not suspect it to occur to lose all forms of balance and equilibrium for 2 posts.	20	15	8	0	0	0	0	14	0
881	5	5	Ingakankei Taijutsu	None	Swinging Strength- Overall little has occurred when it comes to damaging an unarmored opponent, however when facing an armored opponent quick swings tend to put dents while full swings tend to put holes in it. It is around this stage that an Ingakankei becomes feared by most people who wear armor as they tend to quickly put holes in it.Balance- Ingakankeis at this level don't tend to fall easy, but are able to defend themselves with immediate ease besides the fact that they have been sent prone. In fact fighting prone tends to expose an Ingakankei to the toes of a shinobi and enables him to disable the feet. Jumping in while attacking is possible but very difficult.	5	4	d		Requirements: Control 15, Reserves 15, Power 13Name:Ride the LightningDescription: Following one post of charge time the Ingakankei swings his weapon in front of him and creates a large arc of lightning that propels itself forward. Anyone who is hit by this arc faces third-degree burns, 2 posts of stun damage, blackened skin, and major respiratory problems.	20	20	16	0	0	0	0	16	0
881	6	6	Ingakankei Taijutsu	None	Swinging Strength- By this point in stages unarmored fighters would find it in their best interest to run from Ingakankeis. Getting hit by so much power tends to cause severe fractures, skin rips, and overall pain. Armored fighters tend to not like fighting these clan members any better as even the quickest of hits can put dents and holes in armor while full swings may show that armor can be useless for protection.Balance- Ingakankeis by this level are at one with their weapon and can swing them in any way they see fit whether standing, crouching, prone, or jumping.	5	4	d		Requirements: Control 19, Reserves 19, Power 18Name: None Shall Pass!Description: Following one post of charge time the Ingakankei stabs his weapon into the ground, creating a a electric field around the weapon with a radius of 30 feet for 3 posts. Anyone who attempts to enter or leave this field faces third-degree burns, 1 posts of stun damage, blackened skin, and major respiratory problems. However the disadvantages are obvious, first the Ingakankei is disarmed of his weapon. Also the field can be disabled by removing the weapon from out of the ground.	30	26	19	0	0	0	0	21	15
881	7	7	Ingakankei Taijutsu	None	Swinging Strength- Unarmored opponents don't stand a chance against Master Ingakankei members, they don't necessarily die by the impact of their blunt weapons, but generally if they don't get the hell out of the way something is going to break to the point that they are not standing again. Armored opponents aren't any better the simple swings of an Ingankankei blunt weapon can cause armor to be turned into useless pieces of metal in little time, full swings still cause bone fractures and over-all unpleasantness.	5	4	d		Requirements: Control 26, Reserves 25, Power 24Name:Falling Pillar of HeavenRequirement: GM Approval, 5 Special Techniques in the Ingakankei TreeDescription: Said to only been taught to the greatest masters of the Ingakankei this aerial technique can sometimes hold a candle to things a ninjutsu specialist can pull. After charging his weapon for a post the fighter jumps high into the air and throws his weapon to the ground, causing a huge explosion of thunder and lightning. Causing major damage to any poor schmuck that happened to be standing near the point of impact.	35	35	29	0	0	0	0	18	26
880	1	1	Lost Warrior Art - 1000 Blades of Grass	Wasu Bukejutsu  - Kusa no Suusenken	The beginning, the start, the first step into Suusenken is relaxation and form. While they are capable of just charging in and attacking, it is usually practiced at this stage to hold back and defend rather then get your self into a bad situation. All the form and poses of Suusenken is already taught to someone that is at this point of technique as anyone who doesn't know the forms and stance cannot call themselves a Suusenken practicioner.At this stage of skill, those taught Suusenken are usually told to recite the name of their techniques when using them, a practice that always applies to duels between Suusenken users regardless of skill level.	3	3	3	Yurayura Saru-Arai (Monkey swings wildly)Description: This isn't so much a technique as a basic of attack. When coming forward towards a target the user swings their blade back and forth wildly while leaning into the blow. This is usually used to approach a target that will obviously put themselves on guard, as the attacks would do little damage even if they landed.Hayai Eda Kigen (Twig rises swiftly)Description: An early surprise for those that may not realize that their opponent is quite capable of hand to hand combat on top of sword combat. Twig rises swiftly is usually used to throw an opponent off guard, and amounts to nothing more then a simple sword feint. This feint then goes into a high kick that rises all the way over the user's head, catching most in the chin off not forcing them to move backwards.	Requirements: 2 Control, 2 ReservesTeikaiken (Blade that lingers in life)Requirements: NoneDescription: The basics of the chakra aspects of the Suusenken. This technique is ceremoniously began by swinging low with the Jian and cutting the grass in a circle around the user where the match begins. The grass is thrown up by the slice, but using haphazard yet miniscule amounts of chakra the grass is made to linger in the air. The blades seem to drift around the user as if they are caught in a breeze, circling around the person aimlessly. If grass is not available, many will create their own using the grass creation technique. Those with stage 4 or above grass ninjutsu can create blades of grass already floating in the air.No Iyagarase-Taezu (Field that Pesters constantly)Requirements: Teikaiken activeDescription: Most who are at a low level of skill in Suusenken need some sign that they actually have control over the Teikaiken technique. This defensive technique is usually the first technique they learn. By actively pushing all the grass to one side of them, they create a barrier of grass between them an someone approaching. Because the grass blades are so sparse, this will do nothing more then get into the eyes and face of the assailant. Each time this is done counts as a usage.	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0
880	2	2	Lost Warrior Art - 1000 Blades of Grass	Wasu Bukejutsu  - Kusa no Suusenken	Jouhanshin, the neophyte user of Suusenken has trouble going from the breathing and meditation of practice to the conflict that is combat. Jouhanshin is busting out, losing the defensive shell that beginners put themselves in by focusing on forward attacks. To make constant attacks that are constant and uncommitted, that is Suusenken. Even if an attack is blocked or misses, there will be another to follow it.Still at an early stage, attacks are still announced whether it is a duel or not.	3	3	3	Hina Ittenmen (Chick pecks face)Description: To facilitate the offensive focus of this stage, the Hina Ittenmen is completed. This attack is done by charging into an opponent and constantly poking the Jian directly at the opponent in a rapid fashion. An opponent who is constantly on the offensive can be thrown into a defensive mindset from this simple attack style.	Requirements: 4 Control, 4 ReservesItten-Senkou Kutsuu (Poke that precedes pain)Requirements: TeikaikenDescription: Finally learning how to move the lingering blades of grass, the user learns that their exaggerated movements is an easy time to manipulate the grass to follow. This technique, accompanied by a forward lunge or stabbing motion, causes the grass to fly forward and prick the target before the actual blow. The blades of grass grow stiff, but lack the sharpness to truly cut, and when the flurry of grass hits it can't be likened to anything but the sting of a senbon needle hitting. This prick even strikes areas covered in clothing, the few grass blades used in the strike becoming lodged into the fabric to become a constant annoyance.	0	7	7	0	0	0	0	6	0
880	3	3	Lost Warrior Art - 1000 Blades of Grass	Wasu Bukejutsu  - Kusa no Suusenken	An enemy without rest is an enemy with no counter-attack. The Jiten stage of training focuses to keeping a constant offensive on the opponent by using a mix of sword combat and martial arts. If your opponent is attacking, defend with the hand while you assault with the weapon. If your opponent is defending, then a mix of closed fist and weapon attacks will keep them defending. The 'Whirl' is about the 'spin' assault that is practiced at this stage, where the user alternates between attacking with the weapon and with their hands/feet to keep an opponent off guard. Sometimes this can take the appearance of an actual 'spin' where they turn their back on the opponent for a brief moment only to bring power to their next strike.Trainers no longer consider technique name announcement to be appropriate anywhere but in duels between two users of Suusenken.	3	3	3	Kaze Shibai Kekkou (Wind plays nicely)Description: The epitome of the Jiten stage, Wind plays nicely requires a specific movement to keep a whirl assault moving at a fast enough pace to even keep up with a back paddling opponent. By pivoting on one foot and using the other to facilitate forward movement, the three successive spins are made with each one ending with a backhand slash of the Jian. All this happens in a fairly short amount of time, but can be easily disrupted if there are multiple opponents.Neko Chouyaku Taku (Cat leaps high)Description: A simple attack whose only mention as a technique is because of the speed at which it is applied. Cat leaps high is began with a simple turning sweep, then if the opponent chooses to leap over it, it is followed up immediately by a rising slash as the user comes out of his low spin. If the opponent fell into the trap, they have little way to escape the slice that follows the trip. Though an interesting note is that doing just about anything BUT jumping over the sweep diffuses this attack, as will getting tripped by the sweep itself.	Requirements: 7 Control, 7 Reserves, 6 PowerInu Shibai Haaku (Doggy plays catch)Requirements: Teikaiken, No Iyagarase-TaezuDescription: This technique is lacking in power, but is considered useful for the pure fact that it acts as a range attack in an otherwise melee range style of combat. The user goes from a long range stance, usually with their sword arm arched over their head and pointing at their target, then slashes the sword down forcefully towards the ground. The primary effect is possible to be completely missed by the target, a minority (10 blades) of the user's Teikaiken field of grass is sent flying towards the target. The grass has been sharpened to a degree, and will strike like weak senbon needles. But the downside is that afterwards, the Teikaiken must be done again to get new grass.	0	10	10	0	0	0	0	8	0
880	4	4	Lost Warrior Art - 1000 Blades of Grass	Wasu Bukejutsu  - Kusa no Suusenken	To gain air, take flight to your enemy, and strike them down when they least expect it. The Hishou stage is the start of more dashing attacks, dashing forwards towards a target or moving through the air for some sort of attack. While it was always possible before this, the attacks used are simply airborne variations of earlier attacks. Now the acrobatic nature of combat is taken into account.Now rapid feats of foot and sword are made from above an opponent's, flying drop kicks moving straight into falling slashes.	3	3	3	Yottsu Odori Ude (Four limbs dancing)Description: This is simply a variant of the butterfly kick seen throughout martial arts styles. This attack is particularly dangerous when an opponent may be keeping track of the user's Jian instead of their feet. But using feats of strength, it is possible to begin the spin of the butterfly kick mid flight, allowing the attack to begin while on the fall from a jump.Kujaku Sentou Zatto (Peacock fights roughly)Description: While a rather basic technique, it is refined and is usually considered applied to this stage of Suusenken knowledge. From a more defensive stance, the user swings their sword forward and dashes forward with their blade leading the attack in a long bound forward. The attack isn't unnaturally fast once moving, but it is well targeted and the speed of execution and ground covered can leave opponents off guard.	Requirements: 10 Control, 10 Reserves, 8 PowerNagai Kusa Yotoginai (Long grass goes unwatched)Requirements: Teikaiken ActiveDescription: A temporary development that is used to take the opponent by surprise, this technique is usually used during a forward lunge to make it that much more dangerous. The lingering grass gathers quickly at the end of the Jian, extending the blade and keeping a similar sharpness as a basic sword. The length of the Jian is doubled within seconds like this, but the ruse doesn't last long and will fade back to normal Teikaiken after a post.	14	14	15	0	0	0	0	14	0
880	5	5	Lost Warrior Art - 1000 Blades of Grass	Wasu Bukejutsu  - Kusa no Suusenken	To go back to basics, a regression to the start, to return is to take all that you have learned and attempt to utilize it in new ways. A practitioner in the Henkan stage knows they are not a master, but now they are no longer focusing on new things, only on making what they currently know even better. While the style is usually about using momentum to facilitate strength, at this stage a user learns to use the strength they've naturally built up over their training to work over an opponent.	3	3	3	Raikou Dageki Sankai (Lightning strikes thrice)Description: An amazing acrobatic feat, Lightning strikes thrice is a mix of the earlier butterfly kick and sword swings. While rising into the Butterfly kick, the practitioner strikes at the opponent, then as they are coming back down and their backhand would pass the opponent, they swing with their sword, then a middle kick is delivered as the user lands. This helps not only deliver several attacks, but keeps the opponent constantly on guard during the attack so they do not get attacked while airborne.

880	6	6	Lost Warrior Art - 1000 Blades of Grass	Wasu Bukejutsu  - Kusa no Suusenken	For many, this is the end of the road, the goal. Medo stage is leaving the basics behind, and blending them together. This is no longer using them in new ways, but fusing them into whole new products. Every technique that was possible from a stable standing position is now possible on the run, on the defensive, from the air, nearly every attack can be adapted to new uses. The user has even gotten to the point of effectively fighting off multiple targets, his limbs and his weapon being able to divide focus to mount two different offenses/defenses. To many, this is what a master looks like, but a true Suusenken user knows the truth, and that there is still something that is beyond.	3	3	3		Requirements: 19 Control, 19 Reserves, 18 PowerKaze Henkashi Kai (Breeze picks up clippings)Requirements: Teikaiken ActiveDescription: A brash use of chakra befitting of a Jounin shinobi. This causes the lingering blades of the Teikaiken to swirl around the user violently. Usually combined with a physical assault, the long blades of grass have the velocity to cause rash cuts while they create a green-tinted whirlwind around the user. Anything, even allies, who move within a foot of the user, will catch many small cuts as if caught with the tip of a kunai's blade. These cuts can go through clothing but can't even phase metal based armor. This can only be used twice in a thread, but also has a 2 post cooldown after use.	25	25	25	0	0	0	0	18	18
880	7	7	Lost Warrior Art - 1000 Blades of Grass	Wasu Bukejutsu  - Kusa no Suusenken	Shuujuku is the end of the road, as such it is also known as Shuuryuu, the end. The Suusenken user is now what all other users hope to be, honed and powerful. In combat they are relaxed and calm, never faltering, as every technique they plan to perform has been practiced again and again, many times in real combat. They can attack and defend as one complete body, their sword merely an extension of their arm; they spin it with grace and attack with fury. Their attacks now utilize the maximum of their speed, strength, and dexterity. This is mastery.	3	3	3		Requirements: 26 Control, 25 Reserves, 24 PowerItten-Suusenken (1000 blades strike furiously)Requirements: All other special techniquesDescription: While many would consider a direct sword strike from a weapons master to be deadly enough, the Itten-Suusenken is the true danger. The attack is very deliberate, especially considering the usual unexpected strikes the style makes use of. To use the technique, the user must pull the point of their Jian back to their side, focusing chakra into the blades of grass that surround them. This grass clumps, forming 10 smaller kunai sized blades of grass. When the user brings the Itten-Suusenken forward to jab at an opponent, these blades move forward as well, and each grass blade has the sharpness to puncture even the strongest armors and ninjutsu stage 6 and lower. If this attack is not evaded, chances are the target will receive punctures of such depth and force that some limbs will be unusable or lost in the process. Once per thread.	33	33	33	0	0	0	0	22	22
879	1	1	Kinokozaku-Fu	None	At this stage, it is expected that the Kinokozaku-fu practitioner is mostly focusing on increasing their basic movement ability. Told to keep close to the ground, move fast, and aim low, nothing all that fancy has come into play. They have just learned the basic stepping techniques, possessing rudimentary knowledge of how to keep moving constantly to avoid enemy attacks. 'Duck, roll, hop, flip, turn on nimble fingers, crouch, somersault, dash, duck, roll, and so on are the basic commands that go through their heads. One handed feats are not possible.Psychedelic ManipulationAs far as spore use is concerned, the fighters are just beginning to understand the proper manipulation of chakra into the air around them. That said, their range is extremely limited, with the enemy having to come into actual physical contact with the user for any of the effects to take place. If by some chance, the Kinokozaku-fu student manages to graze the nose or mouth of their opponent, said target will begin to feel slightly dizzy. The effect will only last for the post immediately following said contact. If the user manages to hold contact for more than one post, the dizziness will still end in the opponents first post free from their grasp. None of the more colorful aspects of the mushroom effects have begun to come into play. Even with chakra, the spores are fairly impotent.		3				0	0	0	0	0	0	4	4	0
879	2	2	Kinokozaku-Fu	None	Now that the user of the taijutsu style has gotten the basics of dance down, they can begin to employ it more usefully in battle. Their steps are now solid, allowing them to crawl at a full speed equal to their running speed-all while performing dodge-rolls, somersaults, and other grounded twirling motions. Strategically speaking, they are now beginning to learn the weaker parts of the body to attack; not quite pressure points, but it is suggested that they attack places like the back of the knee, the ankle, the shin, and the diaphragm-only leaving their low-ground position for the latter. At this point, they can mimic the beats of music in their heads, allowing them to fight with nearly as much fluidity as they move while dancing. Dodges are beginning to lead perfectly into counter attacks, which in turn lead right back into another dodge.Psychedelic ManipulationLeading up to this stage, there is a greater focus on chakra manipulation in the practitioner's training, helping to make their spore control more potent and easier to do. At this point, the gas' range has increased to a foot away from the user's body. If it is inhaled by an opponent, they will feel two distinct feelings: the dizziness from before, as well as a new wavy feeling throughout their body (i.e. it seems to undulate). Worth noting: While the new effect is not enough to throw them completely off balance, it will make them slightly less secure about making movements that require perfect precision.The lengths of the two effects are:Dizziness: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureUndulation: Length of Exposure		3				0	6	0	0	0	0	7	7	0
879	3	3	Kinokozaku-Fu	None	Not much at all has changed between the style in the previous stage and the style in this stage. At this point, they are usually too busy working on improvements in many areas to see any noteworthy improvements in a single aspect. If anything, they will begin to experiment more with the infusion of their dance into the fighting, using more and more break dancing techniques as attacks. Kicks are more frequent, as are aerial maneuvers like front-flips and back-flips-both of which tend to lead directly into some form of a kick.Psychedelic ManipulationAs the practitioner continues their improvements of the shinobi arts, their handle on the spore manipulation follows in turn. The gas now retains its effectiveness as far as two feet away from the user's body. Upon being inhaled by an opponent, they will now experience three separate feelings. Again, the first is dizziness and the second is that of their body undulating; however, the third is entirely new. They will find themselves experiencing the world as if it was a teeter-totter, shifting from one side to the other. It can make many advanced movements extremely difficult to perform, most of the time leaving them with only the basics.The lengths of the three effects are:Dizziness: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureUndulation: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureSeesaw Earth: Length of Exposure		3				0	8	0	0	0	0	10	10	0
879	4	4	Kinokozaku-Fu	None	The dance is growing more and more fluid, with the users able to move on the ground easier than the average man or woman could move on their own two feet. Since the last couple of stages, the user has worked on their abdominal and upper body muscles to the point where the feats that they can perform seem almost inhuman. One-handed feats can finally be pulled off with enough ease where the user can wield the takegari while moving all over the place. Typically, people will begin to infuse the baton-like weapon into their acrobatics. At the same time, their studies have helped them to learn many of the body's most sensitive points; as has much training garnered them enough experience to successfully attack them in battle.Psychedelic ManipulationWith time and practice, the user of the style has now reached the midway point of the taijutsu's chakra component. Releasing their chakra into the air, they can now create a gas field three feet around their body. Most noteworthy of this level is the level of precision that they have reached-now able to discern enemy from ally, choosing who they wish to effect as they fight. If the opponent breathes the noxious air, they will experience four effects-all of which are based around aiding the user in robbing them of their balance. The first, dizziness; the second, feeling of undulation; the third, teeter-totter motions of the earth; and the fourth, simulated inebriation-blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, etc.The length of time that they affect the target is as follows:Dizziness: Length of Exposure + Two Posts After ExposureUndulation: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureSeesaw Earth: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureInebriation: Length of Exposure		3				0	14	0	0	0	0	15	15	13
879	5	5	Kinokozaku-Fu	None	Other than the increased physical capabilities, there has not been much improvement since the previous stage.Psychedelic ManipulationAgain, the user finds their progression in the manipulation of chakra to be quite evident. At this stage, their precision has reached the point to where the gas may be manipulated through any breathing apparatus of the enemy-effectively nullifying the items that otherwise might hinder the progression of the spores' effects. The gas will surround the user's body up to a distance of four feet. And, as seems to be typical of the style, a new effect is thrown into the mix as well. At this time, if the enemy inhales any of the spores, they will experience all of the previous four effects, coupled with a brand new one-a feeling of absolute bodily liberation: euphoria. Their own body becomes numb to them, they become giggly, as if being tickled over every inch of their body, and the world seems to be something entirely its own. They are their spirits.The length of time that they affect the target is as follows:Dizziness: Length of Exposure + Two Posts After ExposureUndulation: Length of Exposure + Two Posts After ExposureSeesaw Earth: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureInebriation: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureEuphoria: Length of Exposure		3				0	16	0	0	0	0	19	19	18
879	6	6	Kinokozaku-Fu	None	Nearing perfection, the user has now become a hurricane of the battlefield, moving about with so much random fluidity that even the most trained eyes have trouble picking up on and predicting where the fighter's next movements are going to come from. They are unpredictable, swift, and constant-the worst combination imaginable for more linear fighters. Also, at this point, the Kinokozaku-fu practitioner begins to learn and practice strategies for fighting multiple opponents. Dancing through any crowd of enemies, they will attempt to use the numbers to their advantage-ducking and hiding behind one person, taking them out, and then springing out to attack another. To properly understand just what they are capable of doing their bodies, one should have a fighter of the style run through an industrial facility that they have never seen before. With eyes trained to keep up at incredible speeds; bodies of ultimate dexterity, agility, and flexibility; and reactions perfect for dealing with the randomness of obstructions, they could maneuver the complex flawlessly.Psychedelic ManipulationPrecision hasn't taken much of an increase at this stage; instead, they focus mostly on the amount of gas that can be created and the potency of it. At this level, the gas will surround the user's body up to a distance of five feet. If inhaled by an opponent, it will force them to experience six effects. The first is dizziness, the second is the feeling of bodily undulation, the third makes the earth appear to move side to side like a seesaw, the fourth is mimicked inebriation (tipsy), the fifth is a euphoric sensation, and the sixth-and newest-is a cholinergic effect (lowered blood pressure and mild dehydration by heavy sweating and salivation). Mood swings are often prominent in those affected at this stage, as they are experiencing so many feelings at once. The length of time that they affect the target is as follows:Dizziness: Length of Exposure + Three Posts After ExposureUndulation: Length of Exposure + Two Posts After ExposureSeesaw Earth: Length of Exposure + Two Posts After ExposureInebriation: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureEuphoria: Length of Exposure + One Post After ExposureCholinergic: Length of Exposure		3				18	18	0	0	0	0	25	25	25
879	7	7	Kinokozaku-Fu	None	Kekona, having just reached this stage of the style, has deemed it imperfect. Beyond the abilities of the previous stage, it offers little more than precision. Things that might have been capable but difficult before can now be pulled off without breaking a sweat. In essence, this is the epitome of break-dance fighting. Flips, kicks, sweeps, handstands, headspins, Y-kicks, and the like are second nature. Hell, the fighter can walk miles in a handstand position while out of battle, so many often dream of what they could do in an actual fight-when the adrenaline was actually pumping.Psychedelic ManipulationThe final stage! The user has now reached the point of complete mastery over the spores. The gas can now be turned off an on like a whim, directed at specific targets within the area, and maneuver through the tiniest of cracks to reach a target. The area of the gaseous field has now spread to six feet away from the user's body, affecting anyone in the range that the user so chooses. All of the previous effects still come into play, but now the most powerful of them all can be released upon the enemy. The seventh and final effect will enter the opponent's body and target the muscles and brain directly. The opponent will find himself delirious-hallucinations calling out for him from every each way, confusion being prominent in his brain, lights flashing in his eyes where there are none, etc.-and they will find their muscles tightened up, taking away much agility and dexterity. It is a terrible feeling.

878	1	1	Hoshigami Taijutsu	None	Description: At this level, the practitioner of Hoshigami-ryu learns the basics of biomechanics. In short, he begins to learn the best ways to dodge attacks, utilizing his movement and natural flexibility to perform the most efficient evasions that he is capable of. The practitioner's speed increases slightly, as the training at this level consists of mostly reflex training, endurance training, and flexibility training. The basic attacking surfaces taught at this level are the palms and the elbows, and the basic grapples taught at this level are basic arm locks and hip throws.		5	4		Bunshin Kasou no jutsu (Clone Disguise technique)Requirements: Tactics 2, Intelligence 2Trigger: Must be within eyesight of targets.Duration: 1/3/6Description: The Clone Disguise technique requires the user to already have created clones through ninjutsu of some sort. When used, this technique swaps the appearance of the user and one of his clones at random, once per post for the duration of the technique. Obviously, this is only useful if the clones in question are not already exact replicas of the user.	0	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
878	2	2	Hoshigami Taijutsu	None	Description: At this level, the Study of Movement is complete. The pracititioner's body has been toned by constant exercise and his mind has become aware of not only his own movement but the movement of others. Attention to detail becomes second nature and evasion is reflexive in nature. The practitioner's knowledge of biomechanics allows him to use the right amount of force to achieve the desired effects. Training to aquire this level consists of evading practically every known type of weapon and taijutsu style whose practitioners are willing to train with the Hoshigami practitioner. Angles of attack are committed to muscle memory, and the mind is not burdened with analysis. The practitioner's speed increases, due to his extremely efficient movement and muscle structure.		5	4		Toorima no jutsu (Phantom Killer technique)Requirements: Tactics 4, Intelligence 4Trigger: AuralDuration: 1/3/5Description: The trigger for this technique is a loud clap, which the victims hear as a loud click. The Phantom Killer technique causes the targets (up to three) to see the user as an indistinct, man-shaped (or woman-shaped) mass that blends partially with the plant-life next to and behind it, and shimmers like quicksilver. This affords the user a small degree of camouflage when standing still, but the distortion of moving and attacking is great enough that the target can make out the user's form (just not the details.) The does not work in urban terrain.	0	9	5	0	0	6	0	0	0
878	3	3	Hoshigami Taijutsu	None	Description: At this level, the practitioner of Hoshigami-ryu learns the basics of the counter-strike. This involves attacking during an evasion, at the point where the opponent has committed himself to the attack and thus has less attention to his defense. Striking at this level consists of palm strikes, elbow strikes, and wrist strikes; grappling consists of various upper-body joint locks and throws. Because of the emphasis placed on movement the feet are never used for striking, though the knees are used occasionally to break down an opponent's stance and balance in preparation for a throw. Training for this level is much like the training for the second level of the style, save that with each evasion the practitioner attempts to retaliate. Basic attack angles are taught and practiced until they become second nature. Beyond this level, Hoshigami-ryu becomes a self-study taijutsu, as both advanced movement and advanced attack angles become dependent on the practitioner's own body and are thus unique.		5	4		Kusa Tegakari no jutsu (Trailing Grass technique)Requirements: Tactics 7, Intelligence 7, Willpower 6Trigger: Area of effect, 20 meter radius.Duration: 1/3/5Description: When the Trailing Grass technique is used, any movement from the user is followed by a trail of grass blades that reach as high as his head and extends down to his heels. This trail floats lazily in the area the user has moved through for the duration of the technique, and does not block sight so much as it obscures it the way a small cloud of grass would. The more layers of trailing grass a victim has to see through, the more obscured vision becomes. Obviously, this technique becomes more effective as more Akagawa use it in tandem, sowing confusion across the battlefield amongst their foes.	0	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0
878	4	4	Hoshigami Taijutsu	None	Description: At this level, the Hoshigami learns advanced attack angles, using the opponent's body as a visual block for his own strikes as well as attack angles that the body is not made to defend against easily. Such angles of attack have been committed to muscle memory at this point, and are executed without thought. With the Study of Striking mastered, the Hoshigami can now dictate the speed of a taijutsu battle, using joint locks and breaks to end an engagement quickly, or using unbalancing strikes and throws to prolong the battle. At this point, he also begins the Study of Heavenly Speed.An advanced study of Hoshigami-ryu; the Study of Heavenly Speed expands upon the study of movement and is the source of the surprising speed that practitioners of Hoshigami-ryu possess. Through the ongoing perfection of their movement and style, a practitioner of Hoshigami-ryu begins to learn how to use their body's capacity of speed to the fullest, making use of body type and muscular density to utilize every last natural drop of speed. It is an important to note that this aspect of the style can neither be taught nor copied, as it is more of a natural progression from the study of movement. It is also important to note that the faster the character becomes using this study, the harder it is to hide such speeds, and opponents will easily recognize the possibility for high speed that the Hoshigami has once he has attained level six in the Hoshigami style.		5	4		Fukusen Kagai no jutsu (Foreshadowed Assault technique)Requirements: Tactics 10, Intelligence 10, Willpower 8Trigger: AuralDuration: 1/1/1Description: Used either as part of an attack or as a distraction for tactical movement (retreat and other things), the Foreshadowed Assault technique is used to confuse a number of opponents at once. To trigger the technique, the user whistles loudly at a low pitch; to those affected, this sounds like wind whistling through grass.Each affected target sees the user move to attack them (they imagine the method, with the only restriction being that it is a physical attack), but the figure dissipates as it comes within arm's reach (until the figure vanishes, the user is masked from sight). If this technique is paired with an attack (the default usage), then one unlucky target will see his vision of the user dissipate only to have the real user burst through the shards if fading illusion to actually attack. If no attack is paired with the technique (tactical movement usage), then the user takes his brief period of invisibility to either start an escape or reposition himself.	6	20	17	0	0	14	0	0	0
878	5	5	Hoshigami Taijutsu	None	Description: At this level, the Hoshigami's speed continues to increase. Pracititioners of Hoshigami-ryu at this level have been referred to as speed demons; their ability to move and strike at high speeds making them ideal as assassins and advance scouts. Non-taijutsu users will have trouble in keeping up physically with a Hoshigami-ryu practitioner of this level, and Taijutsu specialists whose style does not concern itself with speed will also find themselves at a disadvantage (at this point, the character has at least Level 9 speed).Also at this level, the practitioner's skill in taijutsu has risen to the point that he begins to see the openings in an opponent's defense before the opponent attempts a strike. Until one begins this study, Hoshigami-ryu is most effective when it is reactive in nature; all of the movements and strikes come in response to an attack. This study teaches a practitioner how to strike before striking; in other words, showing a false opening and striking during the time that the opponent is considering an attack. The very nature of this study is deception, because it causes an attacker to consider an attack that is not viable. Ironically, this study is only useful against experienced Taijutsu users (Chuunin level or higher) because novices would not see such openings, real or imagined.		5	4		Soubou Kaihi no jutsu (Shadowy Evasion technique)Requirements: Tactics 15, Intelligence 15, Willpower 13Trigger: Vocal.Duration: 0/2/4Description: Enemies are affected upon hearing the sound of the user's voice (almost anything can be said, as long as the tone of voice makes it sound like a challenge). Any time the user defends himself against or evades an attack, a bunshin (of the illusionary sort, of course) steps out from his body in the opposite direction of the user's movement, and proceeds to take action (attacking, pretending to use a technique, etc). These bunshin fade when hit, or at the beginning of the user's next post, whichever comes first. Multiple defenses/evasions result in multiple bunshins.	10	26	20	0	0	16	0	0	0
878	6	6	Hoshigami Taijutsu	None	Description: Enlightenment sometimes occurs in the heat of battle, in the thrill of exertion. When a Hoshigami breaks through the barriers that limit his speed, and his mind gains a frighteningly clear view into where his opponent would prefer to attack, he has for all intents and purposes mastered Hoshigami-ryu taijutsu. The character's speed is rivaled by very few, typically taijutsu masters of a style that concerns itself with speed (at this point, the character has at minimum Level 11 speed). The character also undergoes several fundamental changes; side effects of his enlightenment that are seen as both a blessing and a curse. Firstly, a practioner at this level is easy to spot. Everything he does is just a little too fast, his movement (even outside of combat) a little too fluid. With this constant heightening of speed, the Hoshigami's body requires more nourishment.In practice, it is an offensive version of the Shadowy Evasion technique. When physically attacking, the user's figure blurs and then separates into 5; one real, four illusions. The five continue their attack, either all attacking the same target (in any order (clone, clone, real; clone, real, clone; real, clone, clone, etc). Alternatively, they can each attack a different target, or split themselves up amongst targets. The clones created by attacking do not fade away until the user's next post, but they also make no attempt to evade attacks against them.		5	4		Itsue Moukou no jutsu (Fierce Five-fold Attack technique)Requirements: Tactics 19, Intelligence 19, Willpower 18Trigger: Visual or AuralDuration: 0/2/3Description: The penultimate technique of the style, the Itsue Moukou is considered one of the two succession techniques of Hoshigami-ryu taijutsu. After completing the handseals, the Akagawa will adopt the adept's stance; both hands open and in front of the body, arms partially extended, a lowered center of gravity and a 60/40 weight distribution on the front leg. Additionally, he will state his intentions (which is generally a threat and can be anything from the overused cliche "Here I come!" to an apology, or even advising the opponents to pray to their ancestors. Basically, it is less of a challenge and more of a declaration.) Any who see the stance or hear the declaration are affected.	15	32	28	17	0	19	0	0	0
878	7	7	Hoshigami Taijutsu	None	Description: Few geniuses ever came out of the Hoshigami clan, but it was reknowned for its ability to produce extremely well balanced Shinobi. The highest level of advancement in Hoshigami-ryu reflect this goal of balance, requiring that no area of a Shinobi be neglected. Upon mastery of the physical elements of Hoshigami-ryu, the newly appointed master is given a copy of the manuscript containing the succession study, passed down from the last person to master the style. The new master learns the study detailed therein, destroys the manuscript, and then rewrites it for the next master of the style. The succession technique is as follows:In practice, the technique is an upgraded form of the Shadowy Evasion. Whenever the Akagawa defends against or evades an attack, 13 bunshin will step out of his position; likewise evading the attack in a number of different ways based on the Hoshigami style. These bunshin fade when hit, or at the end of the technique's duration, whichever comes first. The number of bunshin active cannot exceed 52.		5	4		Hidama no Moufu (Blanket of Falling Stars)Requirements: Tactics 26, Intelligence 25, Willpower 24Trigger: Visual or AuralDuration: 0/1/3Description: The ultimate technique of Hoshigami-ryu taijutsu. After completing the handseals, the Akagawa will adopt the master's stance; feet shoulder width apart, one slightly in front of the other, one hand palm-out and arm extended at shoulder level, the other hand palm down near the waist. Additionally, he will issue a challenge (usually something as simple as "Come!" but it can be anything the user wishes). Any who see the stance or hear the challenge are affected.	23	40	40	21	0	23	0	0	0
877	1	1	Glimpse of Eternity 	Hitome Mannen	To some called a dance, to others a style, the Glimpse of Eternity is above all else the coveted style of the Maseika clan. But at this stage, the user is only first introduced to the motions, called the ubuge in practice. It is literally all about ubuge at this stage, with striking barely trained or implemented.The subtle motions of the arms are all taught here through the first dance. The most basic and least refined, it is nothing more then the hands moved in conjunction away from the body, upwards, crossed, then back down, through varying degrees of motion. While basic in action, it allows neophytes to learn the basics of motion without getting their arms too far away to hit a target.	4	3	2			5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
877	2	2	Glimpse of Eternity 	Hitome Mannen	The first level of actual training, the Maseika at this stage focuses on striking. Among the many motions and patterns taught, there are windows of opening at each exact motion. During these times, there is a pattern for how to move the arms from the gentle flow of the ubuge to the stiff muscle strike of the nikui. A soft hand becomes a closed fist, and just like that the user is able to shove their arms forwards to strike a foe, usually aiming for the trunk of the body to do maximum structural damage.This is the start of formal training on how to move from ubuge to nikui, so while fast it isn't exactly '˜fluid'. The blows are close fist as noted above, the arms that are kept near the body during the Ubuge are extended for a punch before the user begins the Ubuge again.	4	3		Rei Bakushin - Zero DashThe Zero Dash is an all purpose name for the switch between Ubuge and Nikui. It is the term used to refer to the development of suddenly switching from deceptive motion to closing in on an opponent. The Zero Dash is never instant, but it grows ever more 'sudden' and 'unexpected' as the clan member develops in their abilities. To other users of the style, this full on run is recognized as what it is, even if the target doesn't have time to adjust to it.	Stat Requirements: 4 Willpower, 4 IntelligenceKouin Fusenmei - Temporal BlurThis technique is the most basic use of the Eiseihada. Using this technique requires only the most basic control over the clan bloodline. The user almost seems to be vibrating as the Eiseihada begins it magic. Whenever a motion is made, subtle after-images remain in that location for a mere second. This sight, these ghost-like images, are actually the variable forms of the user all being brought into our own dimension. They are not physical, but they do serve as a good visual obstruction. This can be maintained 1 post for every 4 points of Intelligence. After expending all the post, this and all other S.techs from this style cannot be activated. One variation is in effect for every 2 stages in this style.	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0
877	3	3	Glimpse of Eternity 	Hitome Mannen	The first introduction to flowing movement of the legs, this stage is all about motion. The second dance is taught here, this one including the arms intertwining, with occasional low stances and spins to keep opponents guessing. Evasion takes a leap at this stage, practitioners learning the different points to duck out of an attack, or disengage completely.This also introduces kicks to the style. While before the stiff attacks of the nikui were all based in the hands, now kicks of varying degrees are accessed. From rising kicks to catch an opponent off guard, to round houses for high damage blows. These are rarely utilized on a strong opponent though, as they can leave one open for counter-attack.	4	3		Tatsu - RiseTatsu is a basic combo that is first applied when kicks are fully developed. By using the deception inherent to the style, a clan member assaults an opponent with the appearance of coming in for a high attack, then slips low to rise up from below with a kick. While any sense of deception may be used for this, the most common is to use a variation in the first dance, who can appear to be attacking fully standing while the true Maseika slips down low.	Stat Requirements: 7 Willpower, 7 Intelligence, 6 TacticsKuteniiten - Stop on the pointThe first truly advanced use of the Eiseikougan. As the user blinks, the world around them seems to have stopped on one exact instance. The user can move around for a full 3 seconds (all contained in one post), but they cannot interact or even attempt to interact with anything. As this moment ends, the user is forcefully pulled back into the exact same position they started in, and time begins as if nothing had happened with them standing at the exact same location. This technique is usually used to study surroundings and situations regardless of how difficult the battle at hand may be. This technique draws on enough chakra that it can only be utilized twice per thread.	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0	0
877	4	4	Glimpse of Eternity 	Hitome Mannen	Now that the basics of motion are down, training moves directly to accuracy and countering. While Bakushin has developed greatly, bringing down an opponent who is strong on the offensive can still be difficult. At this stage, the user learns new stopping points for the ubuge-nikui transfer that bring strikes down hard at safe points on an opponent's wrist or ankles. Executed, this usually looks like a slight bound backwards followed by a fist strike to move the opponent's attacks outwards.Users practice for hours on end to perfect this action, learning how to deal with different assaults at every moment of the ubuge. As they learn about everything from weapons to grapplers, knowing different varieties of strikes makes a defender's arsenal complete. Of course there are ways beyond knocking an attack aside to block, attacks to the head, groind, or other sensitive areas that are exposed work just as well. The reason for knocking someone aside is simply to set them up to fall into an unguarded attack.	4	3		Shidou- GuidanceA simple name given to a proper parry. When knocking a blow aside the main hope is to pull an opponent in and throw them off their balance. This makes it so what was originally a missed attack turns into a disaster for the opponent. This can be done in a variety of ways, but usually the best are the most subtle. Knocking someone to the side to a degree that sends them clamoring for balance, or giving an extended arm a tug to 'help' someone fall forward.	Stat Requirements: 10 Willpower, 10 Intelligence, 8 TacticsKouin Kujiku - Temporal BreakRequirements - Kouin FusenmeiTemporal break is an advancement on the Temporal Blur technique that makes up the basis of the Eiseihada. Using this, the variations created in Temporal blur gain the ability to move further away from the Maseika clan member. For every 5 control the variations can move 1 foot away from the Maseika member. This also comes with the ability to make variations solid for a post, but this also makes them vunerable to physical damage (and with that dissapating and damaging the Maseika member.)	17	15	11	0	14	0	0	0	0
877	5	5	Glimpse of Eternity 	Hitome Mannen	The first stage that teaches nothing '˜new' per se, it instead advances all current skills. The ubuge motions are now smooth and effortless, the user seeming almost in a trance. While they circle an opponent, every motion seems sure yet pointless until it is far too late.The array of different attacks has also advanced, from just the hands and feet, to elbows, headbutts, every body part has different cues in the ubuge-nikui transfer points. While the hands and feet may serve the best and do the most damage, who knows when a certain strike may need to come from a certain angle.This leads to the third and final dance. It is the most complicated among, full of motions that would otherwise be suicide to complete when keeping aware of an opponent. Spins and acrobatic flips are all present, fast paced and fluid. Coming up from these feats can lead into low head butts or spinning into an elbow strike. This dance is rarely utilized in actual combat unless a Maseika or one of his variations needs to catch the attention of a target.	4	3			Stat Requirements: 15 Willpower, 15 Intelligence, 13 Tactics	22	18	16	0	16	0	0	0	0
877	6	6	Glimpse of Eternity 	Hitome Mannen	The user is becoming an overwhelming force on the verge of mastery. To some, this is the greatest they could ever hope to achieve, a blend of movement and power that would make even the strongest of fighters quake in fear. Foremost seen here is another burst in the severity of blows, leading many to question the usually docile nature of the Maseika.The few ticks of the Ubuge not mapped and trained for are being closed up; the user can now spend their time learning every strike in every dance as if they are second nature.Training at this stage takes on a meditative edge as well, mental study of every moment and every mistake helps perfect the styles few holes.	4	3			Stat Requirements: 19 Willpower, 19 Intelligence, 18 TacticsMannen - EternityRequirements - Kouin KujikuThis highly advanced technique is considered dangerous to both the user and the target as the Maseika clans member pushes their use of the Eiseihada beyond normal limits. As they close in on a target, the Maseika begins to vibrate wildly, then Variations begin to appear along each side of them continuously until eight of the Maseika is standing around their opponent in a perfect circle. Then each close in to attack, the Maseika makes each variation solid as their blow lands, a devastating series of blows is the outcome if the opponent doesn't manage to escape. This technique may only be used twice per thread. Any variations beyond the normal limit will fade after this technique. Opponent's Permission Required.	28	26	21	16	20	0	0	0	0
877	7	7	Glimpse of Eternity 	Hitome Mannen	What is considered beyond the beyond, a final level of mastery for those who dedicate themselves fully to the physical and mental. The user's body is at a limit here, attacks are powerful and rigid like a hammer's blow. Yet when they perform the ubuge dance, no one is more graceful.But regardless of their physical prowess, the style is now a fully mental game. There are few to teach one this level of mastery and any development at this point is all performed through mediation. Reviewing and unlocking those last few holes in eternity will make their defense flawless so they dig into their memory and review every second of every fight.	4	3			Stat Requirements: 26 Willpower, 25 Intelligence, 24 Tactics	33	33	31	19	25	0	0	0	0
876	1	1	Echoes of Silence	None	This stage in training is all about preparation, and learning and understanding the basics. Training the use of the Midnight Hymn has great importance at this stage, as do speed and stamina control exercises.Senses: While none of the users senses are noticeably beyond the human norm, the information received are interpreted at a higher degree than normally.Directed Strikes: "Striking your opponent's vulnerable points" is little more than a sentence to users at this stage. While they might be able to conceive of kicking their opponent in the shin, they are not likely to do much more than that.	3	4	2		Midnight Hymn IRequirements: Tactics 2, Willpower 2The Midnight Hymn is quite limited at this stage, and is more a supplement to the user's other senses rather than a direct replacement. Its range is only 50ft in a very narrow 90 degree field of vision and the user has a bit of trouble tracking moving objects, or anything smaller than a beach ball.	0	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0
876	2	2	Echoes of Silence	None	At this stage, the user begins the real training. They are taught how to accurately counter-attack an incoming enemy, and how to deal with the blow should they fail. Because the Midnight Hymn is still developing, grappling takes precedence here as the preferred form of combat. This keeps the enemy close and allows the user to know his location at all times. A small number of grasping techniques or simple trips are taught to facilitate this.Senses: While the user has gotten over the basic stage of adjustment, their senses still are not much sharper than those of a normal person. However, the user becomes proficient in Human Echolocation as a way of getting by in everyday life without their vision or the chakra draining Midnight Hymn.Directed Strikes: While still very basic, the directed strikes are improving. In combat, the user will go for kidneys, throats, stomachs and other areas where being struck is painful.	3	4	2		Midnight Hymn IIRequirements: Tactics 4, Willpower 4The user has progressed a bit further and he is able to make out slightly more detail, and does not have much trouble noticing moving objects. The smallest noticeable item is about the size of a kunai, and the range of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“visionÃ¢â‚¬ has increased to 75ft. For the first time, the user's Field of Vision (FOV) has increased ever so slightly to a 100 degree FOV.	0	8	6	0	0	6	0	0	0
876	3	3	Echoes of Silence	None	The differences between this and previous stage are minor. The user is taking the basics he learned and has begun applying them into a refined fighting style. Grappling manoeuvres are more efficient and the user is slowly learning effective ways to keep his opponent pinned or at the very least unable to move for a vital spot. Dodging is becoming more intuitive, thanks in part to the quickly improving Midnight Hymn and the sharpening of other senses.Senses: Thanks to training, the user's senses are becoming more refined. Simultaneously, their reaction speed to attacks that they can hear or feel has improved. Taste also gets a slight boost, and it is not uncommon for Echoes students to become notoriously picky eaters.Directed Strikes: The idea is still the same; go for obvious weak points. The technique is more refined, however, and the student learns exactly where to strike in order to cause more pain. Many users favour striking the throat or solar plexus, as this will often stun the opponent long enough to land another strike.	3	4	2		Midnight Hymn IIIRequirements: Tactics 7, Willpower 7, Intelligence 6The user can clearly make out the differences between different materials at this point, such as wood and metal, by the slightly different echoes they give off. Texture is still impossible to detect however, but the user can now detect small objects like shuriken accurately and their range has increased to 150ft in a 140 degree FOV.	0	12	8	0	0	8	0	0	0
876	4	4	Echoes of Silence	None	Counter-attacking is becoming much more instinctive now, and while the Hymn can compensate for sight, the user still prefers to Ã¢â‚¬Å“feelÃ¢â‚¬ where his enemy is in a good old fashioned wrestle to the death. However, finally the user feels comfortable fighting without the grapple element and thus has a much easier time of engaging multiple opponents.Senses: The user's senses are notably better than his vision-sporting peers. He has gotten used to his lack of sight and his other senses are really starting to compensate for it. Because of the need to concentrate in order to even move around, he is usually more perceptive to traps and obstacles than other people.Directed Strikes: A basic knowledge of pressure points is gained at this stage. If he is lucky, the user can strike points in the neck and chest to get much the same effect as a regular strike with minimal use of force. This is mostly effective when fighting opponents who take little damage from regular blows.	3	4	2		Midnight Hymn IVRequirements: Tactics 10, Willpower 10, Intelligence 8At this stage the Midnight Hymn has reached full potency and now it truly acts as a replacement for sight. The user can accurately perceive everything in a 180 degree FOV out to a combat range of 250ft. The smallest object he can detect is a pin and detail discrimination is very fine indeed Ã¢â‚¬' to the point of being able to read the ink on a page (though not as well as with eyes).	13	15	15	0	0	14	0	0	0
876	5	5	Echoes of Silence	None	At this level, the counter-attacks delivered are quick and fairly dangerous, as the user learns where to strike in order to bring his opponent down. Grapples are used less, though the user recognizes the superiority of such a tactic if the enemy is alone or slightly faster than the user.Senses: At this stage the Echoes disciples have faster reactions and greatly better hearing than any of their sighted equals. When it comes to noticing sounds, textures, tastes and smells, Echoes students are unmatched. Some are even able to properly execute ranged attacks based solely on listening to an opponent thanks to a much refined Human Echolocation skill.Directed Strikes: A more advanced knowledge of pressure points is gained. The user is able to strike an opponent in the chest or neck to trouble their breathing for one post, or strike a limb to make it go numb for one post.	3	4	2		Midnight Hymn VRequirements: Tactics 15, Willpower 15, Intelligence 13Because the Hymn itself has finally compensated for sight, the user can turn his training to other endeavours. At this stage, the Midnight Hymn branches off into something called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight ConcertoÃ¢â‚¬. While only rudimentary at this stage, the Concerto allows the user to feel vibrations through his feet and Ã¢â‚¬' to a small degree Ã¢â‚¬' through the air thanks to his much heightened senses.The range of the concerto is only around 5ft at this stage, but it offers the user a much improved ability to react to attacks because not only are the enemy's movements telegraphed by the way they move their bodies, but also because the air pressure being forced upon the user's skin from an attack at the precise location of impact allows them to brace or effect a last second dodge.	16	20	20	0	0	16	0	0	0
876	6	6	Echoes of Silence	None	At this level, the user poses a considerable danger. Counter-attacks are carried out with frightening precision and speed Ã¢â‚¬' many times leading to death for an unwary opponent. In many ways, this skill becomes demoralizing to the enemy as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“blind manÃ¢â‚¬ counters their every move.Senses: This level of sensing is indeed quite extraordinary. The user is able to handle fights without using the Hymn if the opponent is sufficiently inferior (Genin vs Jounin), and if there are no loud, distracting sounds near, such as explosions or a waterfall.Because of their abilities, users at this stage are often used as spies, since their operative range in the field of listening is far greater than that of most other shinobi, and at this stage even smell has taken on a role of its own; some users gaining the ability to track individuals by scent. The user does not need to actively concentrate to move around unless the area is difficult to move around in (thick jungle, land filled with jagged rocks and so on).Directed Strikes: The user is perfecting their knowledge of pressure points. They can strike an opponent's chest or throat to trouble their breathing for two posts, strike one of their limbs to paralyse it for one post, then have it go numb for an additional post, or strike the back of their neck to cause their opponent movement problems for one post. If the opponent's stamina is two levels less than the user's strength, they are paralysed for one post if they are struck in the neck.	3	4	2		Midnight Concerto IRequirements: Tactics 19, Willpower 19, Intelligence 18The Concerto improves in range and slightly improves in accuracy as well. It can be used out to a range of 10ft and gives the user a distinct advantage on the battlefield.	25	25	25	16	0	20	0	0	0
876	7	7	Echoes of Silence	None	At this point, the student has achieved complete mastery of the style. His speed alone is dangerous, but his counter-attacks are downright deadly and more than capable of stringing less opponents around with one hand by using carefully constructed grapples that target the pressure points of the enemy.Senses: The user's senses are so refined that the necessity of the Midnight Hymn is doubted by outsiders. The user is able to distinguish between different sounds with ease and a Jounin master has no trouble dueling a Genin even if there were explosions all around them.He has easier time recognising a lie according to the pitch of the speaker's voice. He will notice and identify smells that he knows from distances of five to several hundred meters away, depending on the strength of the smell (subtle perfume or smoke from a fire.) If the user knows a small or medium sized area well (such as his own room), he will notice if someone enters it, even without sound. He reacts to poison in his food seemingly before he puts it in his mouth.Their sensing abilities are so impressive that they are rumoured to be able to locate an opponent by their heartbeat alone. This is not quite true, but those who use the Echoes style like the psychological advantage it gives them, and will try to enforce it if possible.Directed Strikes: The user is highly skilled in using pressure points to their advantage. They can strike an opponent's chest or throat to give them trouble breathing for three posts, strike one of their limbs to paralyse it for one post, then have it go numb for two additional posts, or strike their neck to cause them trouble moving for two posts. Opponents with less than 15 stamina are paralysed for one post if struck in the neck, then have trouble moving for one post.	3	4	2		Midnight Concerto IIRequirements: Tactics 26, Willpower 25, Intelligence 24The Concerto reaches the peak of effectiveness at a range of 20ft, and the user's skill with it allows him to perceive an attack a milliseconds before it would actually become visible to a sighted ninja. Such a microscopic advantage is put to great use, as the user's superior speed allows him to strike quickly to potentially nullify a threat before it even occurs.	25	37	37	20	0	24	0	0	0
875	1	1	Great Pulse Fist 	Daidoumyaku	Palm Strikes - At this level the user is just learning the proper motions of the style and has yet to study the methods used to create vibrations in a targets body. Palm strikes, while certainly painful cause only normal external injury.Kicks - Kicks at this level are slow and awkward, and thus they connect poorly and do minimal damage. Most users of this style have problems effectively using kicks in combat and tend to avoid doing so. If a kick does connect, it is painful but not focused enough to do real damage.Defense - Defense is poor at this stage, as the user has not yet learned to properly anticipate attacks. Blocks, dodges, and other defensive gestures are effective if the attack is slow enough for the user to respond. Attempting to deflect thrown objects at this level will almost always result in failure.	3	3	3		Daidoumyaku - Mimi Senshi (Ear Stab)Requirements: Intelligence 2, Tactics 2Description: Serving as a direct attack to the ear, the user makes an attack, aiming at his adversary's face. If and only if the user is able to reach, with his or her palm, to a distance of mere inches (less than 3) from an opponent's head, they then use chakra to send a sound wave directly into the ear. The blow creates harmful vibrations to said opponent's ear drum, disabling them from hearing low volume sounds, such as a swooshing of a fist or a well aimed kunai, whispers or footsteps taken from a distance greater than 50 feet. This attack lasts 2 posts.	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
875	2	2	Great Pulse Fist 	Daidoumyaku	Palm Strikes - The user has now begun to learn the basics of what makes this style truly dangerous. The user is now able to transfer the energy in to a target to create minor painful vibrations. The damage is not significant from an individual attack but multiple attacks and the pain associated with them will begin to wear at a target. The primary difference between this level and the previous level is that attacks are slightly more focused and obviously more painful.Kicks - The kicks at this stage have become more fluid as the user has learned to perform them more gracefully. Kicks are now effective combat moves that can now be used properly in a fight, resulting in a painful and damaging addition to the user's arsenal.Defense - At this stage the user has begun to learn to anticipate and deal with attacks provided they do not come in rapid succession. Blocks, dodges, and other defensive gestures are now more effective and allow the user the opportunity to counter attack if one is possible. A user has a reasonable chance of deflecting a single thrown weapon.	3	3	3		Hakike no Tsuki (Nausea Thrust)Requirements: Intelligence 4, Tactics 4This technique uses the very basis of the style, the vibrating of the palm, as the principle for this elementary but potentially devastating attack. By first striking an open handed attack to the stomach of the foe, the user then vibrates his palm. These vibrations adversely affect the digestive system of the target, therefore causing severe nausea and all the associated ramifications. The sickness caused by this technique lasts for three posts.	6	8	0	6	0	0	0	0	0
875	3	3	Great Pulse Fist 	Daidoumyaku	Palm Strikes - Power has become an important factor now. The palm strike can now crack the bark of trees and leave a real sense of pain. If a target is struck by a direct attack they will feel severe pain in the immediate area and repeated attacks to the same area will cause minor hemorrhaging of tissues resulting in severe bruising and pain that will last several days unless treated.Kicks - At this stage the user has mastered the proper motion of the kick and all that remains is finding the proper balance and power. The kicks snapping motion creates a quick wind gust sufficient enough to extinguish a candle at three feet. Aside from the kick being able to inflict the normal physical damage when it connects, the 'air' created by the kick now actually lashes against the target like a whip, creating a stinging sensation.Defense - The user has learned not only to block and dodge attacks but to sometimes use blocks or dodges to set themselves in proper position for an attack. The user is now able to block or dodge single thrown projectiles and can sometimes even accomplish this feat against faster moving projectiles such as arrows.	3	3	3		Daidoumyaku - Saidan Assaiki (Altar Crusher)Requirements: Intelligence 7, Tactics 7, Willpower 6Description: This Taijutsu attack can be aimed at any of an opponent's appendages. By using the harmful vibrations cause by the palm strikes, the user hits either a hand or a leg, causing them, in time, to fall into numbness. Direct contact must be obtained in order for this attack to succeed. Once struck, an opponent has 3 posts' worth of waiting before the numbness takes effect, and the numbness itself takes 4 posts to wear off.	8	12	0	8	0	0	0	0	0
875	4	4	Great Pulse Fist 	Daidoumyaku	Palm Strikes - The Daidoumyaku style takes its true form at this level. Palm strikes here are a true show of power and skill. Even blocking the attacks now is painful unless done properly. Palm strikes have the power here to put out a candle from 3 yards away. When a target is struck vibrations go through their body from the point of contact and out slightly in a cone, with the main damage being at the center of the cone while damage along the outside of the cone is less severe. These attacks now literally rattle bones causing extreme pain and hit nerves, causing both pain and numbness.Kicks - The power of the kick has made a small jump, able to blow away candles from 5 feet away. The increased control allows for a greater snapping sound when the kick is performed. The snap of the air is now pronounced enough to lash at a target even if the kick does not connect directly and is more severe if the kick does connect directly.Defense - The user is now highly proficient in the art at blocking or dodging then counter attacking. Single thrown weapons are now completely useless against the user of this style unless the attacker can catch them by surprise. This is the first level where a user is able to turn aside more than one ranged attack at once but the effectiveness of this ability drops significantly as the number of attacks increase.	3	3	3		Daidoumyaku - Ibukuro Gusarito (Stomach Thrust)Requirements: Intelligence 10, Tactics 10, Willpower 8Description: This powerful palm strike is different then the standard ones taught by the style. The fingers are clenched into the hand to help concentrate the force and the extension of the arm is much longer then normal. The attack is aimed at the sternum, right about where the fifth ribs are. The force goes straight through the bone and reaches the lungs causing the victim to go into spastic coughing. The pain usually keeps other ninja down for a short while (1 post) while they get back their air and bearings.	14	18	11	14	0	0	0	0	0
875	5	5	Great Pulse Fist 	Daidoumyaku	Palm Strikes - Having now begun to reach the early stages of mastery, the palm strikes at this level are dangerous indeed. A targets bone will literally rattle inside them, causing severe pain and possibly lead to minute fractures of the bone along with tears to the surrounding tissues. The nerves in the area are also rattled which has the effect of dulling the severe pain after a few moments but at the same time it also renders the area temporarily useless.Kicks - The motion of the kick is quick, almost impossible to perceive with the naked eye and the resulting impact is like being snapped with an enormous whip. The air lash created by this attack is sufficient to tear cloth and will cause lacerations to skin, this is in addition to the physical damage that results from the kick itself.Defense - At this stage even a defensive move can be used as offense. By using their hands to turn attacks aside the user is now actually able to focus their energy while defending, resulting in a block becoming a small attack. Individual blocks do not cause significant damage but an attacker will soon feel their arms growing sore and numb after prolonged combat. The user is also now able to turn aside several ranged weapon attacks in rapid succession.	3	3	3		Daidoumyaku - Juushin Tomosen (Brutal Heart Stopper)Requirements: Intelligence 15, Tactics 15, Willpower 13Description: This dangerous jutsu is dangerous to say the least. Striking the opponent where the heart would be, the force goes inside and causes a sudden jump in the heart stopping it for just one second where it all of a sudden kicks back. The sudden pain of death stuns opponents and leaves one all of a sudden short of breath and exhausted.	18	23	15	16	0	0	0	0	0
875	6	6	Great Pulse Fist 	Daidoumyaku	Palm Strikes - A direct hit at this stage will almost always result in a broken or fractured bone where as a glancing blow will result in severe tissue damage and bruises. Having almost reached the pinnacle of perfection in their art, users at this level are dangerous and deadly opponents that few wish to contend with.Kicks - Striking with almost unperceivable speed and landing like the sting of a thousand whips, the kicks at this level are sufficient to cause severe injury to any portion of the body they strike. In addition to the damage from the kick the airwave created by this kick will cause severe lacerations and air burns to skin.Defense - At this stage the defenses of the target grow to a stage of startling skill. The user is capable of using their superior speed to block long flurries of attacks, as well as using their own chakra to deflect stronger, more concentrated blows. Furthermore, at this stage the user is quite proficient at channeling his own energy into a kind of defensive weapon, therefore allowing them to hasten the pace of the numbing of the foe's striking limbs. Finally, the user is able to deflect an even greater number of projectiles, making all but the largest and most accurate of volleys to deviate from their course.	3	3	3		Daidoumyaku - Parusuha Saiganki (Pulse Rock Crusher)Requirements: Intelligence 19, Tactics 19, Willpower 18Description: Taking a different path this time, this technique is not aimed at an enemy's body, but at a battle's surroundings. Using the awesome powers of sound waves and vibrations, the user strikes downwards onto the ground with their palms. By channeling said vibrations and using the earth as a natural conductor, the user aims them to the ground under their opponent. Swiftly and without pause, the vibrations cause the earth to shudder and break, turning into nothing more than dirt and sand. Unawares, an opponent may fall down to this newly created small chasm, or at least lose their balance for a few precious seconds.	25	30	20	21	0	15	0	0	0
875	7	7	Great Pulse Fist 	Daidoumyaku	Palm Strikes - At this level, the user of this style achieves a frightening level of power. Here, a direct blow from an attack will not only result in broken bones, but brutal, crushing blows. Often is the time when the limb of a shinobi struck by one of these blows is rendered limp and useless; a victim of compound fractures as well as chipped fragments of bone caused by the vibrations of the user's palm. Furthermore, the tissue damage caused at this stage is intensive, as the blows now strikes harder and deeper than ever before, rending and bruising muscle tissue with an almost unspeakable ferocity, a fact that further adds to the sheer devastation of each landed strike.Kicks- The kicks of a user at this level are now at their peak, capable of inflicting severe damage to any part of the target's body at unprecedented speeds. Furthermore, the airwaves created by the kick now create messy gashes, painful bleeding wounds, and devastating burns to the flesh of the target. The wounds caused by this tend to cause excruciating pain to the victim, and thus tend to hamper the combat ability of the afflicted greatly.Defense- The user has learned to block attacks purely by instinct and react to them almost before they are launched. Unless an attacker is careful, the results of their attack could leave them worse off than their opponent as the user can now inflict severe injury just by blocking. Without the aid of some type of jutsu technique, throwing weapons are virtually useless against the user now and can be turned aside in almost unlimited numbers.	3	3	3		Daidoumyaku - Manako Oshi (Eye Push)Requirements: Intelligence 26, Tactics 25, Willpower 24Description: Only truly despicable and horrendous people use this technique against their enemies. This technique first requires that the user place his hand over the eye of an enemy. He then uses a palm strike to thrust it forward. However, the reciprocal force will break the user's wrist and fingers. The forward force actually pushes the victim's eyeball into his head, tearing the muscles that hold it in place. The pain caused by this usually renders the victim unconscious. However, far more debilitating is the second effect. The impulse that forces the eye back also damages it considerably, blinding the victim in that eye until he is treated by a jounin-level medical nin.	34	37	28	26	0	18	0	0	0
874	1	1	The Pact	Seijuu Techniques	When a Seijuu is first adapting to their pact, they cannot take the demon into them--at least not yet. Lacking familiarity and control, inviting a demon into their soul at this point is a sure way to lose said soul. A few young Seijuu have been lost this way, attempting to gain some extra strength, but instead letting their bodies be consumed before they ever gain anything. This means the Seijuu keeps themselves distant from the creature they formed a pact with, avoiding letting it tap into their being anymore than necessary.Even though this isn't a standard fighting style, Seijuu learning from other Seijuu tend to emphasize aspects of dirty fighting and other unsavory, brutal tactics. Focusing more so on countering and bully fighting prepares the body for the demonic stresses of The Pact much more so than organized katas or training.	3				PhaseThe Seijuu's limb becomes translucent. For a moment, it can be forced to pass through physical objects. This takes concentration to maintain, and ends just as quickly. Usually this is used to escape bonds, or bypass obstructions. Any attempt to make their limb solid while it is inside of something ends in tragedy for the Seijuu, and the object being unfazed. This is the Seijuu testing the connection between themselves and Donshoku's realm.Black ArmAn arm of black mist forms over the Seijuu's arm, allowing them to stretch it 5 feet further than their own arm and still use it for taijutsu. The arm last for as many posts as the user wants. No handseals are permitted while this technique is used.Base Effect: 5 feetStage Two: 10 feetStage Three: 15 feet, and Handseals are possible.	0	0	0	3	5	0	0	0	0
874	2	2	The Pact	Seijuu Techniques	After time training with other Seijuu behind closed doors, the secret of the shades is unlocked. Included is the first taste of becoming one with the demon. By opening small portals to Donshoku's plane, the hungry creatures from beyond can find their way through. Unfortunately, at this stage, most Seijuu aren't powerful enough to force them back to their own dimension. This makes the Seijuu vulnerable.In terms of style, this is a stage that focuses primarily on defense--if it could be called that. The Seijuu invoke imagery of wounded tigers, desperate, scrappy low blows and feints of weakness followed by sharp and sudden acts of aggression. All for the goal and purpose of making the opponent as vulnerable as the Seijuu themselves.Full Pact:By forming a full pact, a Seijuu lets the shade loose inside of them, biting off a sliver of their own soul to feed the beast. At this point it doesn't do anything more than give a small boost of physical power--an increase in one level in the physical specialty of their own personal demon. The pact be maintained for 2 posts, and then the bonus is reversed for the remainder of the thread.	3				Kuchiyose: Dark ReachA simple bite of the finger, and a Seijuu can touch any flat surface to open a small hole to Yomi. While this hole isn't large enough for anything intelligent to come through, there are primitive and hungry creatures that live there. Tendrils, arms, black as midnight and covered in odd marks, come reaching through to grab whatever is close. Five of these can reach through at a time, but they have a mind of their own, and attempt to reach anything within five feet. They can be easily destroyed with sharp weapons, but they stick around for five posts. They don't have the strength to do much more than slow someone down. They also cannot distinguish between targets, and will attack allies, or their summoner.Soul SlashRequirements: Full Pact ActivatedThe Seijuu's hands glow with black chakra energy, and then they attack with an open hand. If the attack lands, it will rip at the chakra coils of the target on top of whatever physical damage is accomplished. This removes one usage from every stage of the target, up to the stage that the Seijuu has in this list. (For example, if the Seijuu has stage 3 in this list, a target will lose one usage from stage 1, 2, and 3.)	6	0	0	5	9	0	0	0	0
874	3	3	The Pact	Seijuu Techniques	Anger is the right word to describe a Seijuu at this stage. Usually a chuunin, they have realized what their clan's true power is, and received a glimpse of how they have come this far. It also describes the demon, chained to this world, starved of the power it wants, and ready to do anything to claim more. Seijuu become prepared to risk anything for a chance to destroy those in their way, including harming themselves. While their capability with using the power of their chained demon hasn't increased, you'll find most Seijuu more willing to try it at this point.Anger must be directed, no matter the circumstance. Within the fighting style of the Seijuu a special emphasis is placed upon resourcefulness--the ability to make use of improvisational weaponry. As always, the goal remains to invoke as much damage and create as many openings as quickly as possible--in this sense a wild, brawling style is the preferred method. Relentless effort and wrath preferred to strategy and caution.	3				Negative ChargeNegative charge extends the chakra of the demon over a weapon or projectile, making it appear covered in a strange darkness that is hard to focus on. When struck by a negative charge weapon, it looks like the chakra strikes out in a violent flash. Regardless of how hard the blow was, the dark chakra creates odd patterns of burns and cuts that reach deep beneath the skin. While it never hurts internal organs, it can make physical armor and shields pointless as the chakra reaches through them to attack.RavenousRequirements: Full Pact ActivatedWith chakra flowing from their limbs, the Seijuu attacks with frenzied blows. The attacks, even if unarmed or with a blunt weapon, use the energy from the chakra to slice and cut. Usually this leaves nasty wounds, cuts into armor, or even slices through defensive jutsu Stage Two and below.	8	0	0	9	11	0	0	0	0
874	4	4	The Pact	Seijuu Techniques	As a Seijuu reaches for more power, they will realize what every Seijuu has come to terms with before them. There is no way to gain power but to make sacrifices. You must give up your sense of purity to gain the strength needed to gain a foothold in the clan, your village, and the world. A chuunin Seijuu at this level will give their demon access to even more of their own chakra, and in return the demon gives them access to infernal power.Comfort with the demon's strength and the nature of relying on it's power has affected the way the Seijuu operates. They are more focused on evasive maneuvers, counters, feints and other sorts of deceptions. A hallmark of Seijuu tactics is the ability to mix up both the range and location of strikes, constantly dashing in and out of reach while also aiming both high and low. More often than not a direct, brutal and powerful punch is the preferred method of handling mostly any obstacle.*Full Pact IIThe Full Pact now works for 3 posts, but after that the Seijuu is weakened for the rest of the thread. They also lose jutsu usages from ninjutsu and genjutsu each post as if they are using their highest available stage of nin/genjutsu. Their chakra has been sapped away by the demon, and will take time, or a soldier pill, to recover. The bonus from The Full Pact is also increased, now increasing the physical level of the demon's specialty by 2 levels and then is lowered by the same for the rest of the thread. No physical level may go below level 1.	3				Kuchiyose: Chakra HunterWith blood drawn, the Seijuu can create a small portal to Yomi anywhere, even mid-air. 5 Small black orbs fly out, a red eyeball on each. These shades fly toward the designated target, projectiles with a mind of their own. If they impact with their target, they stick like sludge, feeding on miniscule amounts of chakra. The Seijuu can sense these demons out to 150 feet, as long as they are feeding on something. Every turn, the demons will sap enough chakra to steal a stage 1 usage from from those they are feeding on. The demons can be attacked, and die to even simple attacks. Eventually, sometimes after a day, sometimes after a week, the demons will simply fade away due to being away from their home realm.FeedingRequirement: Full Pact ActivatedThe arm of the Seijuu becomes covered in their demon's chakra before they make a taijutsu attack. If the attack lands, the black chakra will attach to the target, and begin to directly feed on the target's chakra. This feed line sticks around, breaking only when the target breaks it with an attack with a sharp weapon, or by pulling far enough away (around 20 feet). On the turn of this attack, and every turn after that, the feeding continues. The Seijuu's personal demon will absorb chakra from the target. This will remove a usage from the target from a stage equal to the Seijuu's highest stage in this style. For every usage removed, The Full Pact can be used for another post. (For example, if the Seijuu has stage 5 in this style, the target will lose a stage 5 usage in Ninjutsu/Genjutsu every turn, and the Full Pact will gain another post of duration)	14	0	0	14	18	14	0	0	0
874	5	5	The Pact	Seijuu Techniques	Many Jounin Seijuu have turned their feelings inwards. Not necessarily hate, but an awareness that life as the lords of Sound comes with many pitfalls and dangers. Many Seijuu are willing to learn darker and more dangerous arts when they reach Jounin rank, becoming reckless even for men and women who have a demon latched onto their soul. The Full Pact is as strong as it was before, but an increased awareness of the contract makes it's use second nature.An increased awareness changes the philosophy of hand to hand combat as well, supplementing their already developed natural ability is an increased proficiency at fighting against large groups. It all centers around awareness and assessment, knowledge of spatial relations and where to hit to disable or stun. There is no such thing as a fair fight and the Seijuu is beginning to be able to turn the tides--even when his own fights aren't particularly fair.	3				Kuchiyose: Greater ShadeA greater shade is a shade demon on the same level as the one attached to a Seijuu for a pact. Brought into our world without someone to control it, the creature looks like a too-thin silhouette of swarming dark chakra. Red eyes pierce the otherwise indistinct form. It is solid though, and will attack the most vulnerable human-like target it can find that isn't a Seijuu. Their hands end in sharpened claw-like hands, and they can stretch them as if they had the stage three Black Arm. Their attacks also drain chakra like Soul Slash (as if the Great Shade knew stage 3 of this list). The lilting shriek they make when fighting has been called unnerving. They can be destroyed with enough force, and are especially vulnerable to ninjutsu, since it rips through their chakra-based form. They are completely immune to genjutsu though. They are level 4 on each taijutsu scale.	16	0	0	18	20	18	0	0	0
874	6	6	The Pact	Seijuu Techniques	In the end, the strongest Seijuu are those who can come to terms with the deal their clan has made. Donshoku destroys the weak, the Shades devour wimps, so the lords of Sound must be strong enough to overcome all. This acceptance of terms creates a dangerous shinobi who is willing to be eaten from within in order to destroy the enemies of Hidden Sound and the Seijuu.The actual combat of the Seijuu has reached it's pinnacle--their style is tenacious and their defense, an explosive offense, is impregnable. A Seijuu unleashing their power at the fullest at this stage is a vicious, ruthless, merciless killing machine--hitting nerve endings, funny bones, eyes, and other sensitive areas with brutal accuracy and efficiency. Brawling at it's utmost sophistication.	3				EtherRequirement: Full Pact ActivatedEther is a unique technique in that it makes use of the Full Pact in extremely unique way. By using the Seijuu as a conduit for dark chakra, the demon within is able to project an aura of corruption within six meters. This aura of corruption effects anyone within that zone by inflicting upon them the same mental, physical and spiritual drain given to the Seijuu. The stronger the body, the stronger the effect of the aura and the corresponding personal drain. All within the six meters, ally or enemy alike, experience a brief reversal of their Taijutsu bonuses (+10 to Speed would become -10 to speed) for two posts. During this state the Seijuu gains no Full Pact bonuses as well as being rendered immobile and in a trance like state, after those two posts the Seijuu experiences all effects as if they had just initiated and closed the Full Pact. No opponents physical stats can go below 1 due to this jutsu.	20	0	16	23	29	23	0	0	0
874	7	7	The Pact	Seijuu Techniques	There is something stronger. Some Seijuu say this requires the power to take Donshoku itself into you, while others say that the Seijuu and their demon will gain mutual power that puts them on par with the ancient deal-maker. Regardless, this level of power should be feared, for the Seijuu who is this powerful is also risking their life with their every breath. The demon within them could, it would seem, swallow them whole whenever it pleases.Full Pact III:The Full Pact is stronger than ever. Over 4 posts of power, the personal demon of the Seijuu can warp their strength and create a raw and savage might. Every post of power counts as using a jutsu in the lowest stage of their ninjutsu and genjutsu. After the 4 posts, the Seijuu will be weakened by the amount that they were gaining. The lowest level this will take the Seijuu is 1. This technique raises the Seijuu's designated specialty by 3 levels for the duration and then lowers it by 3 levels after the duration--will never go below level 1.	3					24	0	20	32	35	32	0	0	0
873	1	1	Transient Entanglement 	Karisome Mosture	Perception: Hardly different from normal. The user is only able to focus his attention upon one person and a vague idea of the surroundings.Control: 10 threads can be controlled. Being too inexperienced to chase after multiple targets, the user can only direct the threads as a single batch towards a single target within a radius of 4 meters. As of yet the threads may only take a linear path. It is impossible for the user's current level to concentrate all the threads to anchor on a certain point; the best he can do is anchor the threads within a general area, such as along the forearm or a across the chest and ribcage.Resistance: As strong as normal threads in clothing. One can tug apart with bare fingers and take only an instant to sever them with a blade.Constriction: Loose, uneven and easily unraveled with a simple tug, the most damage at this level is red markings on the skin.Pull: It'll be easier to use one's hands to tug something as that is the strength at this Stage. The most one can achieve is pluck a kunai from the ground or snap a twig off a branch. The target can easily resist the strength of the pull or even overwhelm it by reeling in the opposite direction.Toss: ---Conversion: Providing the user has knowledge of at least Stage 1 of the clan ninjutsu, he can now convert one thread used in this style for a clan ninjutsu technique.	d	4	5			3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
873	2	2	Transient Entanglement 	Karisome Mosture	Perception: Better than before, though not by much. While the user must still focus his primary attention those before him, he has now begun to take a small note of those within his peripheral vision. Grasp of surrounding has evolved to a decent judgment in distance and timing between the user and a certain landmark.Control: A total 15 threads can be controlled. User has enough experience now to pursue a single target within 7 meter radius without difficulty. Flight path may now swing within a perimeter of 17 centimeters. Anchoring is now more refined with all the threads located within a perimeter of few inches. User may choose to divert his attention to two separate batches by decreasing power to that of Stage One.Resistance: Slightly stronger than cotton threads. Pulling them apart with bare hands will result in painful welts across the skin, though still just as easily cut with any bladed object.Constriction: Enough pressure is exerted onto a limb that the threads can act as a tourniquet. Now the target experiences pain as the threads dig into the skin and pressure the muscle beneath.Pull: Strong enough to jerk an unwary person off their balance and cause a slight jolt to the joint connecting the covered body part and the rest of the body.Toss: ---Conversion: Providing the user has knowledge of at least Stage 1 of the clan ninjutsu, he is now able to covert a maximum of two used in this style for clan ninjutsu techniques.	d	4	5	Name: StaggerDescription: The user directs a batch towards the opponent's legs, usually around the ankles or calves. By using constriction, the user tightens the threads and effectively bind the target's feet together before pulling on the threads with the hope of jerking the opponent off their feet.	Name: BandageRequirements: 4 Control, 4 ReserveDescription: The technique where the user restricts the movement of a target's limb by weaving a layer of skin-tight linen against the skin. Akin to the limb wrapped by tight folds of bandaging, it makes simple tasks such as molding handseals, grabbing weapons or other actions which require movement of joints a tiring task. Only a hand or a foot may be covered and the target may easily pull the bandaging apart. At Stage 3 the target may choose to direct the attack at a weapon instead with the intention of "sheathing" a bladed edge.	6	8	0	0	0	0	0	6	0
873	3	3	Transient Entanglement 	Karisome Mosture	Perception: Various targets can now be followed without difficulty so long as they remain within normal and peripheral vision. The user now have an acute insight into the geographic of the area, one detailed enough for him to hypothesize the consequence of physical changes in surrounding will have on battle style. He is also beginning to grasp the timing of opponent's movements for more efficient attacks as well as assess the speed of an incoming attack.Control: A total of 20 threads can be controlled. User is able to extend control for 10 meters. Flight path may now swing within a perimeter of 30 centimeters. All the threads in a batch can now be anchored within a perimeter of couple of centimeters. Two batches can be directed towards two separate targets without problem.Resistance: Threads can no longer be torn by bare hands, unless the target has no problem with cutting their palm and fingers in the process. More force than a casual flick of a blade is required to cut the threads.Constriction: The force of tightening threads is now strong enough to crack bark and splinter the wood beneath. On human flesh the threads can now dig into the skin and draw blood.Pull: Saplings can now be uprooted with a single tug while moving targets can be turned from their original course. If used on a limb, cause a sharp pain on the joint between the body and limb by the sudden force of the tug.Toss: User can only flick small objects such as kunai, rocks and even a small stool into the air. At this level the user can not sustain the anchor on the item once it's been tossed up.Conversion: Providing the user has knowledge of at least Stage 1 of the clan ninjutsu, he can now convert three threads used in this style for a clan ninjutsu technique.	d	4	5	Name: LeashDescription: A useful technique in various situation, though mostly when one wishes to limit a target's area of movement. Instead of looping then anchoring a batch onto a target, the user anchors the threads onto the closest inanimate object near the target, usually a wall, tree, rock or just into the ground. This effectively shackles the target to the object, restraining their movement until they are freed of the threads.Name: Hidden TossDescription: By using the newly learned Toss ability, the user can pluck an object with the threads and fling it towards a target. Size and weight of the object depends on user's current proficiency in the style.	Name: NettingRequirements: 7 Control, 7 Reserve, 6 PowerDescription: A cast net is spun to be tossed and ensnare a single target. Once captured, the net shrinks to fit the target's body size. While it can be woven anywhere within the user's control radius, it is most effective when placed directly before the target's path of movement so they run head-first into the net.	8	12	0	0	0	0	0	8	0
873	4	4	Transient Entanglement 	Karisome Mosture	Perception: At this level the process of 'scanning' is introduced. Prior to this the user must maintain constant eyesight with the target(s) in order to assess their direction, speed and action. 'Scanning' allows the user to pick up the same information with a briefer glance. Compare this to speed-reading a page of a book; one's mind does not absorb every sentence printed on a page. As his eyes run down the page, the brain only focuses on a few important words such as nouns and verbs. From the select words he did notice the reader is then able to grasp the bare bones of what was said on the page. The practitioner may scan three moving targets positioned apart from each other to give himself a general knowledge of their actions. He is yet unable to hypothesize anything more than each target's general direction and speed. He may calculate the speed of several attacks and counter or dodge to for minimal damage when complete evasion is beyond his skill.Control: A total of 25 threads can be controlled. User is able to extend control for 15 meters. Flight path may now swing within a perimeter of 70 centimeters. At this level the user is able to use his threads to swat down incoming projectiles. All the threads in a batch can now be anchored within a perimeter of one centimeter. Adding to the ability to target two separate opponents, a third batch can be made to target an inanimate object with Stage Three power.Resistance: By now the threads are as durable as shinobi wires. As such one requires same amount of strength as a normal attack to cut the threads.Constriction: There is now enough force to squeeze a block of timber splinters and dent soft metal. The threads are now able to cut through skin and into the muscle.Pull: Strong enough to nullify the momentum of a target's movement by pulling in the opposite direction. Cause jarring pain to the joint ligaments as the limb is pulled from the body.Toss: One is now able to flick up heavy objects such as large weapons, tables, large branches, medium sized boulders. However, one can now retain anchor on the target through its flight long enough to direct its path. After directing, however, the anchors fall off.Conversion: Providing the user has knowledge of at least Stage 1 of the clan ninjutsu, he can now convert four threads used in this style for a clan ninjutsu technique.	d	4	5	Name: NooseDescription: The user directs a single batch at the target's neck. Once anchored, the user constricts and pulls the threads in an attempt to cut off the target's oxygen supply. At Stage Five, the threads can cut through skin and cartilage and into the windpipe.Name: DisarmDescription: A simple way of relieving an opponent of a means of harm. Anchoring a batch around the blade, hilt or body of a weapon, the user then uses a mixture of Pull and Toss to flick the weapon out of the opponent's hand and into the air.		14	18	11	0	0	0	0	14	0
873	5	5	Transient Entanglement 	Karisome Mosture	Perception: The user has begun to familiarize themselves with scanning with the ability to scan what can be seen with a turn of the head in either direction. Now they are able to estimate distance between a target and another object and gain greater insight into the opponent's speed. The user's note of his surrounding has also heightened by another notch with the inclusion of the topographic element of elevation contours. He has also begun to merge the geographic information with his target's movements to predict the optimal time for an attack. Defensively he is now able to time his evasion against simultaneous attacks so to be hit by the one with the least force.Control: A total of 30 threads can be controlled. User is able to extend control for 20 meters. Flight path may now swing within a perimeter of 1.5 meters. Anchor is accurate within perimeter of half a centimeter. Three batches can now be directed towards three moving targets.Resistance: While the threads themselves are not stronger, by converging the threads in each batch close together it increases a batch's resistance against attack. Now a professional cut by a bladed weapon is necessarily to cut the threads.Constriction: Able to crush wood and squeeze metal plates out of shape. On human flesh, it can now slice into fat and muscle with ease.Pull: Tree limbs may be torn off from the trunk with the force of the pull. If used on a body part, the action may result in dislocation of the joint between the body and limb.Toss: Humans may now be tossed up from the ground. The anchor may now remain upon the target until the target falls onto the ground or into another object.Conversion: Providing the user has knowledge of at least Stage 1 of the clan ninjutsu, he can now convert five threads used in this style for a clan ninjutsu technique.	d	4	5	Name: Straight-jacket.Description: The user constricts a batch of strings around the user's chest and arms, binding their hands to their side. He then utilize Toss to fling the captured target into something else, may it be a wall, boulder or even another person.	Name: Trawl NetRequirements: 15 Control, 15 Reserve, 13 PowerDescription: An upgrade of Netting technique used against opponents too fast for one to attack. Rather than weaving a net in the target's path, the user lays a spread of threads ten meter in radius around the user. Anyone inside or steps into the radius will find a wall of webbing rising around them to envelope and tie them to the spot.	17	24	15	0	0	0	0	16	0
873	6	6	Transient Entanglement 	Karisome Mosture	Perception: 360 degrees of information may be processed with a scan, though the user must constantly scan again to keep track of information. At this level he is able to, with the use of distance, speed, angle and reaction time, hypothesize the greatest chance of an attack successfully hitting a moving target. Defence and offense have now merged into one, with the user adding the time a target spends by attacking into the equation for optimal moment of attack.Control: A total of 35 threads can be controlled. User is able to extend control for 25 meters. Flight path may now swing within a perimeter of 2.5 meters. Anchor is precise. Adding to the previous Stage's Control is a forth batch that can act against immobile targets.Resistance: ---Constriction: The user has now reached the level to slice through metal armor cut into the body beneath. Only bones stand in the way of complete decapitation; if the user anchors a batch around a joint and constricts, the threads will cut through ligament to slice off the limb. While strong enough to cut into cement and stone it is unable to completely crush, only leave deep furrows.Pull: Cement foundations and deep-seated roots now mean nothing. The user is now capable of moving entire trees, levering up pavements and tarred roads, dislodge town statues from their mooring. The only thing short of possible is pulling up a house from its foundation, but we are getting there.Toss: Anchor may now remain on a target even after it falls to the ground, allowing the user to toss it again without re-dispatching a batch. This, however, only applies to inanimate objects; humans and chakra-infused items requires re-attaching after each Toss.Conversion: Providing the user has knowledge of at least Stage 1 of the clan ninjutsu, he can now convert six thread used in this style for a clan ninjutsu technique.	d	4	5	Name: DetachDescription: A technique which requires at least two batches. The user anchors to two different parts of a target's body before pulling the two batches in the opposite direction in an attempt to tear off a body part(s) with brute force.	Name: SewRequirements: 19 Control 19, 19 Reserve 19, 18 Power 18Description: The first technique which utilize the needles in the style. Just as its name implies, the user binds two objects by "sewing" them together. This can be done between any two things within half a meter of each other. Examples may be sewing the lips closed, an arm to the side of the torso or even a hand sewn to a tabletop. One may release themselves of this technique either by cutting the threads or pulling themselves loose at the cost of ripping out chunks of skin and flesh.	23	32	20	0	0	0	0	20	0
873	7	7	Transient Entanglement 	Karisome Mosture	Perception: Distance, timing, angle, speed; everything has infused seamlessly into a living three-dimensional map within the user's head. Calculating when one team-member is too far to aid his comrade when attacked, predicting the effects a sudden alteration of surrounding will have on a target's speed, the amount of milliseconds between a target's reaction time and impact against an attack; everything within the style's reach is now within his control. If a target's speed or direction is undesirable to the user he may slow or redirect them as he wish. Every action is one more step that lures an unwary prey into a deadly trap from which there is no escape.Control: A total of 35 threads can be controlled. User is able to extend control for 30 meters. Flight path may now swing within a perimeter of 4 meters. Anchoring precision remains unchanged. Now the user may use four batches to chase down four distinct targets.Resistance: ---Constriction: Now nothing is barred. With a jerk of the user's hand, the threads are now able to cut through armor, clothing and muscle. At this level even a brick and steel wrought walls are crushed to shrapnel, gravel and dust.Pull: By now all but the sturdiest and heaviest of man-made structures can not be jerked out of its position. Small housing, foundation pillars, even the odd part of a bridge now and again. For humans, only those steeped in defensive styles have a chance to remain inert against the pull.Toss: ---	d	4	5	Name: DissectDescription: Utilizing all three components in control of threads, the user constricts a batch through the muscle to rest against the bone. He then initiates a merge of Toss and Pull. As the target is flung to one side the threads are pulled in the opposite direction. This causes the threads to slice through the muscle. Performed correctly, it allows the user to shave all the flesh off a target's limb.		35	40	24	0	0	0	0	22	22
872	1	1	Komodo Razor Fist	None	Description: Only basic physical conditioning and the proper care and use of the user's claws are taught at this level. A few routine types can be used but any serious fight will probably devolve into desperate brawling - with the user on the loosing side due to their lack of strength.Claw Length: After only learning the basics of the style, the user has leant to extend or retract their claws as necessary.	a	4	5			0	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0
872	2	2	Komodo Razor Fist	None	Description: With the claws now more familiar to the user they can begin practicing to use it more efficiently. Swipes are the easiest method of dealing damage because of the low strength they require, and while such attacks rarely cause serious injury they can be very dangerous when aimed towards the face.Claw Length: Careful study and long hours of practice have allowed the user to effectively extend his claws an additional inch beyond the norm without sacrificing the weapon's integrity.	a	4	5			0	6	8	0	6	0	0	0	0
872	3	3	Komodo Razor Fist	None	Description: The user has expanded their strength enough to incorporate basic thrusts into their style, and while the claws themselves are small having five punctures in your chest can hurt all the same. This is the first stage where defence is stressed as combat becomes more prevalent. It's rough but relatively efficient - even if it's only used to let the user escape to regain the advantage.Claw Length: A further refinement of the user's abilities allow an extension of two inches to be effortlessly maintained.	a	4	5			0	8	12	0	8	0	0	0	0
872	4	4	Komodo Razor Fist	None	Description: From here on out it's vital that the user be capable of killing his enemy or disabling his ability to fight on the first strike. Surprise is of the essence so to speak. In addition to learning the critical areas of the human body so as to strike more effectively, the user also refines his attacking skills. The thrust is improved upon as the user gains enough strength to rend their opponents: after stabbing the enemy with their claws the user closes their fist and pulls away - hopefully tearing a chunk of the opponent's flesh with him.Claw Length: Again, nothing fancy happens here but the user does learn to extend their claws a total of 3 inches now.	a	4	5			11	14	18	0	14	0	0	0	0
872	5	5	Komodo Razor Fist	None	Description: Defence again improves as a means of allowing the user to escape so that he may strike again. Given a surprise attack, most users of this style are capable of ending the fight in a single, clean blow to a vital area of the human body. It's not uncommon for users to concentrate on the most effective means of disposal at this level either - with many practitioners seeking to sever the spine, pierce the brain or tear out a kidney for an instant, silent kill.Claw Length: If these talons can be called claws anymore then no land beast posses them this long. They can be extended a total of four inches past the base length - quite terrifying really.	a	4	5			16	20	20	0	16	0	0	0	0
872	6	6	Komodo Razor Fist	None	Description: There's nothing much more to say at this level. The user works upon refining his escape technique. Hit and run tactics can now be used after almost any attack.Claw Length: Five, razor sharp, inches can now be added onto the user's claws; each finger is like an edged knife just waiting to cut deep into the flesh of the enemy and shuffle him from the mortal coil.	a	4	5			20	25	30	18	18	0	0	0	0
872	7	7	Komodo Razor Fist	None	Description: There's nothing more to say at this level. While the user is incapable of matching an equal enemy in hand-to-hand combat on any level of skill, they are masters of striking first .Claw Length: With half a foot of additional claw on each finger, these masters look to have the hands of devilish monsters and many seek to perpetuate this image.	a	4	5			23	38	38	21	23	0	0	0	0
871	1	1	Under One Umbrella 	Aiaigasa	- Spear OffenceFor the neophyte, emphasis on attack is achieved firmly through rote memorization. They are taught to how to stand firm with their spears, how to move - albeit slowly - without compromising their braced stance. Attack with the razor edges of the Umbrella are not taught here and over all training focuses solely on the most basic of spear techniques: the thrust and the recovery.- Shield DefenceMuch like learning how to use the razor blades, the proper use of the shield is disregarded at such an early level of training. Students only learn how to compensate for its weight and disposition in a fight. In fact, most pupils choose not to fight with the shield open at this stage! Still though, for desperate circumstances, the user is taught how to effectively open his Umbrella should the need arise and the stance training can afford a stable enough posture for dampening a blow that hits the shield head on.- Flight ControlUnfortunately, such advanced techniques are simply the stuff of dreams at this point. Your sensei might have shown you what you might be able to achieve but you yourself can't even get a single Umbrella into the air at this point in time.- Needle ControlIf you can't even fly the Umbrella at this stage then you can't shoot needles from them. In fact,why are you even carrying a Yang Umbrella? Put it down and go back to practicing the spear patterns. Though with that said, you do get taught some of the basic theories to do with aim and simple senbon practice makes a nice change from the monotony of the thrust, recover, thrust recover pattern you're usually working on.	3	4	2	Braced for Impact: A simple technique taught to all beginning students, this move is more a stance rather than an actual attack that allows the neophyte to place all his strength into stopping something with his weapon. The end of the spear is placed on the ground, with the edge just against the inside of their rear foot. Hands are generally placed on the middle of the shaft and the user leans into the charging opponent. Should all go well they should be stopped upon your spear point.		4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
871	2	2	Under One Umbrella 	Aiaigasa	- Spear OffenceThe simple thrust is a comfortable and familiar technique to the budding apprentice by this stage, and the user is adept at placing himself in a position where he can use his most refined technique. Most of the focus at this stage goes into familiarizing the user with the ins and outs of their special weapon: students are taught how to use the butt of their spear to deal with an enemy from behind and the first techniques dealing with the razor edges are gradually introduced into the training syllabus.- Shield DefenceLikewise, learning the intricacies of one's weapon includes learning how to use the shield to some small degree. Training here is mostly concerned with teaching the student how to fight effectively with the shield open - something which naturally provides a deal of cover for the user - and beyond that the user also learns how to stop attacks with the shaft of his spear should a situation become too close for comfort.- Flight ControlThere has still been no progress in this aspect whatsoever - though the rigorous training regime has started to hint at possible lessons in the future as certain lessons have focused entirely on decorative kata with exceptionally light and fragile Umbrellas. Still though, there is no progress in this aspect to speak of.- Needle ControlAgain, most of the progress here is theory and simple practical excises designed to allow people to get a feel for aiming a projectile. Advanced geometry is a subject of common study - specifically relating to angels - and art classes are also mandatory for teaching students the fundamentals of perspective.	3	4	2	Shorten the Grip: The hand hold for using the razor edge until well into the shinobi's career. Your right hand is literally grasping as far up the spear as it can go with your other just shy of a foot below that one. This grip gives you the most control over the edge blades but it's not meant to be used extensively - instead designed to have the user drop into this grip for a quick strike or two before returning to their spear stance.		7	7	0	0	0	6	0	0	0
871	3	3	Under One Umbrella 	Aiaigasa	- Spear OffenceWith the foundations down and refined at this point it becomes vital that the student expand his repertoire and start training in the more advanced techniques of his style. More and more emphasis is placed onto a style of light work designed to allow the user to engage multiple opponents with simple thrusting techniques refined through hours of countless practice. The use of the razor edge has also been much improved upon and should the user find himself pressed into close quarters he is more than capable of continuing a fight with competence.- Shield DefenceThe basic for of defending with the shield portion becomes apparent here - the shield is not a tool for those who fight using the spear forms - but a tool for those who fight up close using the edge forms. In CQB, it becomes essential to ensure an opponent's weapon is stopped before it reaches the student and as such blocking is a vital tool to ensure the user remains unharmed.- Flight ControlAt last a break through and it is at this stage in the training that the user finally learns how to bare an Umbrella aloft. Just one single Umbrella mind you, and once you've thrown it as your attack action it will remain in the air for 2 posts in the exact location that you want it to be in. Choose where you want it to be carefully though because if you want it to relocate then moving it will require your full concentration and a lack of any other action.- Needle ControlWith the first secrets of flight control under your belt it goes without saying that you have also learnt the basics of shooting needles from your Yang Umbrella. It takes your concentration to aim and fire anything at this stage simply because of the difficulties in aiming shots for something that shares a different line of sight to your own, and the rate of fire for the needles themselves isn't particularly fast.	3	4	2	Scattered Showers: Sustained fire from an Umbrella is incredibly difficult to achieve, and single shots are inaccurate for the most part to say the least. Therefore the user adopts a 'shotgun' practice that fires off a quick volley of needles that are designed to spread slightly - therefore improving the chances of the needles hitting. Generally speaking, you can fire an amount of needles per Umbrella for this volley equal to your tactics stat - the higher that stat the more accomplished you are at shooting with your Umbrellas.		10	10	0	0	0	8	0	0	0
871	4	4	Under One Umbrella 	Aiaigasa	- Spear OffenceThe user has not only become familiar with his weapon at this point, but they have also become hardened by experience in battle. A missed thrust can be turned into a side swipe to catch an enemy off guard while you step back and keep him at your perfect range. Attacks with the edges are now brutally efficient and capable of causing potentially lethal, jagged gashes against anyone foolish enough to think an Umbrella user can't fight up close.- Shield DefenceAt this stage, the shield has become a tactical corner stone in the user's ability to fight at maximum effectiveness. Firstly, it is used to close the distance between an opponent and the shinobi while providing a sheet of cover against any potential attack. Secondly, its use as a method of protection against those who get too close has been refined to the point where the user may divert an attack to one side - off the Umbrella's rounded surface - before striking into the ensuing opening with the edges of your weapon. While far from perfect, the user is able to adapt quickly to different angles of attack by repositioning his Umbrella to cover his most vital locations,though it is exceptionally hard to predict exactly where an attack will strike (thus limiting counter effectiveness to a degree).- Flight ControlBasic technique has been thankfully refined into a more versatile and thankfully more manoeuvrable. The user is capable of flying the Umbrella while engaging in other actions such as acrobatics, reading a book or what have you. Also, the Umbrella is capable of staying aloft for 3 posts now before it needs to be re-thrown.- Needle ControlConstant practice has sharpened the user's accuracy several degrees - though in most cases the user has learnt that quantity over quality is usually the best solution. Naturally, this means that rate of fire has increased somewhat and, with it, combat effectiveness. Much like the above, the user may fire the Umbrella without concentrating but they cannot move the Umbrella if they fire and vice versa unless they concentrate.	3	4	2	Open Towards the Rain: A defensive technique that starts with the user's Umbrella closed. As an attack approaches the ninja he steps forwards and violently opens his Umbrella towards it. The quick gust of wind, coupled with the shield actually impacting the enemy attack, serves to dampen the force of the oncoming blow.		14	17	12	0	0	14	0	0	0
871	5	5	Under One Umbrella 	Aiaigasa	- Spear OffenceMotions here are natural and easy to the user. They can quickly shift positions and still steady their spear against a charging enemy, and even when using the edges or the shaft of your Umbrella it is the fluidity of motion that is key - the ability to move from one technique into the next. Also, the range of the spear is beginning to increase at this stage thanks to the user's steadily improving strength allowing him to maintain control of the Umbrella even if it is held towards the end of the shaft.- Shield DefenceWhile the practitioner's ability to accurately responded to attacks - specifically of the ranged variety - has continued to improve, using the shield as a method of protection in close battle has finally begun to take a back seat. Because the user has finally learnt fully how to fight on the move, and coupled with the spear's steadily improving range of attack, defence has begun to rely more upon keeping an enemy at bay or inviting them to over extend themselves for a counter attack.- Flight ControlMuch of the user's improvement in this aspect can clearly be seen in their ability to hold two Umbrellas aloft at the same time now. Naturally, your ability to control your Umbrella has also increased and without concentrating you may take up two actions with your Umbrellas (move both Umbrellas, move and shoot with one, move one and shoot with the other, etc). Though you may opt to forgo any other offensive actions on your part to control both your Umbrellas to their full at one time. The Umbrellas are capable of staying aloft for 4 posts before they need to be re thrown.- Needle ControlThis stage of training hasn't improved much over the last stage in regards to a single Umbrella simply because all the focus has gone into learning how to aim and fire with two Umbrellas. In all regards, the practitioner can judge where a projectile thrown from any angel will hit by reflex at this stage and with it comes an improved ability to aim at a moving target. Individual rate of fire has also failed to improve at this stage, but when you account for the second Umbrella it becomes obvious that the overall rate of fire has practically doubled.	3	4	2	Step for the Lunge: A purely offensive technique, this move is a charging technique that puts the practitioners entire body into a single strike. With one hand at the very end of the Umbrella (positioned next to the user's hip) and the other further up the Umbrella to steady the weapon the user dashes forewords and pivots around - twisting their hips and putting their body's weight onto their forwards leg - while lunging with the spear. This attack easily has an attack range of eight feet and is quite dangerous. Recovery is usually handled via stepping off to one side, away from your opponent while you retrieve the spear.		19	23	15	0	0	16	0	0	0
871	6	6	Under One Umbrella 	Aiaigasa	- Spear OffenceThe practitioner is finally bestowed the title of master at this level of skill and, while one is far from flawless, the user is truly a force to be reckoned with. No one has ever really called the Aiaigasa a truly a mobile style, but at this stage the master has finally shifted from a defensive style to one that prizes the first strike and training focuses on this aspect by imprinting reflexive actions designed to go for the least defended vital point on the target's body. Attacks with the razor edges have also improved but using them for close combat has been disregarded in so much as they've begun to be used for attacking multiple opponents (for the slash is more wide reaching than the thrust).- Shield DefenceAccuracy of defence is perfect at this stage and if the user can perceive an attack he may place his shield at the point of optimum protection (taking in factors such as attack speed and power of course). The largest improvement seen here though is the master's ability to let his Umbrella 'roll with a blow' - moving the Umbrella backwards at high speed to dampen the impact of a projectile for example. Overall, this allows the user to protect against more dangerous techniques while still preserving his Umbrella.- Flight ControlConstant and rigorous practice has refined the user's ability to control his Umbrellas to a practical point of expertise. Both Umbrellas are capable of full action without much interference on the user's part - though the actual movements themselves are far from what one would call acrobatic. Still, if the user concentrates he can show off with some pretty dazzling aerial acrobatics. The time aloft limit has risen to 5 posts.- Needle ControlThanks in part to the master's increased ability to control his Umbrellas, he has finally dedicated an entire stage of training solely to rate of fire. Previously, most shots were taken in bursts to ensure maximum coverage but now they are capable of maintaining a fairly sustained rate of fire. Accuracy has increased along side this solely due to the user's increased practical experience, and when combined with the aforementioned improvement these Umbrella have actually become quite lethal.	3	4	2	Blue Skies, Eight Sun Thrust: A devastating technique that may be used alongside any thrust. If the Umbrella is closed and the user manages to score a deep stab wound onto the opponent he may open the Umbrella as the spear blade passes into the enemy's flesh. This has the effect of widening the size of the wound dramatically - turning a normal thrusting wound into a gaping hole.		25	28	22	0	18	18	0	0	0
871	7	7	Under One Umbrella 	Aiaigasa	- Spear OffenceThe absolute pinnacle of ability; at this level of skill the user is flawless beyond reproach. Their 'spear' has literally become a barrier between the user and his prey through which only death lies. Thrusts and swipes can be executed while the shinobi holds only the furthest end of the shaft effortlessly - giving the master an unparalleled range of attack - and that coupled with their sheer strength and skill combine to turn a single stab into a lethal attack from well beyond another taijutsu user's reach.- Shield DefenceThe shield like properties of the Umbrella is, at this stage, neigh-perfect though overall defence at this stage is downplayed. In fact, if an Aiaigasa master is defending himself against another weapons user then something is horribly wrong, but that doesn't mean he can't. Regardless, this is mostly employed at close range where the master parries blows off the rounded Umbrella before instantly countering with the razor edge with no margin of error - giving him the ability to take a step back and go for the killing thrust.- Flight ControlWhile the user may still only have two Umbrellas in the air at one time, he has learned how to control both of them with no effort. In effect, the user no longer needs chakra strings to control his weapons and they are fully capable of following the user's subtle chakra commands to swoop and wheel into position. Tactical disposition has become almost second nature and each tool instinctively shifts to cover the most optimum firing arc. The time these Umbrellas can spend in the air is now 8 posts before the user needs to catch and re-throw them into the air.- Needle ControlAchieving perfect accuracy isn't difficult - that was after all obtained long ago - but to be able to perfectly trace a line of fire from a moving flying Umbrella that's perhaps twenty feet to your left and shooting at a moving target with near spot on aim is more than difficult, but now at last it is mastered. Rate of fire has stayed for the most part the same but the more efficient application of firepower - and more Umbrellas - has greatly increased the lethality of this aspect.	3	4	2	Drops of Water, Rain of Steel: By using both Umbrellas in concert, the master has hover side by side, close by each other. Each Umbrella then fires off as many as twice the normal amount of needles as it is able to over an incredibly wide area. The sheer spread creates what amounts to a wall of blades that are almost impossible to just avoid.		33	36	30	0	26	26	0	0	0
870	1	1	Nise Style Spirit Possession	None	Sphere Control: 0The student here focuses on the learning the basic form of the style. The user draws out their own spiritual energy and soul, and combines them with chakra to create a spectral essence which then possesses a source of mystical water, i.e. Water of the Well. The user then falls into a deep sleep, while from this source emerges a wraith-like form made of water. This spectre which is fully controlled by the user's spirit, typically has two arms though the rest of the body varies from user to user, and hovers about 0.5 meters above the ground. The body of the wraith appears vaporous and insubstantial, as it is made up of lightly suspended water particles. Any attack will cause the spectral form to dissipate. The dissipated form will however reconstitute instantly consuming a Water of the Well minor wound charge. Thus the overall style is limited by the mystical resources the user has remaining. Once the wraith is dissipated without resources remaining to reconstitute, his spirit returns to his sleeping body with the aid of his spirit guide and he awakens.		3		Wraith Form: Arm ExtensionThis is a passive ability which allows the wraith to stretch and extend its arms by an additional arms length. It also defines the number of arms the wraith can possess (Base is two arms).Stage 2: Technique is extended to two additional arms lengths instead. Allowing for further throwing range, and high speed projectiles.Stage 5: Can now create a third arm for the user to extend and utilize.Stage 6: Can now create a fourth arm for the user to extend and utilize.	Wraith Form: Healing TouchWhile in Wraith form the mystical properties of the Wall of the Well are enhanced to be able to be used to seal wounds of non-clan members as well, this requires the wraith to make contact with the wound. For major wounds it may only be used once per thread.	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	4	0
870	2	2	Nise Style Spirit Possession	None	Sphere Control: 1Here the student remains focused on the basics aspects of control and movement. Though primarily still a support and scouting technique at this stage, the user begins to grasp his first offensive and defensive abilities.Wraith Form: SoakWhile the user can easily phase through small object and bars due to his physical composition, he can now also soak his form inside a solid porous object (e.g. wall) and emerge on the other side if he/she so wished. Maximum object thickness in order to emerge the other side is 0.5m, otherwise user has to emerge the same side they entered. When Soak is used in combat it utilizes a Kawarimi usage.Wraith Form: Pressure SphereWith this the user begins to form his first sphere, roughly the size of a fist (but ultimately can generate spheres equal to his Sphere Control). The basic forms of sphere generation is practiced here, in which the student forms a watery membrane and then draws on excess spiritual energy from the Ancestral Realm to fill it (giving it a form of pressure). This can then thrown by the user as a blunt force cannonball. This particular variation is favored by projectile specialists.Stage 3: Spheres now explode on contact with kinetic energy equal to an explosive pouch.		3				0	0	0	0	6	0	7	7	0
870	3	3	Nise Style Spirit Possession	None	Sphere Control: 2Now comfortable with the basic control of the wraith form, the user begins to utilize more advanced techniques. The first of which is to fill the body with excess spiritual energy, allowing it to take on a more substantial form and access more techniques. This is fundamental to beginning to use the wraith for close combat taijutsu, however this does not allow the wraith to wield weapons yet. At this stage the wraith has become more durable, and will not always dissipate from every attack. Twice per thread the wraith may instantly recover a severed wraith limb, instead of completely dissipating an reconstituting (this does not use up wound charges).		3			Wraith Form: Painful TouchWith this technique, spiritual energy is concentrated at the wraith's hands, upon physical contact this causes the target to feel pain as if being burned. The pain at this stage is a precursor of what would eventually come with advancement in this style.Stage 4: Technique becomes Wraith Form: Flesh-eating Touch. Chakra in the hands now cause an corrosive effect which eats away at living flesh (it has no effect on other substances), thus turning the pain of the original variation into reality. Prolonged contact would eventually eat to the bone, but is hard to maintain due to the vulnerabilities of the wraith form and the amount of resources it would need to reconstitute in close combat several times.	0	0	0	0	8	0	10	10	0
870	4	4	Nise Style Spirit Possession	None	Sphere Control: 3Now that the student has mastered the pressurizing the form of the wraith he begins to practise other styles of taijutsu in his spectral state. The user can now use other taijutsu styles in wraith form, adding their taijutsu bonuses to the stats of the wraith.		3			Wraith Form: Pressure WeaponThe user can now form a pressurized weapon of water and spiritual energy to be utilized in pressurized wraith form. With this he/she can form a single weapon of up to Item cost 3. Weapons are as durable as their real world counterparts, but if broken can be reconstituted by expending a minor wound charge.Stage 5: Additionally the user can now form up to three weapons of Item cost 3 or less.Stage 6: User can now form up to four weapons.Wraith Form: Barrier SphereBy now the user has realized that one of the key weaknesses of the style is its reliance on the mystical water resource, and that some attempts to preserve the wraith form is necessary. With this technique variation the user can form a sphere of mystical water around the wraith body which blocks techniques up to Stage 3. As the technique is limited to form around the wraith only, the user has to position the spectre to intercept an attack if he wishes to defend an ally or his original body.Stage 5: The user can now form a shield around his sleeping body as well. Blocks techniques up to Stage 4.Stage 6: The user can now form a shield around a number of allies including his sleeping body equal to his Sphere Control. Blocks techniques up to Stage 5.	0	0	0	0	14	0	16	17	10
870	5	5	Nise Style Spirit Possession	None	Sphere Control: 4At this stage the user begins to access the finer aspects of the pressurized form and begins to manipulate air pressure around the wraith allowing his the ability to speak in pressurized wraith form. With this he can now issue Kourekai commands in this form (Koureikai - Communing with the Spirits required), relinquishing the permanent guard duty his spirit companion is usually charged with in this style. This marks the point at which the user begins to accept the real risks of utilizing the style, and is prepared to die in it's usage.		3			Wraith Form: Hydro ScreamThe wraith mimics the screams of the banshees of the Ancestral realm, but instead of sonic energy launches a torrent of pressurized water at a target from the wraith's mouth that is accompanied by a deafening shriek. The pressured torrent has a range of 10 meters, and can be held from up to 2 posts. The user may rotate and tilt his head during this period to control the torrential beam, but his main body is fixed in place. The shriek lasts as long as the beam is held, and radiates outward 50 meters in all directions indiscriminately deafening friend and foe alike.	0	0	0	0	16	0	20	21	15
870	6	6	Nise Style Spirit Possession	None	Sphere Control: 8The user has started to master control and manipulation of the spiritual pressure and in and around their constructs, and gains the ability to fly/hover up to 10 meters in the air.		3			Wraith Form: Pressure Sphere ManipulationWith this the user no longer creates and throws spheres, but instead controls them through the air by manipulating the air pressure around each sphere with spiritual energy. The spheres have grown to the size of a beach ball, and the user can generate and control a number of spheres equal to his Sphere Control. Spheres now however can be triggered to explode at any time, and with the force of an explosive tag. The spheres may be controlled up to 30 meters away from the wraith.	0	0	0	0	20	16	28	28	19
870	7	7	Nise Style Spirit Possession	None	Sphere Control: 16The final capabilities of the wraith is achieved in which it gains the ability to fly/hover up to 100 meters in the air. Outside of combat it may transform its arms into large wings and traverse great distances within seconds. In its winged form it may carry a number of allies with it equal to its Sphere Control. These allies (including his sleeping body) are contained within air pressurized water spheres that trail behind the winged wraith in flight.		3			Wraith Form: Depths of the WellThe technique creates four spherical portals (1 m in diameter) of spiritual energy which float around the user, these portals then fill themselves with water summoned directly from the Well of Bones. With this the user gains access to water-based techniques of up to Stage 6 (ninjutsu or otherwise, but cannot be used for genjutsu) that he knows in wraith form, but they have to utilize the floating orbs of water as a source. Each externally known water technique used consumes one of the four spheres, but does not consume a jutsu usage.	0	0	0	0	27	17	36	37	26
869	1	1	Chitin Manipulation	Armored Core	Chitin FormationOnly one general type of chitin can be created, a thin layer not unlike hardened leather which coats the skin. The armor also gives the user the ability to regulate their body temperature better. Thin chitin armor may be layered both on itself and onto other armor types. The added weight means every layer added past the first reduces speed level by 1. Thin chitin armor can take on variety of appearances as well to suit the Maeda's taste.Combat AbilityThe Maeda fighting style focuses on simple blocks and strikes aimed primarily at exploiting whatever armor they are wearing at that moment. The inherent flexibility of the art means many Maeda have their own personal flair when fighting. The basics of the style are derived from old Rain military combat training, giving the Maeda an additional bonus of knowing what to expect whenever facing soldiers above ground.			3	One piece of armor can be generated per post. There are five areas the Maeda can choose between to cover within that time frame: both arms and hands, both legs and feet, the upper and lower torso, the upper and lower back, or the neck/head. Previous armor must be discarded before a new piece can grow in its place.Chitin armor is grafted into the skin itself, which makes physical removal difficult when the user must move around in damaged plates. The skill of casting off allows the Maeda to 'shed' parts of their armor in a post. Only one piece of armor can be shed per post, and armor cannot be regenerated over the shed limb until the following post.	Speed: MantisDescription: This ability mimics the mantids scythe like arms, granting the ability to attach two foot long curved blades on any piece of armor. Normally these blades are placed on the arms or legs, but can be placed on any piece of armor. These blades carry a sharp edge but highly brittle, and will break when striking anything harder than leather armor.Base Stage: Up to two feet long, glass-like bladesStage Two: Up to three feet long, glass-like bladesStage Three: Up to three feet long, steel-like bladesStamina: IsopodDescription: A strictly defensive measure, this technique segments any piece of armor and grants it increased flexibility and sturdiness to striking forces. This effectively grants the armor additional durability, letting it survive one hit it otherwise wouldn't. In addition armor with this modification can be retracted completely into the skin, as to be undetectable. Isopod armor grants no bonuses while retracted.Strength: TickDescription: Tiny hooked thorns like those found on bloodsucking bugs are grown across the piece of armor. These thorns catch on just about anything, from skin to hair to even weapons. Tick armor also improves the grip of the shinobi, allowing them to climb certain obstacles easier much like shuko. The hooks themselves can be adjusted as well, growing an even coating of spikes up to one inch long across any piece of modified armor.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	4
869	2	2	Chitin Manipulation	Armored Core	Chitin FormationAt this stage the user achieves mastery of the thin armor chitin, allowing for the coverage of two body parts with thin chitin in one post. Additionally, the Maeda can adjust the color of the armor when formed to whatever suits their needs and are capable of camouflaged patterns much like the creatures the karamushi typically mimic (this is not optic camouflage).Combat AbilityThe user is taught not so much how to fight, but how to learn to fight- each Maeda adapts the karamushi to suit their own tastes. Fundamentally all users are taught to be adaptable and to build their armor to fit the task. More emphasis is placed on learning the ins and outs of battle tactics rather than on how to win a one-on-one fight.			3	The user may reattach a broken piece of armor over the course of one post. Most of the time chitin armor shatters in too many pieces for this skill to be used in battle, however if one large piece (such as a modification) breaks off it can be reattached to the piece if was broken from.Being prepared is important, and thus a Maeda will often have pieces of armor already ready to go before the action starts. The Maeda may start a thread with one piece of armor already formed, with one additional piece available for every stage in this list known past the second.	Speed: VespidDescription: The species known commonly as wasps are famous for their modified ovipositors, which when stabbed into a victim inject some foreign substance. Because the karamushi only mimic the husks of other organisms, the Maeda cannot recreate the venom usually used by these insects. However, the long, sharp needle can still be used for it's original purpose- laying eggs inside hosts. This allows the user to grow up to two foot long spikes on any piece of armor. If these spikes enter a living body, the user will inject karamushi spawn into the unfortunate victim. The immediate effect of being filled with worms is typically nausea and lightheadedness. The ovipositors created are notoriously fragile and will break off once puncturing something or being attacked, and will continue pumping in karamushi until removed if they are broken off inside a host organism.Base Effect: Up to one foot long, needles break upon attackingStage Three: Up to one feet long, needles will remain attached if desired.Stage Four: Up to two feet long, needles reform after breaking.Stamina: HerculesDescription: Occasionally called the 'king of the insects', the Hercules beetle boasts a mighty horn on its exoskeleton that it uses mostly for attracting mates. This allows the user to modify their armor with a two foot long and relatively thick horn-shaped bundle of chitin. The horn itself is a heavy, sturdy construction, much like tonfa, and can end in a hook or a trident-shape if the user wishes. If grown on a helmet piece, the Maeda will gain the ability to headbutt freely without injuring themselves in the process. In addition to it's other properties, Hercules armor is so tightly weaved that it can withstand massive, uniform shocks like those of an explosion. This protection applies to all armor with this modification, not just helmets.Base Effect: Up to two feet long horns, can withstand one exploding tag (or explosion-tag force technique) before crumbling.Stage Three: Up to three feet long horns, can withstand three exploding tags worth of force before crumbling.Stage Four: Up to four feet long horns, complete explosion resistance.	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	7	7
869	3	3	Chitin Manipulation	Armored Core	Chitin FormationThis stage marks the introduction to a new armor type: plated chunks. The karamushi now produce an extremely dense type of chitin which turns hard and lumpy upon exposure to the air. The Maeda have enough control of the karamushi to form these rocky looking chitin blisters evenly across their skin, commonly giving them a 'trollish' look. This armor is extremely noticeable but very good at dulling blunt blows and deflecting cutting attacks. Stabbing attacks still cause problems, and precisely aimed blows can still reach the areas in between the lumps. Rough chitin may be grown over already existing armor. The extra thickness makes attacking difficult and every layer added past the first reduces strength level by 1. One body part can be covered per post.Combat AbilityEmphasis is placed on using the mantis and vespid modifications to strike critical points in opponents such as the neck or joints. The basic striking and blocking is at this point usually assisted with some small offhand bladed weapon such as a kunai or small blade, as it is often useful to pair up their somewhat weak armor with something more sturdy.			3	The user may instantly cast pieces of armor off while moving. This is primarily used for surprise projectile attacks using the chitin armor as an improvised weapon. Regular armor regeneration rules still apply.	Speed: ScorpionDescription: Using chain-like chitin structures the user can grow up to two ten-foot long 'ropes' per piece of armor, which are hooked at the end much like that of a scorpion's tail. Like with the wasps, the stinger lacks the ability to inject poison but can inject eggs and live karamushi causing nausea and light-headedness. The stinger is highly robust and can even support the weight of the shinobi, allowing the ropes to be used much like a grappling hook as the stingers and rope can be freely retracted. It can be cut just like any rope, however.Base Stage: 10 feet lengthStage Four: 30 feet lengthStage Five: 60 feet lengthStrength: CrustaceanDescription: The crustacean adaptation grants the user the ability to generate two massive foot wide crab claws on their armor. The original Rain expedition was famously infected repeatedly by karamushi posing as swamp crustaceans, giving this technique a joke reputation as a the forbidden Maeda 'nightmare technique'. The claw itself can clamp down with the same grip force as the user has and is a solid construct, equivalent to bone in strength. A common tactic used by the Maeda is to grab an enemy, pin their arm or weapon to the ground (or any other solid object), then detach the armor. The claws will remain clamped if detached and require at least one post to remove (or broken if the target's strength can normally shatter bone). This technique causes little damage by itself, and is primarily one used for disarming or restraining others. Claws may be grown on the feet for added gripping ability on slippery surfaces.	0	0	8	0	0	0	0	10	10
869	4	4	Chitin Manipulation	Armored Core	Chitin FormationTwo body parts can be covered with chunk plate per post. The user is still limited to two pieces of armor formed per post, but may mix and match their armor types however they wish (IE, forming two different types of armor in one post).Combat AbilityStress falls on combinations of techniques at this stage. Each Maeda fights differently, and while some are brawlers and others crafty trap setters, all know the ins and outs of their skills well enough to be thinking several steps ahead in combat. Planning is critical to a Maeda's success, as the long cooldowns between armor generation can still leave them vulnerable if they make a mistake in the heat of battle. The typical Maeda battle movement consists of relatively long moments of avoiding or deflecting attacks, followed by an immediate combo or rapid succession of attacks when an opening presents itself.			3	When it becomes necessary, the user may now choose to retract chitin weapons into the armor, concealing them entirely much like a hidden blade. The retraction takes a bit of time, and thus can't be done mid-attack or mid-parry.The Maeda may also launch armor modifications out of the armor. These projectiles always travel at the same speed and are difficult to aim, but can provide a nasty surprise when done without warning. The armor permanently loses the modification when this technique is used, and a new piece must be generated to re-use this technique.	Stamina: CentipedeDescription: The centipede modification 'segments' armor much like the isopod method, however in this case the armor is not grafted to the user's flesh. Centipede modified armor can be removed without penalty and worn by other individuals, though the same one-post cooldown on armor generation still applies. Thin chitin will appear much like thick robes, lumped chitin will feel more like rough chain mail, and plated armor does not change appearance much but is notoriously slimy to the touch.Strength: FlatwormDescription: Like the worms, this armor excretes a sticky slime. The slime is regenerative to chitin exoskeletons and thus flatworm armor cannot be broken except by the Maeda themselves. Damaged armor will regenerate within the same post. The user can still be hurt, but the armor will always return to the state it was in at the beginning of the post if damaged, regenerating around any weapons that might be stuck inside.	0	0	14	0	0	0	14	15	14
869	5	5	Chitin Manipulation	Armored Core	Chitin FormationThis stage of the karamushi development gives a new armor type to manipulate: sheer plate. Plate armor is formed in angular protrusions from the skin, often appearing to 'burst' out from underneath the dermis, occasionally accompanied by a bloody spray (the blood itself is from the karamushi, the user is unharmed). Plate chitin sits in between light chitin and rough chitin in terms of defensive properties. It provides immense penetration protection, decent cutting defense, but breaks easily under blunt attacks. The plates themselves are similar to steel in strength, though they can be crushed and bent much easier. Plate chitin may be grown over already existing armor, with no penalty. Plate chitin grants one additional benefit in its construction, as every piece of plate can be broken off to form a sharp edge. One body part can be covered per post.Combat AbilityThe immense arsenal of abilities available to the Maeda by this stage in their development means that fighting style is less about rigid memorization of stances and strikes but more about adapting their body to fit the situation. One on one fighting focuses on landing quick killing blows with the more fragile armor types, fighting when outnumbered tends to emphasize wearing down the foes rather than going for a certain kill, and when aided by teammates the style revolves around making openings for others to exploit.			3		Speed: GrasshopperDescription: Grasshopper armor shares the huge stress tolerance of its namesake, granting any piece of armor immense resistance to sheering forces. Grasshopper leg armor gives the shinobi the ability to jump up to 15 meters in the air and land similar distances without fear of injury. All other grasshopper armor is extremely springy and pliant, able to reflect back one taijutsu or projectile attack per post so long as it is two stages below the user's max stage in this list. This ability has a one post cooldown before it can be used again, and the grasshopper armor exhibits signs of stress (loud cracking, shape distortion, etc) while cooling down.Strength: AntDescription: Proportionally, ants are some of the strongest creatures for their size. Ant armor contains the same super efficient micro-structures that allow ants to lift many times their own weight, granting this same ability to whatever limb is being covered by the armor. Armor covering the arm will grant the Maeda the ability to (slowly) lift extremely heavy objects up to fifty times their own weight, leg armor will grant them the ability to plant their feet and become virtually immovable for up to three stages of strength higher than their own. Ant strength is not transferred into attacks and only works when applied with extreme focus and attention (IE, only when used on inanimate objects or outside combat).	0	0	16	0	0	0	18	20	18
869	6	6	Chitin Manipulation	Armored Core	Chitin FormationTwo pieces of plate armor may be generated per post, with the maximum number of armor pieces generated per post still limited to 2.Combat AbilityIt is said that a Maeda with this level of skill is like a parasite in that they will 'always eventually find a way in'. Like any shinobi the Maeda can still be beaten, but the clan tends to view such incidences as cases of hubris rather than lack of options. The biggest weakness of the Maeda is fighting those who can attack more than one way, as each armor type still has weaknesses which can be exploited.			3	With a great amount of skill and concentration, the user may swap out modifications on a piece of armor once per post with no penalty. This skill is difficult enough that it can only be done once every four posts.	Stamina: CicadaDescription: Like a newly molted cicada the Maeda 'splits' away from their chitin shell, leaving behind in its place a perfect, hollow replica of the piece. Rather than having a naked limb left after the split, the user instead has a completely new set of armor waiting underneath. Cicada armor allows the user to freely switch between their armor types at will, just by shedding the oldest version (IE, the user forms X new pieces of armor per post to replace the old, where X is however many pieces they were already wearing).	0	16	20	0	0	0	21	28	26
869	7	7	Chitin Manipulation	Armored Core	Chitin FormationThe final stage signifies nothing short of complete integration of the karamushi within the Maeda. Three pieces of armor may be formed at once. The user now 'feels' their armor much as though it were their own skin. As evidence of their master of chitin manipulation, the user may now place up to two modifications on a single piece of armor.			3	The Maeda never truly dominate or control the parasites within them, instead only manipulating the karamushi's natural behavior for their own benefit. With great focus, however, the user can briefly gain direct power over the worms living in their bones. Once per thread the user may force the karamushi to sacrifice themselves in order to generate five pieces of armor from the bodies of the parasite in a single post. The use of this technique kills every adult in the body of the Maeda and thus renders them unable to generate any more armor for the remainder of the thread.	Speed: HornetDescription: Hornet armor converts the raw power of natural hornets into rigid wing structures which can spread up to six feet in wingspan. The wings are capable of beating and vibrating with enough intensity to blow away projectiles or lightweight jutsu (below stage 5). The wind generated by these wings is similar to what one would expect from a tessen wielding shinobi. In addition, the wings can vibrate and 'blur' the body part covered by the hornet armor, making that body part's movements and exact location difficult to perceive. Wings placed on the back of the torso grant limited flight, effectively allowing the shinobi to hover, glide, and move through the air at half their current speed level for one post, with a one post cooldown.Stamina: CockroachDescription: Roach armor transfers this amazing resilience to the user in the form of high unbreakable armor. Any piece of roach armor will survive two blows that would normally shatter it. The roach adaptation lives up to its namesake and protects the user at all costs, as any broken limb covered with the armor will be integrated so closely with the muscle itself that the Maeda can completely bypass the need for bone to support movement. This grants the user full functionality of broken limbs, so long as the armor is intact. There are even stories of roach-helmets keeping Maeda alive even after their hosts have had their heads severed, so powerful is this integration.Strength: StagDescription: The jaws of the mighty stag are proportionally some of the strongest on the planet. Stag armor comes equipped with a pair rock shattering jaws, up to two feet wide across (but can be made smaller). These jaws can crinkle steel in their iron grip and easily cleave through flesh. Not only are the mandibles of the stag strong, they can snap shut in the blink of an eye, allowing the user to intercept attacks immediately by locking their jaws around the weapon or projectile and effectively stopping it in its tracks. The mandibles created by this technique are even controllable when separated from the shinobi, allowing them to lay bear-trap style traps with jaws powerful enough to completely sever the lower leg off anyone who bumbles into one.	0	18	18	0	0	0	26	34	27

868	4	4	Ghost Touch	Reisouhou	Time measurement is the new factor of this Stage. By comparing the difference in Depth level of one person's River between two locations, one will know the amount of time it took for the target to journey from one location to the other. This is useful if one requires a time frame on the target's actions and the speed of their travel, when they used a ninjutsu or genjutsu, how long said technique lasted for, and so on.At this point, the user has gained enough skills so not to require prior contact to follow their trail. Instead they can substitute facial meeting with items that have been in the target's possession for extended periods of time. Things such as a family heirloom they've always kept on person, a piece of jewelery they've always worn or a treasured weapon or armor they've had since childhood.Depth - 20 daysBloodline Range - 5 meters sphere radiusFunction Reading - The user may now read genjutsu functions outside of battle.						0	0	0	12	0	0	11	12	0
868	5	5	Ghost Touch	Reisouhou	Sometimes one just don't have the luxury of a River example to follow upon. At those times, they utilize a process termed 'Sieving'. For this they require details of the target's last known locations, approximate time they were at those places and, in case of shinobi, possible Clarity. One then visits the places, expands their Reisouhou and 'shift' through all the chakra residue present. Using Depth as a time-estimate they narrow the possibilities to the Rivers with same time-frame as their information. They then repeat the process at any other known locations and hopefully identify one River that's present at all locations, each at the correct time-frames and perchance similar Clarity. While it is both tedious and inexact, one hopes the weight of possibility of a perfect fit will deliver the correct target.Depth - 1 MonthBloodline Range - 8 meter sphere radiusFunction Reading - It is now possible for one to read the Functions of techniques during battle, but they must constantly be within bloodline radius vicinity and consume one full post to decipher the handseals.

868	6	6	Ghost Touch	Reisouhou	While previous levels may aided the movements of a subject, this Stage now grants a much more detailed insight into both their actions and their physical state. The most prominent example is a user's ability to draw up a detailed recount of a battle site. Not only are they able to follow the movements, speed and jutsu used by those in the fight, but they've gained enough knowledge to include a myriad of other attacks. Sudden bursts of pure chakra are most likely taijutsu Special Attacks, a collection of River threads through the air may be puppet strings or chakra-controlled projectiles or wires. Large blasts of chakra the center of which is an Explode Function distinguishes explosive tags. Collection of Functions that would normally be considered unstable for the lack of form, quantity, substance and non-effect Functions may be attributed to weapons imbued with seals for added power. Abnormal fluctuations in River Clarity signals drop in health or forceful increase in chakra power. It is not perfect, for the Reisouhou can not detect anything that was achieved without aid of chakra or handseals, nor can they find information regarding bloodline abilities or body seals. But aside from that, at this level they are capable of walking through most aspects of a battle step by step.Depth - 2 monthBloodline Range - 15 meters sphere radiusFunction Reading - During battle, the user may now shorten the duration it takes to decipher a technique's Functions to one action, providing they make direct contact with said technique.

867	1	1	Space-Time Ninja Techniques	Jinkukan Ninjutsu	Sealing Arts - The first study of sealing techniques involves placing inert objects into a seal. This seal is a visible, chakra-etched rune that can look in any number of ways - - painted ink, flame-seared, scratched into place with a fingernail, and so on. Inert objects are any tool the Tachibana can pick up with one hand that are not infused with chakra, most typically shinobi weaponry or other small, mundane objects. Anyone with shinobi training can break these seals, either through an application of chakra, or offering a small blood sacrifice to disrupt the seal. Sealing objects in this way never costs a jutsu usage, and is a fundamental building block of the rest of the style. Items released from seals first appear with a flurry of an obscuring material (such as smoke, crow's feathers, or tattered paper) and the items rapidly return to real space. This moment of release, while quick, is enough for trained combatants to react.Shunpo - Once per thread per stage in this style, the Tachibana can perform a feat of rapid movement by internally manipulating their chakra coils. They can move up to a number of meters equal to -3 of their Taijutsu Speed Scaling, with a minimum of 1 meter.					(Specials: Intelligence 2, Tactics 2)Crow Art: Slide - By expending a Stage 1 usage, but without handseals, the Tachibana may slide on any surface they could regularly run on (dependent on their shinobi training in Wall and Water Walking). This slide is relatively uncontrolled, but the Tachibana stays upright and can move their body around as long as one balancing limb stays on the surface. This allows for tricky movement on the battlefield, such as maintaining momentum forward while turning around. This technique leaves a tell of crow feathers behind, that dissolve a few seconds later into dust.Crow Art: Pathfinder - By performing a series of handseals and a Stage 1 usage, the Tachibana generates several small ethereal feathers, pearlescent and glistening. These feathers spiral out from the body and then gently brush the ground forward, seeking a path to the Tachibana-s goal. (The Tachibana must be fully aware of the goal, for instance, 'a mile north' or 'to the top of this mountain pass', not a hidden goal such as 'find the lost object'.) The feathers detect very mundane forms of traps (such as tripwires or trap holes) and alert the caster by a ghostly whisper in the ear. This technique cannot uncover traps made by skilled trap-makers or anything formed by ninjutsu techniques. The pathfinding will, however, help the Tachibana lead a party through dangerous terrain such as swamplands, up difficult climbing paths, or even discover dangerous currents in a river. The Tachibana can maintain this technique indefinitely, but they must maintain their final handseal during the technique and maintain concentration. Casting any other form of ninjutsu or entering combat immediately causes the feathers to disappear.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	4
867	2	2	Space-Time Ninja Techniques	Jinkukan Ninjutsu	Sealing Arts - The Tachibana may seal any inert object that they could otherwise lift naturally (with their own body-s strength, unassisted by other ninjutsu). The Tachibana-s seals are more robust now, meaning that they take a Stage 1 application of chakra or the seal must be physically destroyed to release. The Tachibana themselves may release the seal at no cost. The Tachibana does not pay a usage for sealing mundane items.Shunpo - The distance of the Tachibana-s shunpo is now up to a number of meters equal to -2 of their Taijutsu Speed Scaling, with a minimum of 1 meter.					(Specials: Intelligence 4, Tactics 4)Crow Art: Crowfall - A reflexive technique that requires a Stage 2 jutsu usage, but no handseals. Runes appear across the Tachibana-s body before fluffing out a pile of mundane bird feathers. These feathers, imbued with the Tachibana-s chakra, allow the Tachibana to survive any fall. Unconscious Tachibana have been known to perform this technique through muscle memory alone. This technique can work one of two ways - for very long falls, it acts a bit like a parachute. For quicker falls, it-s a soft downy pile that collapses and takes the brunt of the force.Crow Art: Sealing Feather Technique - The Tachibana performs a few quick handseals and provides a Stage 2 usage. They generate what initially appears as a large raven feather - - but it is in fact a sharp bladed projectile with a feathered tail. This feather can be used as a projectile, much like a kunai, but it has an additional benefit - - anything the Feather impacts can be immediately sealed into a Tachibana sealing art that their training otherwise allows them to seal. The projectile is then inscribed with the Tachibana's seal. Regular rules about seal sizes apply, which may render this attack useless.	0	0	0	26	0	0	0	7	7
867	3	3	Space-Time Ninja Techniques	Jinkukan Ninjutsu	Sealing Arts - The Tachibana may now seal a ninjutsu technique equal to two stages less than their highest stage in this list. This requires some special preparation - It requires a series of handseals, a Stage 3 jutsu usage, and a jutsu usage equal to the technique being sealed. The Tachibana-s seal is a size comparable to the stage of technique being sealed. Stage 1 and 2 ninjutsu are small, a single rune encircled. Stage 3 and 4 ninjutsu are larger, typically taking up a full book spread space (both pages of an open book), or an unraveled small scroll. Stage 5 ninjutsu take up the space of a large scroll, or makes up the entire contents of a jar or gourd, or (in a pinch) the caster-s entire body-s worth of tattoo space. A sealed ninjutsu may be released back out later - but this ninjutsu cannot be manipulated any more than the condition it was in at the point of sealing. You can think of this a bit like a portal or reflection of the original jutsu. A sealed Fireball would sprout out and finish any momentum the technique had left before resolving, where as a sealed Chidori is fairly useless if it wasn't sealed on one's own person. Due to the inert nature of Tachibana seals, sealed ninjutsu tend to "fizzle out" inside seals, meaning you cannot trap a jutsu in one thread and then use it in an other thread. You may, however, seal any of your regular ninjutsu, or the ninjutsu of a willing participant, before a thread, to fire off later. The originator of the ninjutsu pays the cost of the jutsu, and the Tachibana pays the cost of the seal, at the moment in time it's revealed in the thread.The Tachibana-s seals are more robust and difficult to break now. The Tachibana themselves may break the seal at no cost, but anyone else must apply a Stage 3 jutsu usage or completely destroy the object the seal is scribed on.(For instance, if the seal is a book, burning the book would release the seal. If it was sealed on the side of a mountain wall, you would only need to destroy the part of the wall the seal is on.)Shunpo - The distance of the Tachibana-s Shunpo is now up to a number of meters equal to -1 of their Taijutsu Speed Scaling, to a minimum of 1 meter.					Sealing Arts - The Tachibana may seal any inert object that they could otherwise lift naturally (with their own body'™s strength, unassisted by other ninjutsu). The Tachibana'™s seals are more robust now, meaning that they take a Stage 1 application of chakra or the seal must be physically destroyed to release. The Tachibana themselves may release the seal at no cost. The Tachibana does not pay a usage for sealing mundane items.Shunpo - The distance of the Tachibana'™s shunpo is now up to a number of meters equal to -2 of their Taijutsu Speed Scaling, with a minimum of 1 meter.	0	0	0	8	0	0	0	10	10
867	4	4	Space-Time Ninja Techniques	Jinkukan Ninjutsu	Sealing Arts - The Tachibana may now seal a genjutsu technique equal to two stages less than their highest stage in this list. This requires some special preparation and training: The Tachibana must also have an equal stage of genjutsu already learned. The Tachibana performs a series of handseals, offers a Stage 4 jutsu usage, as well as a jutsu usage equal to the genjutsu being sealed. This can only be used to seal either the Tachibana-s own genjutsu, or the genjutsu of a willing participant. Due to the complex nature of genjutsu, this can never be used to seal an opponent-s genjutsu. The trigger for the sealed genjutsu changes to The target witnesses this seal breaking. Genjutsu seals may be prepared â€œbefore the thread', so long as all the other conditions are met, and the jutsu usages may be paid when the genjutsu seal is revealed.The Tachibana-s seals, as before, can always be broken for free by the Tachibana. However, now the Tachibana can choose if the breaking the seal releases what is sealed or causes whatever was sealed to be lost, forever, to the Crows. This follows similar rules for destroying objects on Engi - you cannot destroy someone else-s items without their permission. A Stage 4 jutsu usage from anyone can bypass this, as normal.Shunpo - The distance of the Tachibana-s Shunpo is now up to a number of meters equal to the Tachibana-s Taijutsu Speed Scaling.					(Specials: Intelligence 10, Tactics 10, Willpower 8)Crow Art: Commune with the Void - Requires Crow Art: Glimpse of the Void - The Tachibana sets up a stance as they did for Glimpse of the Void, but now they provide a Stage 4 jutsu usage. While speaking to the Birdsong, they may ask for secrets. The Tachibana whispers their question out loud, and the response comes as a harsh whisper audible only to them. They can ask anything the Deep Crow society might know - the location of hidden artifacts, the powers and techniques of powerful individuals, or a collection of rumors. This information tends to be accurate, but can be coloured by the paranoia and anxiety of the society. This technique cannot be used to learn jutsu techniques (other than techniques on this list, for flavor) or to reveal information that is otherwise hidden by a jutsu. While in this state, however, the Tachibana can have a conversation with human-like intelligent shinobi birds from around the world. This communication happens as swiftly as the Tachibana can whisper. This information can be anything that any group of 10 people or more know - they won't be able to tell you the deepest secrets kept. This information was gathered by birds listening into conversations, or witnessing events, and cannot reveal information that was never around birds.If the communion is performed around other living (and/or) intelligent beings, they are beset by the paranoia chatter of the Birdsong, which sounds a bit like religious chanting, desperate speeches, repeated curses, and so on. This chatter penetrates radio signals and the like.Crow Art: Shunshin - As with the typical Shunshin, the Tachibana can immediately appear anywhere within a one mile radius of their current location. Unlike the typical Shunshin, the Tachibana may enter into combat areas with this technique, so long as they appear more than ten feet away from any individual or chakra construct. This teleport technique has a tell. The shinobi performs a single handed sign, and black feathers appear at their feet and rush upwards in a small flurry. The same feathers appear at the point the Tachibana intends to teleport to. If the feathers are disrupted, the technique fails. This requires a Stage 4 jutsu usage which is refunded if the technique is disrupted, but the sudden "bounce back" of the chakra momentarily dazes the shinobi.	0	0	0	14	0	0	14	15	14
867	5	5	Space-Time Ninja Techniques	Jinkukan Ninjutsu	Sealing Arts - The Tachibana is able to seal large, inert spaces. Inert spaces are mundane constructions that do not have active chakra inside of them - an example might be a cottage, a large closed gate, or the like. This sealing attempt fails if anything inside the space does not meet the Tachibana-s sealing requirements. Sealing this massive of an area requires a Stage 5 usage worth of chakra. This technique is paid immediately if the sealing happens 'on screen' in a thread, or is paid when the seal is broken by the Tachibana. Otherwise, as before, the Tachibana does not pay a jutsu usage to break their seal.As a special rule, foodstuff and medicine can now be sealed even if they-re laden with chakra. Foodstuff and medicine sealed this way are perfectly preserved and otherwise treated based on their size in relation to Sealing Arts - a handful of medicine vials would be Stage 1, a large container of food would be Stage 2, and so on. A stage 5 example would be an entire banquet hall or pharmacy.Unsealing such a large space is more complicated than simply breaking a seal - - enough real space must be present for the seal to open. Typically, this is enforced by the seal itself - - reading the sigils will instruct the Tachibana how to set a similar array on the ground. This is a process that can take several minutes to an hour, depending on the space required.Shunpo & Shunshin - The distance of the Tachibana-s Shunpo is now up to a number of meters equal to +1 the Tachibana-s Speed Scaling. If they know Crow Art: Shunshin, they may provide 2 Shunpo usages and a Stage 4 jutsu usage, and may instead Shunshin a distance up to their current Shunpo distance. This Shunshin has a tell, like Crow Art: Shunshin, where the shinobi is covered in feathers at the same time the target location is obscured with feathers. This requires a single handed seal. This limited distance Shunshin technique may be used in combat. If used to dodge an enemy attack, the Tachibana also expends one of their Kawarimi usages for the thread.					(Specials: Intelligence 15, Tactics 15, Willpower 13)Crow Art: Gale Step - After performing a few quick handseals and expending a Stage 5 jutsu usage, the Tachibana effectively becomes light enough to walk on feathers in midair. As long as there's something with as much substance as a crow's feather, the Tachibana can leap off of it or run across it. This technique lasts for one post, and one additional post each time the Tachibana chooses to reflexively add an additional Stage 5 jutsu usage.Crow Art: Vengeful Swap - The Tachibana performs a series of handseals and expends a stage 5 jutsu usage to materialize a ghostly raven. This large bird has the same Taijutsu Speed Scaling as the caster, and can fly around like a normal bird might. This bird is similar to combat bunshin - it can survive light, grazing wounds or "near misses", but any solid strike to center mass, even from a basic and mundane source, will cause it to "pop", forcing whatever that struck the bird to be considered the target. If this bird makes contact with a target the user could otherwise physically move (such as an other human target), the Tachibana may expend a Kawarimi usage to swap places with that target. After a few seconds, the Tachibana and the target swap back. Performing the handseal for Kai will cancel this second swap. This is used to disorient targets, misplace their positioning, cause them to become the target of their own projectiles and ninjutsu, etc. This is a rapid-movement technique and not a teleport, so there must be enough space between the Tachibana and the target for both to swap places.	0	0	0	16	0	0	18	19	19
867	6	6	Space-Time Ninja Techniques	Jinkukan Ninjutsu	Sealing Arts - The Tachibana is now capable of performing legendary feats of curse sealing, such as sealing a bijuu to a human sacrifice (a jinchuuriki). By performing a Stage 6 jutsu usage, the Tachibana may perform any sealing technique that imparts a drastic change on the character sheet of the target (such as becoming a jinchuuriki, receiving a curse seal, and so on.) It goes without saying that you must have the target-s controller-s permission to perform techniques such as these. All seals performed in this way must be seals the character could otherwise elect to have - so effectively this acts mostly as a fluff technique, and does not bypass any restrictions. Bijuu must be 'defeated' and restrained before they can be sealed into a human host (or a cursed weapon, etc, depending on type of jinchuuriki).Tachibana that know the 'Evil Sealing Method' (Stage 6, Global Ninjutsu) may perform these types of feats in combat...but, again, with the target controller's explicit permission.A Tachibana-s seals now may only be broken by the application of a Stage 5 jutsu usage or by careful research (a thread-long endeavor).Shunpo & Shunshin - The distance of the Tachibana-s Shunpo is now up to a number of meters equal to +2 the Tachibana-s Speed Scaling. If they know Crow Art: Shunshin, they may provide 2 Shunpo usages and a Stage 4 jutsu usage, and may instead Shunshin a distance up to their current Shunpo distance. This Shunshin has a tell, like Crow Art: Shunshin, where the shinobi is covered in feathers at the same time the target location is obscured with feathers. This requires a single handed seal. This limited distance Shunshin technique may be used in combat. If used to dodge an enemy attack, the Tachibana also either expends one of their Kawarimi usages for the thread, or they pay a Stage 6 jutsu usage.					(Specials: Intelligence 19, Tactics 19, Willpower 18)Crow Art: Embrace the Void - Requires "Crow Art: Commune with the Void" - The Tachibana sets up a stance as they did for Glimpse of the Void, including still providing a Stage 4 jutsu usage. The Tachibana spends a post in their necromancy stance before being "reverse-summoned" to the domain of the Deep Crows. There, the Tachibana stands before the council of the Deep Crow society - old, rotted, dead gods. Their bodies still contain wisdom beyond wisdom, and by offering a sacrifice, the Deep Crows can provide an "Answer." This "Answer" is a piece of hidden information, or a service. In combat, the "service" can be any one technique (of any stage 6 or below) found from anywhere on the site that does not require a bloodline limit to perform. You may not use an other player's unique swaps without permission, because this technique implies someone has sealed this technique for the Crows previously. If used to unseal a summoning contract, the animal has stats as appropriate for their stage but are a zombified, mummified, or otherwise undead version of a previous summon that filled that slot. Outside of combat, you are intended to "get weird" with it and make this the motivation or setting for a thread, or use it to otherwise propel your character's goals and narrative.The sacrifice becomes an addition, an itch, a whisper in the back of the mind, for something the Deep Crows want. This could be anything - a rare artifact, a sealed technique, a corpse (that may currently still be living), but it should be something you would spend a thread (or a small personal arc) on retrieving. This sacrifice effectively overwrites one's nindo to say, "I must collect the Sacrifice for the Deep Crows". Until the character performs the sacrifice, they cannot call upon the Birdsong again (rendering this technique and the techniques preceding it useless.) The longer the character goes without performing the sacrifice, the more obsessed and paranoid they become. Tachibana who completely ignore their contracted sacrifice tend to end up dead under mysterious circumstances.Crow Art: Rapid Body Flicker - You start to phase in and out of place, rapidly, repeatedly teleporting in place. For the next three posts, you are effectively only tangible when it benefits you and intangible when it penalizes your opponent. ("You're only striking my after-images!") While you're in this state, you're spending about 50 percent of your time in the realm of the Deep Crows, and your chakra system just HATES it. You can't perform anything that requires your chakra system to fire up - meaning no ninjutsu, genjutsu, or taijutsu special techniques. You can brawl and throw projectiles as normal, carry a friend to safety, and so on. After this technique ends, you need a one post cool down before you can start performing jutsu again.	0	0	0	18	0	18	25	25	25
867	7	7	Space-Time Ninja Techniques	Jinkukan Ninjutsu	Sealing Arts - Considered the absolute apex of Sealing techniques, the Tachibana-s seals can only be broken by a thread-long endeavor of research, followed by twice the jutsu usage the Tachibana used to seal it (or two Stage 5 usages if it did not require a jutsu usage). Tachibana, as always, can always release their own seals effortlessly.The Tachibana may now seal willing living targets away. While sealed, the target is able to peer out to the real world from behind the seal, like looking through a dirty window. Their senses are dulled, sounds echo, and they cannot interact with the outside world. By performing the sign for Kai, they can release themselves. While in the seal, time becomes funny - - it becomes difficult to remember how long one has been sealed, and without vigilantly keeping focused on what little of the outside world they can sense, they enter a state of torpor. Living beings sealed this way are completely unaffected by the passage of time. You may also seal away an unwilling target, by providing a Stage 7 jutsu usage. Your fingertips glow with raw chakra energy, and if you can make a contact with all five fingers (ghostly appendages appear to replace any missing ones), you trap the target in the seal. They cannot release themselves with a Kai sign and must instead expend a Stage 7 jutsu usage to break the seal...if they can fight off the torpor. When attacking an unwilling target with this sealing method, the Tachibana has to write the seals mentally with their chakra all across the target's body before they get pulled into the seal. This process takes about a post (for an average sized human) or longer (for very large humans, humans with "weird" conditions such as shinobi implants or bijuu chakra, or large beastial targets). As always, you must have your target's controller's express permission.Shunpo & Shunshin - The distance of the Tachibana-s Shunpo is now up to a number of meters equal to +3 the Tachibana-s Speed Scaling.If they know Crow Art: Shunshin, they may provide 2 Shunpo usages and a Stage 4 jutsu usage, and may instead Shunshin a distance up to their current Shunpo distance. This Shunshin no longer has a tell. This requires a single handed seal. This limited distance Shunshin technique may be used in combat. If used to dodge an enemy attack, the Tachibana also either expends one of their Kawarimi usages for the thread, or they pay a Stage 6 jutsu usage.The Tachibana can create a single totem, which is an item that holds their own personal, unique seal. Typically, this seal includes their entire name as well as ritual runes around it. A decent sized knife, or a book, or a large scroll are examples. You list this totem on your character sheet with the [Tachibana] tag. This totem acts as a two-way teleport. By providing a Stage 4 jutsu usage, you can Shunshin to this totem or have it Shunshin to you. You may perform this feat as many times as you can pay jutsu usages for, and there is no effective range limit.					(Specials: Intelligence 26, Tactics 25, Willpower 24)Crow Art: Limitless Void - Requiring over a hundred handseals and a stage 7 jutsu usage, this technique causes apparent time to rapidly slow down until it very nearly comes to a complete stop. The Tachibana may move around as normal, in a world where time seems to have been sealed. Any living or otherwise intelligent being that the Tachibana comes within 10 feet of "awakens" to the slowed time and experiences the same time stop sensation. This technique lasts indefinitely, until the Tachibana releases the technique or is otherwise incapacitated. People "inside" the technique can interact with each other as normal. People outside the technique only witness a sudden change. Examples of this technique include: fully evacuating a village in a single moment. Having an entire high-stakes ninja fight that no one else can interfere with. Giving oneself the time to deal with emotional trauma before making a big decision. This technique requires the approval of all participants in the thread before it can be activated. (Ideally, either the Tachibana's post will resolve swiftly, or all participants in the thread will be pulled into the time seal.) The saturation of chakra from the Birdsong can affect "frozen" individuals in the thread in unique ways - - they might hear the whisper of the Deep Crows, be beholden to a contract, or simply absorb the chakra, coming out feeling refresh (regaining 1 use of every stage of jutsu they know). As a stage 7 technique, this is intended to be ground-shaking and thread-defining, and could have long lasting effects.Crow Art: Void Art: Emptiness Beyond Compare - This technique requires a Stage 7 jutsu usage, as well as a single handseal that is held for an entire post. The Tachibana taps into the Birdsong, and repeats the whispers they hear on the other side, as glowing runes appear to crawl all over their body. Once their body is completely covered in runes, the Tachibana enters a "sealing state". There are 361 seals that appear on the body, one generated from each chakra point on the body. This sealing state can last for up to three posts, during which the Tachibana may effortlessly (without action economy or jutsu usage considerations) seal anything they know how to seal based on their training with this list. All other rules for sealing apply. As a bonus, they can now seal away all ninjutsu and genjutsu up to Stage 7 by pulling them into their body. After three posts (or the Tachibana is incapacitated), they lose their ability to perform sealing jutsu, summoning jutsu, or rapid-movement jutsu for the rest of the thread.	0	0	0	22	0	22	33	33	33
866	1	1	Keisei Gang Captain	Keisei Kobun	Currency Cost: 10A low level commander isn't really trusted with a lot yet. They may be interesting enough for the family to grace them with some Ototo to help in future jobs, but that doesn't mean they want to sacrifice anyone important to help.The family graces you with one Ototo gangster. They carry a concealable knife (1), and knuckle dusters (2).					Order - Flank Them!Order Type: SoftIntelligence 3, Strength 2With a command or signal, an ally moves into position and then attacks from the target's flank. The attack can be timed to coincide with another attack, and can catch enemies by surprise, or at least put them in a difficult position when they try to find the best way to dodge the attack. For every ally participating in this order, the effective speed taijutsu level of the flankers goes up by 1 (aka, this starts by giving +1. With two allies, both of them get +2, etc). This order lasts from the point it is given, until the ally is attacked or given another order. The ally has +1 speed per stage in this list for the duration of the order.Stage Three: Two allies can be given this order.-Stage Five: Three allies can be given this order.Member - LookoutTactics 3, Speed 2You can replace one member of your gang with a Lookout for any thread. Lookouts keep an eye on what is happening as jobs are going down. They may stay outside and watch for trouble, or they may run ahead and make sure no surprises are going to pop up. Lookouts usually dress light, or wear disguses. They carry a knife (1), and a blowdart launcher with needles (1). The Lookout has +3 speed per stage in this list.They come with the following order:Order - Scout Them OutOrder Type: SoftLookouts are trained to know everything about an enemy from just a few moments of observation. It spells the difference between a gang getting blindsided, and having all the tools to get the job done. With the order, the Lookout will be distracted for the next post, lowering their taijutsu levels by one, because they are keeping an eye on the target. If the target uses a taijutsu attack, the lookout can report what styles they know. If they use a jutsu, the lookout can report back the possible lists (based on the element) and what level (genin/chuunin/jounin/sennin). If the techniques used are weaker than your stage in this list, the lookout will know the exact stage of the technique (explained as a general power level).Order - Follow ThemOrder Type: SoftStrength 3, Willpower 3, LookoutAn ally can be given a special order to follow a target or group. When people flee, an ally will chase after them, going to great lengths to keep within range of the target until they stop or escape. As long as the ally's speed level isn't more than one less than the target, they will continue to keep up until some alternative means are used to confuse or lose them, in which case the ally will communicate this back to the captain. This order lasts until the ally is given a new order, or attacked. They have +3 speed for the duration of the order.Stage Two: +6 speed for the duration of the order-Stage Three: +9 speed for the duration of the orderGift Slot 1Strength 3, Willpower 3Gift Slot 2Tactics 4, Intelligence 4	0	0	2	0	0	2	0	0	0
866	2	2	Keisei Gang Captain	Keisei Kobun	Currency Cost: 10You've done more than nothing now, at least. That means you've at least earned the right to have more than one Ototo with you, or maybe the family just wants an additional person around to keep an eye on you. It doesn't matter, you've earned this chance to prove yourself on the job. It is important that you don't waste it.With this stage, you have two gangsters in your gang. They both have a Knife (1) and knuckle dusters (2).					Order - Guard Us!Order Type: HardStrength 5, Stamina 4, Speed 4Two allies move to the captain's location, gaining +3 stamina for the duration of the order. They keep their backs to the captain and anyone the captain is with, watching for attacks from different directions. If they spot an attack, they will leap in the way, and try to guard their leader, risking harm to themselves. The captain has to keep an eye out as well, giving them constant orders of positioning, and watching for attacks they might miss. As long as the allies have a stamina level higher than the speed level of the attack, they can re-position in time to be in front of the attack, and guard it with whatever means they have. This doesn't help them survive the attack anymore than their stamina and gear would allow. The order lasts until they are given a new order, or break formation with the captain.Stage Three: +6 stamina-Stage Four: +9 staminaMember - BrawlerTactics 6, Intelligence 6, Strength 4You can replace one member of your gang with a Brawler for any thread. Overconfident, strong, and looking to cause trouble, easiest way to describe a brawler. These hand to hand focused gangsters either lack common sense, or see a trail of broken enemies as the only way to impress their Oji. They are intimidating, and ready to start a fight at a moment's notice. The Brawler has +3 strength for every stage you have in this list. They carry knuckle dusters (2), and Limb Armor for their arms (1) and shins (1).They come with the following order:Order - Lay Them OutOrder Type: SoftBrawlers learn real fast how to stun and disable enemies. Whether it is a blow that bangs up their legs, or a punch to the head that leaves them confused, the brawler can lay on the pain. When given the order, they go for one of these wounding punches, hoping to slow down a target for the rest of their gang. The Brawler lays into a target with a devastating combo of punches. If the attack lands, the target has one of their taijutsu levels lowered by one for three posts or until healed. For uncontrolled NPCs, you decide which taijutsu level is lowered, when attacking a PC, they decide which is lowered. For the duration of this order, the Brawler has +1 strength for every stage you have in this list. The order lasts until the Brawler takes a direct hit, or is given another order.Order - Bust It Up!Order Type: HardStrength 6, Stamina 5, Intelligence 5At the captain's orders, any number of allies begin to cause general chaos. Best used in an urban environment, they break windows, knock over appliances, push over bystanders, clang their weapons against poles, whatever is necessary to cause a disruption. This will terrify any bystanders that aren't immediately scared away from the scene. It also causes so much noise that anyone trying to concentrate or communicate will have trouble getting a word in. Outside of urban environments this may just lead to cutting at trees, kicking up dust, or general acts of violence. Bust it up can scare opponents and witnesses, causing a rising dread that makes them too afraid to attack into the chaos and violence. The duration of this is explained below. All allies given the order get +1 strength per stage in this list for the duration, which is two posts, or they are hit with an attack.[The dread and confusion of Bust it Up has a duration like a genjutsu. The duration is 0/2/2, with 'training' based on the taijutsu stage of those around vs the captain's stages in this list. Even if they are unaffected by the dread effect, bust it up causes so much noise that verbal communication with anyone more than 10 feet away is impossible.]Gift Slot 1Strength 6, Stamina 5, Intelligence 5Gift Slot 2Tactics 7, Intelligence 7, Strength 6	0	0	0	4	4	5	0	0	0
866	3	3	Keisei Gang Captain	Keisei Kobun	Currency Cost: 10At this point, you are trusted with Ototo that are likely to be promoted to Ani any day now. They might even start calling you Oji, Uncle, to show that they see you as a leader within the family. Depending on your position within the Keisei, that might be squashed or embraced. Either way, the gangsters are a little more competent now, and aren't liable to get themselves into more trouble than you intend for them. Which is good, because the family expects you to earn your cut.Your two Ototo now carry wakizashi instead of knives, and are competent enough with them that people take them seriously when they brandish them. They aren't some iaijutsu expert, but they have seen enough examples of someone being cut down that they can try a proper cut. Inventory is now Wakizashi (2) and knuckle dusters (2).					Order - Root Them Out!Order Type: HardStrength 8, Stamina 6, Speed 8The captain gives specific orders on any number of allies going into an area to search for hiding targets. Because the captain needs to say what areas to search, who should go, and who to look for, this order can take a little to elaborate on. The allies will dive into whatever area, a swamp, a busy shopping center, a dense fog, and search systematically go through everything looking for their target. They have enough experience looking for people, that any illusion that is a lower stage than your stage in this list, will be rooted out by the allies. Each post, thirty feet of space will be searched per ally given the order. They have +1 speed per stage in this list for the duration of the order, which lasts until they are attacked, or given a new order.Member - BomberTactics 9, Intelligence 9, Strength 7You can replace one member of your gang with a Bomber for any thread. Anarchists, pyromaniacs, or sometimes just skilled explosives experts there to do a specific job, Bombers bring a special skill set to a job. When a wall is going to be in your way, the Bomber can save the day. When you need a really big distraction, or a lot of people hurt, a Bomber can do the trick. They don't have top of the line gear, all of their explosives look like a combination of black market goods and stuff they jammed together themselves, but it will do the trick in a pinch. The Bomber has carries powder bombs (timed explosive tags, 0), explosive pouches (0), smoke bombs (0), and a demolition charge (X).They come with the following order:Order - Crack it Open!Order Type: HardSome obstacles require a little more oomph. A bomber can use an improvised demolition charge to break down large walls, or even defensive ninjutsu. With the order and location given, the bomber runs in and throws the improvised charge, and it will explode at the end of your post. For mundane obstacles, it usually does the trick unless something is just too thick to penetrate. For defensive jutsu, this explosion is equal to strength level eight, and has an aoe of 15 feet. Because the Bomber only has a limited inventory, this can only be used twice per thread per Bomber.Order - Go Incognito.Order Type: SoftStrength 9, Stamina 9, Intelligence 7Any number of allies can pretend they aren't involved with you. Using disguises, staying far away, or whatever other reasonable method of not appearing part of your group. At a word, they burst out of hiding, and show up on the scene. This can be used to bring in allies that weren't previously present in the thread, as long as they can logically arrive. After coming out of hiding, they have +1 speed for every stage you have in this list for the duration of the order, which is until they are attacked, or given another order.Gift Slot 1Strength 9, Stamina 9, Intelligence 7Gift Slot 2Tactics 10, Intelligence 10, Speed 8	0	0	0	8	6	8	0	0	0

They are competent, and have proven themselves within the family already. They aren't as easily shaken, and show grit in battle, making them easier to trust on any particular job. But it doesn't mean you can avoid earning your place as a captain, because Ani are more willing to turn their back on a captain that isn't strong enough to lead them.You have three Ani gangsters now who still carry their wakizashi, but have thought it prudent to add daggers back to their inventory as a backup weapon. It is also possible for them to carry a second dagger instead of a wakizashi, to better conceal their arsenal. Inventory is now Wakizashi (2) and a dagger (1) or Two Daggers (2), Knuckle Dusters (2).					Order - Cover Me!Order Type: SoftStrength 12, Stamina 11, Speed 10, Tactics 12This order allows you to focus on an enemy while there are other distractions on the battlefield. With the order given, any number of allies can be tasked with watching other targets, as long as they aren't the person you designated as who you are fighting. They will go and fight their target, making sure the captain is clear to their chosen rival. If one of those other enemies goes to attack the captain, the ally covering them immediately makes an additional attack with their main weapon. If their target has an equal or lower stamina level, this attack will interrupt and stop any attempt to attack the captain. The allies given the order have +1 stamina for every stage in this list for the duration, which is until they take a direct hit, or are given a different order.Member - MarskmenTactics 14, Intelligence 13, Willpower 11, Stamina 10You can replace one member of your gang with a Marksmen for any thread. The Marksmen prefers to stay away from the main fight, and attack from a distance that allows them to get the perfect shot. They are often confident, stealthier than their allies, and ready to end the fight or flee when it goes south. A Marksmen has +3 stamina and +3 speed for every stage you have in this list. They also carry a Crossbow or Bow (3), a knife (1) and zoom goggles (1).They come with this order:Order - On My Mark.Order Type: SoftThis order requires at least a post for the Marksmen to set up, after a target has been designated by the captain. It also requires for their location to still be unknown to the target. The marksmen will fire when the signal is given, using the best angle they have. Because the sniper is prepared beforehand, and ready for an exact mark and target, this shot can seem to come out of nowhere, and strike with amazing coordination with other attacks. The signal is made, there is a short delay for the projectile to travel, and that is all the warning that is given. The Marksmen has +1 speed for every stage in this list for the duration of the order, which is until they are attacked, or are given another order.Advancement - PyroechnicsStrength 14, Stamina 13, Speed 11, Intelligence 10, BomberJust having a bomber available to your gang makes your other members a little more crafty when the situation calls for it.

The question of loyalty may come up often now. You are a strong captain, and whether the gang you lead belongs to the Keisei, or just uses Keisei Ani, is a question no one wants to bring up because of the violence that may come with the answer. But your boys are yours, and they will fight for you if you give the order.You now have three Ani. They each carry wakizashi, limb armor, knives and dusters. They are usually seasoned, and some may have been with you for a few jobs now if you haven't gotten too many people killed along the way. Inventory is now Wakizashi (2) or Twin Daggers (2) , Limb armor (1), Dusters (2).					Order - Pile On!Order Type: HardStrength 17, Stamina 16, Speed 16, Tactics 15All available allies surround the captain's target, and close in. They will corner and trap the target, or targets if the targets are bunched up. The gangsters will do whatever efforts necessary to keep the targets physically closed in before they can get in for their attack, even leaping into the air to intercept. The pile on itself ends up being a dog pile on the target, punching them unconscious with their dusters. Physically leaving the circle is difficult if the target's speed level is lower than the strength level of the weakest ally given the Pile On order. Allies get +1 strength per stage in this list for the duration of the order, and the order lasts until they take a direct hit or receive a new order.Member - WannabeeTactics 18, Intelligence 17, Willpower 17, Stamina 14One member of your gang can be replaced with a Wannabee for any thread. Sometimes a gangster gets it in their head that they are something more, a gallant samurai ready to strike down their enemies with a swing of their blade. The Wannabee isn't a samurai. Maybe they started training to be one, they just swing a blade well, or they have the determination. But they just aren't the full deal. That said, they take a hit well, and fight like a soldier in the thick of war. The Wannabee carries a Katana (3), a Wakizashi (2), and Chest Armor (2). They have +3 Strength and +3 Stamina for every stage in this list.The Wannabee can use normal techniques from any universal sword style as if they knew stage three of the list and the technique doesn't require chakra.Advancement - Ranged Warfare.Strength 18, Stamina 17, Speed 17, Intelligence 14, MarksmenNot every fight requires going toe to toe with the foe, and not every enemy wants to stay still and let you chase them down.

They will stick with you through dangers, and they are ready to cut down any enemies that stand between you and your goals. They are more than just gangsters, they are allies.You now have four Ani who carry Katana (3) or Bats (3), as well as twin daggers (2), Limb Armor (1), and Dusters (2).					Advancement - ArmamentsStrength 21, Stamina 20, Speed 19, Tactics 17, Intelligence 15Most members of the Family will provide their own weapons, and are rather proud of them. But what they carry is definitely shaped by how much they are taking home from jobs, or what their Oji is willing to help them with. With this advancement, your gangsters will carry better weapons to their jobs, based on what they already carry. Knives and Daggers (1) are upgraded to Wakizashi (2). Wakizashi and Axes (2) are upgraded to Katana or Jian (3). Katana (3) are upgraded to Bastard swords or cleavers (4). If it would be a bad idea to carry around the more advanced weapon, this is optional.Member - OjiTacitcs 23, Intelligence 23, Willpower 22, Stamina 16, Speed 15You may replace one member of your gang with an Oji for any thread. It can be hard to keep a gang running, especially if you also plan to act on the battlefield. Having another Oji around relieves a lot of the stress, since you can just give a simple order, and then they can elaborate on the details or drive the men to action. An Oji is experienced, and deserves respect on the field, so sometimes they don't stick around if the fight is clearly going South. While an Oji is on the field, any Hard order you give is instead Soft, if the Oji can relay it to everyone else. An Oji's inventory is the same as an unmodified Oji/Ani for your stage. The Oji has +3 stamina for every stage you have in this list.They come with the following order:Order - Call in a FavorOrder Type: HardOji typically run their own gangs, so it is no surprise that they can organize and manage the members of a gang with a level of expertise that evades even someone learning to be a gang captain. This order shows the level of preparation Oji have in the field. With a call on a communication device, or a pre-set signal, the Oji calls in another gang member that was not previously in the thread. This could just be a basic Ani, or it could be a replacement Member. The call in character may enter the thread and be given an order in the same post, giving them an element of surprise. The limit to this ability is that it does not allow you to go over your maximum number of gang members, so another must have already been defeated, fled, or otherwise not be able to participate. The extra gang member could also find a reason to leave within that same post. This order can only be used once per thread.Order - Chemical WarfareOrder Type: HardStrength 23, Stamina 23, Speed 22, Intelligence 16, Willpower 15, BomberThis order requires a Doc or a Bomber. With some work together, Docs and Bombers can work together to create a dangerous weapon that can terrorize a battlefield. The weapon looks like a fragile ball of swirling liquid, a combination of a poison and the triggering explosive devices to propel it into the air. It can be thrown up to 40 feet, and explodes on impact, letting out a 40 foot cloud of thick gas. Not only does the gas block eyesight like a thin smoke, but anyone who inhales the gas will find it difficult to breath, causing terrible coughing fits that steal the breath and can leave victims passed out on the floor. The lack of breath doesn't stop just because the target passes out, they will suffocate as the chemicals in the cloud swell their throat closed. It takes one post for coughing to begin, two posts of contact will swell the throat and limit breathing to slow wheezing (taijutsu levels are lowered by two), and by four posts anyone still in the cloud will no longer be able to breath. Once out of the cloud, symptoms continue for two posts before clearing up. This can only be used once per thread. A simple breathing mask or filter can block the terrible effect on the throat and lungs. The cloud lingers for five posts.Gift Slot 1Strength 23, Stamina 23,Speed 22, Intelligence 16, Willpower 15Gift Slot 2Tactics 26, Intelligence 25, Willpower 24, Strength 19, Stamina17Gifts from the FamilyThese special techniques are only available by spending saved up Keisei Currency.

865	1	1	Obama Genjutsu	Kanzen	The first stage of Kanzen creates a small Kanpeki, an illusion no larger than the Obama clan member. Even common members of the clan have been known to use this technique, taking on a feral pose to represent strange beasts like two-headed wolves and dire bears. The user goes through a special set of seals, and pours chakra into the charms and marks of their suit. From that point on, anyone who sees or hears them, will see the Kanpeki beast. Kanzen is purely visual at this stage, which means that the sounds of the beast come from the user. It also means that those with keen senses of smell may notice that the Kanpeki just smells like a human being.The Obama's technique is simple at this stage, their movements mirror the movements of the beast. The illusion is strained when the Obama gets confused or distracted, as the beast will seem to stand idle.The illusion stays intact as long as the Obama makes the proper seals every post. Anyone who uses kai can immediately dismiss the illusion, which is dangerous for the Obama's secret.				Emergence of the BeastTrigger: Being seen by the targetWithout emergence, the arrival of a Kanpeki has to be manually masked by the Obama. Methods range from throwing smoke bombs, to simply arriving in your opponent's blindspot. Emergence is a genjutsu that represents a disruptive arrival for the beast the Obama has created. This could be the Kanpeki crashing through a wall, morphing out of the Obama's body, or landing from above. The arrival is short, loud, and only serves to begin the extended illusion of Kanzen.After one post, everything about the arrival that was created by illusion will fade away, the pieces of discarded wall vanish or the dust cloud from the landing fades away.Duration 1/1/1Reeking OdorTrigger: Seeing the Kanpeki, and currently influenced by KanzenWhile Kanzen doesn't cover the smell of the beast at lower levels, this technique can be used to cover for that weakness, or create new opportunities. This genjutsu can create a terrible odor in the mind of anyone currently effected by the Kanzen illusion, and able to see the Kanpeki. This smell can be powerful enough to cause mild nausea, but typically it will just end with the target covering their nose and wishing to get away from the source.Duration: 1/3/6		0	0	0	4	0	4	0	0	0
865	2	2	Obama Genjutsu	Kanzen	The next level of Kanzen makes the Kanpeki as large as a young adult elephant, so some Obama can stand at the center of their own illusion. The beast gains an auditory illusion, so it can growl and snarl like the beast it represents. There is still no corresponding smell.The Obama's movements within the illusion are now coordinated. Their stance within the illusion is like an odd march, or interpretive dance, each movement representing a command for the illusion their enemy will see. The Obama may be afraid, but the beast can snarl in defiance.The Obama must make seals every post. Kai will destroy the illusion.				Oasis HazeTrigger: Able to see the KanpekiThe Leviathans are the beasts of the oasis, known for stalking prey on the open dunes of Wind country. Oasis Haze is a visual trick that distorts the distance between the Kanpeki and their target. Unless the target is in melee range, the Kanpeki appears clouded, as if the heat of the desert is twisting the air, giving them the wavy appearance of an illusion. This benefits the Obama by raising the chance their victim will miss ranged attacks, and also helps justify to victims when attacks miss because they go right through the Kanpeki illusion.Duration: 1/3/5Doppler BarkTrigger: Able to hear the Kanpeki's 'special roar'The Obama hound the enemies of Sand when they find them, tracking them in the many different environments across Wind. The Doppler Bark is an illusionary roar created by the Obama bursting an explosive pouch near their targets. Those who hear the pop, are caught in the illusion. The Doppler Bark echoes, sounding as if it is bouncing around the area, and coming from different directions, which can be disorienting.Doppler Bark also counts as a trigger for Kanzen, anyone under this genjutsu will continue to see the Kanpeki for the duration, even if the Obama does not make new seals.Duration: 1/2/4		0	0	0	7	0	7	0	6	0
865	3	3	Obama Genjutsu	Kanzen	The Kanpeki is now the size of an adult elephant. With this increase in size, the Obama realizes that they can locate themselves anywhere within the illusion. This allows the beast to be attacked, and take 'damage', without the Obama needing to be hit by the blow. Kanzen still does not produce a smell.The Kanpeki is now large enough that the illusion must extend to damage it causes to the area. It can leave temporary impressions in the ground from stomping, or slashes against walls.The illusion is now powerful enough that someone needs stage four or higher genjutsu for their Kai to pierce the illusion. The illusion lasts for one post before the Obama must reestablish their handseals.				Gaze of DominanceTrigger: Looking into the eyes of the KanpekiMeeting the gaze of the Leviathan can create a sensation of being dominated by a larger animal. Dominance causes targets to avoid looking directly at the Kanpeki, forcing their eyes down or away even if they are trying to fight the creature head on. The Kanpeki's eyes glow and spiral on the periphery, seeming overwhelming in the target's mind.Duration: 1/1/2Quaking FootfallsTrigger: Feeling the impact of the Kanpeki's 'stomp'Using a special concussive pouch, the Obama can create the illusion that their Kanpeki is causing tremors from stomping at the ground. If the target is caught in the illusion, the small push from the pouch's pop is enough to make the target feel off balance, maybe even toppling them off their feet, as the Kanpeki continues to stomp and rampage.While Quaking continues, it counts as a trigger for Kanzen, continuing the Kanpeki illusion even if the Obama doesn't create their seals.Duration: 1/2/2		0	0	0	10	0	10	0	8	0
865	4	4	Obama Genjutsu	Kanzen	This stage completes a lot of the illusion of the Kanpeki. Now the beast gives off its own appropriate odor, masking it even against those with the senses to poke holes in the illusion. The coordinated movements of the Obama can now create complicated motions from the beast. It gains a sense of intelligence, being able to reflect an emotional range that isn't typically expected.Stage Five genjutsu is required to be able to kai out of Kanzen. The illusion will remain for one post before the Obama must reestablish their seals.				Mesmerizing MonsterTrigger: Looking directly at the KanpekiThere is no creature greater than the Leviathan, and its victims are in awe just looking at it. This genjutsu creates a sense of awe, making the Kanpeki larger than life in the eyes of those looking at it. While they can focus on objects elsewhere, they know all too well that the Kanpeki is at the edge of their vision, or right behind them. While Mesmerizing Monster lasts, there is no greater threat in the target's mind than the Kanpeki. This tends to draw extra fire toward the Kanpeki, but a leviathan is prepared for consequences.While Mesmerizing Monster continues, it counts as a trigger for Kanzen, continuing the Kanpeki illusion even if the Obama doesn't create their seals.Duration: 1/2/4Dire maulingTrigger: Being hit by an attack from the ObamaA Leviathan doesn't leave a simple scratch. Even the smallest blow can cut open massive gashes, or crush bones. This illusion is meant to shock a target that has been hit by an attack, suddenly increasing the scale of a wound they have taken to make it appear crippling or mortal. The pain feels real, the nick on the arm becomes a bone exposing slash, and the terrible waves of pain follow immediately after. They will realize they were mistaken as the genjutsu fades.Duration: 1/2/2		0	0	0	15	14	14	0	14	0
865	5	5	Obama Genjutsu	Kanzen	The Kanpeki is now even larger, being up to 20 feet tall and just as wide. The illusion reflects the drastic size, with the beast shifting the world around it. More important than the increase in size, is the new level of control from the Obama. Their movements allow them to make the Kanpeki seem more agile than expected, or adjust the size of the illusion briefly to stretch for attacks or shrink away from blows.The illusion can now be shattered by a Kai from someone with stage six or higher genjutsu. The illusion remains for one post before the Obama must reestablish their handseals.				Unkillable BeastTrigger: Seeing an attack on the KanpekiThe benefit of being a small person inside of a large illusion is that victims of Kanzen can be lead to believe their attacks did no noticeable damage. Unkillable Monster goes further, planting the depressing thought that weaker attacks are of no use at all. To defeat a leviathan, only the most powerful attacks will work, and everything else would be a waste. To the victim, any attack stage four or under will seem to fizzle or be deflected on impact with the Kanpeki. This even works against taijutsu.Duration: 0/2/4Ownership of the AlphaTrigger: The target looks at a woundThe Leviathan is the leader in any attack, and it has first pick of everything. That includes first pick of damage caused. Ownership makes a target believe that whatever wound they are looking at, was actually caused by the Kanpeki. A knife cut becomes a claw slash, a bruise from a punch looks like the impact from a beast's pounce. The size or scale of damage doesn't change, but the victim is sure that they were hurt by the Kanpeki instead of whatever actually attacked them.Duration: 0/3/5Devastating RoarTrigger: Hearing the Kanpeki's special 'roar'By throwing a special sphere that lets out a whistle, the Obama can create the illusion that the Kanpeki is building up a devastating attack. The roar it unleashes is like a localized whirlwind, slices of wind ripping at the target and threatening to blow them off of the ground. Trying to stand without bracing yourself or hiding behind cover would be impossible, and light objects are picked up and carried away! This gives victims the fear that they must move to cover, plant themselves in place, or leave completely.Duration: 1/1/1		0	0	0	19	18	19	0	16	0
865	6	6	Obama Genjutsu	Kanzen	The Kanpeki's size increases to 30 feet. On top of that, the Obama can now make the Kanpeki speak, instead of the growling and snarling of before. This allows the beast to become a true villain of legend, able to taunt foes in battle.The basic illusion of the Kanpeki is alarming now, giving off a sense of power that unnerves weaker opponents. It bristles with energy, giving off a pressure that gives a natural urge toward fight or flight.The illusion can no longer be outright broken by kai, but stage six or greater kai can reduce the number of posts the illusion influences the victim. The illusion remains for two posts before the Obama must reestablish their seals.				DestructionTrigger: Seeing a special flashDestruction warps the surrounding environment with one attack. The Kanpeki unleashes on a 60 foot area around it, whether that means blowing flames or just ripping everything apart with its limbs, the victims of the illusion see the local area as torn up by the Kanpeki. Those who see the flash of the Obama's special throwing pouch will feel intense pressure, unease, and dread, as they view the beast tearing everything up around it. This makes anyone outside of the zone, unwilling to risk going inside unless they absolutely must. If they do, they themselves are damaged by the Kanpeki's tantrum.This illusion ending tends to strain Kanzen, as a wide area reverts back to normal.But during the duration, this acts as a trigger for Kanzen, and the Kanpeki illusion remains without the Obama needing to make handseals.Duration: 0/2/4SwellingTrigger: Looking at the KanpekiThe enemy wants to fight a giant, they know they are fighting a giant, so the Obama gives them a giant. The Kanpeki grows to twice its normal size, towering over small buildings and filling the air with its roars. Swelling increases how the target sees the strength of the Kanpeki too, with its footfalls leaving dents in the earth, and its breath shaking trees. This increase in size can be used to the Obama's advantage, as most attacks will now simply miss the Obama inside the illusion.Duration: 0/2/3		0	0	0	26	24	25	0	20	16
865	7	7	Obama Genjutsu	Kanzen	The Kanpeki has reached its full height, appearing 35 feet in size. It now glimmers with power, and is impossible not to notice. These are the Kanpeki that are remembered for forever, their very appearance leaves an impression, and gives enemies pause.The Obama has expert control over the creature, able to mold its form on the fly, to the point of even changing major visual aspects of the creature mid-battle, like color and sounds, if the situation calls for it. The world respects the Kanpeki illusion, with the environment destroyed by its every move.Kai no longer influences the Kanpeki illusion. The illusion remains for three posts before the Obama must reestablish their seals.				Legend-makingTrigger: In Kanzen for more than three postsLegend-making warps the memories of a target. They no longer just remember fighting a monster, they have fought a myth. The Kanpeki is a creature of legend to them, something they have always remembered, and something they always will remember. They see it in their dreams, they see it in the clouds, they remember it from childhood stories. In a way, this illusion makes the target obsessed with the Kanpeki, and some of the Leviathan of the past got their names from the ramblings of those who fell victim to this attack.After legend making has been used on someone, they will always see the battle suit of the Obama as the Kanpeki, no seals required. This is different from the Kanzen illusion, and the beast will not move with intelligence unless Kanzen is being used. This is more a madness, a latent trigger in their head that places the image of the Kanpeki over the battle suit's location.Leviathan's OppressionTrigger: Being hit by a special projectileThis attack requires the Obama to project a large amount of energy into a ceremonial knife. This weapon, as well as the charms and marks on the Obama's suit, glows with the energy being transferred into it. After that, the knife can be thrown, or just used as a weapon. If the target is hit by this special knife, then Oppression is triggered (the knife is now a normal weapon).While under Oppression, the Obama can imagine any attack for their Kanpeki to make, and these attacks don't miss. The Kanpeki could breath fire, grow cleaver-sized claws, or attempt to swallow the target all at once, and no matter how much they evade, they feel they have been caught, and suffer the pain and consequences.Duration: 1/2/3		0	0	0	34	31	34	0	24	20
864	1	1	Trick of Water	Mizu no Waruasobi	Description:. A small drop of water is flicked from the fingers. This drop can be heated or chilled. If it hits a target's eye, it blurs their vision for one post. Otherwise the drop will only cause a brief flare-up of pain when it hits, similar to being slapped. One additional 'flick' of water can be launched for every Stage known in this list. This technique has a range of 10 feet.														
864	1	2	Water Mirror Technique	Mizu Kagami no Jutsu	A seal is drawn using water onto a stationary surface, then drawn again usually on a small handheld mirror or other reflective surface. For three posts the two surfaces are linked, with the second seal acting as a 'monitor' from which the user may observe what is being reflected by the first seal. This technique does not transfer audio and only shows what would be seen from the position of the first seal. The two seals cannot be more than 50 feet apart and can be destroyed by any mundane means. If the first seal is moved at all the technique immediately ends. Stage Three: The reflected sight may be augmented with night-vision or thermal vision, but not both. Stage Five: The reflected sight may last indefinitely and have up to a mile range.														
864	1	3	Fish Spit	Uo Tsuba	A thin jet of water shot from the mouth which hits with the same force as a thrown projectile that travels for 15 feet. If desired rather than striking with physical force, the jet can expand into a heated puff of steam upon impact. The steam makes a smoke-bomb's worth of vision obscuring, stinging vapor that fades away in the same post. Academy students often play a game much like tag using this technique. Base Effect: 1 jet Stage 2: 2 jets, or 1 ricocheting jet with twice the range Stage 3: 4 jets, or 1 ricocheting jet with four times the range Stage 4: 6 jets, or 1 ricocheting jet with six times the range.														
864	1	4	Water Clone Technique	Mizu Bunshin no Jutsu	A dripping wet clone of the user is formed from a small source of water. Water clones have 1/10 the stats of the user including taijutsu bonuses. If the water clones has the required stats, it may perform one water jutsu before poofing into steam. Water clones may also melt into puddles to slip through small gaps or disguise themselves. One solid hit will destroy the clone. Base Effect: 1 clone Stage Two: 2 clones Stage Three: 4 clones Stage Four: 6 clones														
864	1	5	Water Glove Technique	Mizu Tebukuro no Jutsu	A coat of warm water covers the user's hands. These water gloves possess the defensive capabilities of leather and heat what they touch. This heat is painful but not damaging, like putting one's hand on a hot beverage for too long. Lasts 2 posts. Base Effect: Leather durability, water extends only to wrists. Stage Three: Protects against Stage Two jutsu or Level 2 strength, extends to shoulders. Stage Five: Protects against Stage Four jutsu or Level 4 strength, covers arms and upper torso.														
864	1	6	Open Slot																
864	2	1	Water Pellet	Mizu Peretto	Several dozen bubbles are released from the mouth, each the size of a marble. When these bubbles touch a surface they pop, causing a small paper cut sized wound on the surface that burst them. The bubbles cannot be aimed or controlled once released and spread like a cloud, though the bubbles will never pop from touching the user. Bubbles remain in the air at least 2 posts before popping automatically. Stage Three: In addition to cutting, bubbles can pop into steam, causing blistering burns. Stage Four: Bubbles become translucent and hard to see, as if possessing the Obscured modifier. Stage Five: Bubbles can be manually controlled for up to 30 feet for their whole duration, moving at level 3 Speed.														
864	2	2	Water Puddle Technique	Mizutamari no Jutsu	The user melts into a goo-like puddle of water roughly the same size as their body. From the outside the puddle looks just like water. While in this form the user can only see what images are reflected in the puddle's surface. If someone steps into the puddle, the user may suddenly 'boil' up to life, splashing hot water and causing small burns. If the puddle is attacked the user reverts back to normal and takes the full damage of the attack. The puddle may move at Level 1 Speed on dry land, or at normal Speed levels in larger bodies of water. This technique cannot be used to travel through any gaps the user normally couldn't squeeze though. Lasts 2 posts. This can be used to avoid an attack, but consumes a kawarimi usage when used in this way. Stage Three: 4 post duration Stage Four: The user melts into a much smaller puddle, enough to fill a teacup.														
864	2	3	Water Element: Water Shuriken Technique	Suiton: Mizu Shuriken no Jutsu	Multiple small projectiles are created from any water source in eyesight of the user. These projectiles launch themselves towards one or multiple targets. Upon collision, these projectiles revert to water. Any projectile in a shinobi kit may be created and launched. A number of projectiles equal to twice the number of Stage known in this list may be formed per usage. Base Effect: 0 point projectiles may be formed and launched Stage Three: 1 point projectiles may be formed and launched Stage Four: Three projectiles can be launched per Stage known in this list. Stage Five: Five projectiles can be launched per Stage known in this list.														
864	2	4	Beach Crab	Isonagi no Jutsu	This technique creates a large crab out of any wet surface in eyesight. The water crab possesses Level One in all physical stats and can range in size from normal crab size to human sized. Soil or sand is loosened around the crab, turning it swampy and quicksand-like in a ten foot radius. The crab will stay in this area and attempt to grab and pull targets into the quicksand. The crab lasts for 3 posts or until it sustains one attack. Stage Three Paper Crab Seals may be created, which only activate their effects when a target walks into their radius. Stage Four The Forbidden Crab Seal may be placed on the user or a consenting individual, letting them hide in any surface their crab normally could for 3 posts.														
864	2	5	Water Shield Technique	Mizu Tate no Jutsu	Water is collected and formed into a stationary cylindrical tube surrounding the user in a 5 foot radius. This water can be manipulated freely into spikes, tentacles, claws, or other limbs, so long as user remains inside the cylinder. One set of extra appendages can be formed per Stage known in this list. The cylinder is stationary and lasts for 3 posts and heats up more and more with each post, before finally boiling away into steam on the last one. The cylinder will completely evaporate against any ninjutsu. Blocks up to Level 2 physical attacks. Stage Three: Can block up to Level 4 physical attacks Stage Four: Can block up to Level 6 physical attacks Stage Five: Can block up to Level 8 physical attacks														
864	2	6	Lobster Pot Technique	Kagoryou no Jutsu	Any stationary water in sight can be heated to a boiling temperature, for 1 post. The amount of water that can be boiled this way is equal to 1 large gourd per Stage known in this list. If the user has skin-to-skin contact with another person, they may heat the water inside that person instead. This does not cause it to boil but will cause the person to feel immensely hot, causing sweating, light-headedness, and disorientation for as long as physical contact is maintained. This effect lingers for 1 post after contact is severed. Notably used during Kirigakure festivals to instantly cook shrimp and other crustaceans.														
864	3	1	Water Sword	Mizu no Yaiba	Creates a weapon with no modifiers costing no more than 3 points out of water. The weapon is translucent and possesses the Obscured modifier. The weapon can be used for a single basic attack or defense before falling apart, but can be reformed without needing hand seals in the next post if another usage is consumed. Stage Four: Existing items may be coated with water, granting them the Obscured and Repair modifier for the rest of the thread. Stage Five: Weapon may cost up to 4 points, with modifiers.														
864	3	2	Blunt Sniper Technique	Namakura Sogekihei no Jutsu	The user forms then fires a volleyball-sized ball of hot water at a target, from a distance of up to 100 feet. It flies and strikes with a Physical Level equal to the number of Stages known in this list. If something is struck with this technique, it will emit an easy to track trail of steam high into the air for 4 posts.														
864	3	3	Water Reflection Clone Technique	Mizukaisou Bunshin no Jutsu	A body of water is first transformed into a mirror. As soon as the mirror reflects another person, it transforms into a clone of that reflection. The clone possesses Chakra, Mental, and Physical stats equivalent to 1/3 the user's (not the reflections) stats, rounded up and including taijutsu bonuses. The Water Reflection Clone will sound and act likes the reflection unless the user commands otherwise. In addition the Water Reflection Clone possesses a small genjutsu component, allowing it to speak to the insecurities of the one it copies (up to the target to decide if this happens or not). All clones are destroyed by one solid hit. Stage Four: If the first reflection is destroyed, another will emerge from the mirror until the mirror is destroyed. Stage Five: If the mirror is destroyed, a clone with half of the stats (rounded up) of the destroyer appears.														
864	3	4	Water Armor	Mizu no Yoroi	A thin layer of water covers the user's whole body. This passively lets the user breathe underwater while active, but does not filter air otherwise. When the user is struck by a physical blow the armor rapidly boils into steam, spraying hot water in the direction of the attack and lessening (though not negating) its force by 1 Level, to a minimum of 1. The entire armor may be offensively evaporated in a single post, causing an explosive burst of steam to travel outwards for 10 feet in all directions. Those struck by this cloud will lose one Strength Level for that post. Lasts 3 posts or for one attack, whichever comes first. Stage Four:: Lower physical attacks by 2 levels. Stage Five: Can sustain 2 attacks before evaporating.														
864	3	5	River Devils	Kasui no Akki	Descriptions: Tiny aquatic constructs are created on any visible wet surface, usually in the shape of fish but possibly in the shape of any marine animal no larger than a rat. These constructs can travel through any connected wet surfaces or water sources no matter how shallow. River Devils have Level 4 in all physical stats, but only when in water or attacking from it. On dry land they flap around uselessly before evaporating away. River Devils are boiling hot to the touch and emit a slight cloud of steam before they attack. They can bite or claw with kunai sharpness, or detonate into a spray of boiling hot water with a radius of 5 feet. River Devils last for 3 posts, or until they sustain one attack. Base Effect: 3 Devils are created. Stage 4 Effect: 5 Devils are created. Stage 5 Effect: 7 Devils are created.														
864	3	6	Open Slot																
864	4	1	Water Ball	Mizu Tama	The user spits out a large ball of water that flies and hits with a physical Levels up to or equal to the highest Stage known in this list, over a distance of 100 feet. The water ball is the size of a watermelon and leaves behind a trail of water in its wake. A target struck by the ball is immediately surrounded by a restrictive bubble which prevents movement, but not actions. The bubble requires Stage Three or lower ninjutsu to break out of (or into), or Level 5 or above Strength. The bubble lasts for 2 posts. Stage Five: Two bubbles may be formed and fired, without stacking effects if the target is hit by both. Stage Six: Friendly targets can use the bubble to move at the user's Speed Levels.														
864	4	2	Water Transportation	Mizu Shunshin	Only usable while standing on a puddle. In a poof of vapor, the user may travel in between any two bodies of water larger than a puddle that are separated by no more than a mile. This can be used outside of combat as a means of transportation for up to 4 additional people or targets, but inside combat it can only be used to escape or to exit the thread by themselves. If the user owns a ship, this may be used to transport themselves to their vessel regardless of the distance.														
864	4	3	Water Chains Technique	Suikusari no Jutsu	Twisted, coiled tendrils of water burst out of any wet surface in sight, stretching out for 15 feet. These tentacles attempt to wrap around and restrain a single target. The chains bind or strike with a Strength Level equal to twice the maximum known in this list. Lasts 2 posts.														
864	4	4	Pressure Hose Technique	Assaku Hosu no Jutsu	A blast of hot water is fired from the hands. The blast is one foot in diameter with a range of 50 feet and will blister the skin of those it makes contact with. The pressure hose hits with Level 4 Strength, plus 1 additional Level of Strength for each extra usage consumed when the technique is used. Stage 5: Stage Five usages may be consumed to increase the Strength Level by 1 per usage.														
864	4	5	Hidden Mist Technique	Kirigakure no Jutsu	A thick mist materializes, covering a 200 feet radius centered on the user. The mist swirls about, obscuring vision and distorting sound. Visibility is cut down to three feet. This is a non-natural mist which obstructs view against vision-enhancing jutsu Stage Three and below. The mist may be heated to steam levels, reducing its duration by one post and causing those who breathe it in apart from the user throat and lung pain. The user of this technique can sense all movement within the mist, but only the relative speed and size of what is moving. Base Effect: 3 posts Stage 5: 4 posts Stage 6: 5 posts														
864	4	6	Open Slot																
864	5	1	Water Element: Water Cannon Technique	Suiton: Suihou no Jutsu	The infamous Kirigakure Naval Chakra Cannon technique was used to brutal effect during the Seagull War. Alone, this is technique only emits a highly pressurized ball of water that explodes on impact with the force of an explosive tag, with an effective range of up to 250 feet. On official Navy ships equipped with Naval Chakra Cannons, the range and explosive power increase by an order of 10, allowing for incredibly devastating artillery bombardments. Power 24: Given a post and a box of scraps, the user may construct or repair a stationary Naval Chakra Cannon. Power 31: By consuming all their Stage Two and above usages, the user may fire this jutsu as if it were from a Naval Chakra Cannon. Control 24: Three shots may be fired per usage, in the same or separate posts. Control 32: Five shots may be fired per usage, in the same or separate posts.														
864	5	2	Mist Vision Technique	Kiri Shikaku no Jutsu	A technique usually used with Kirigakure no Jutsu, the Mist Vision technique allows the user to see from any water or mist or they themselves have conjured in the thread that lays within a 50 foot radius. This vision is additive, meaning the user retains their own vision in addition to the vision provided by their water, but only sees what the user's eyes would have in that same location. Genjutsu triggers are still transmitted through the sight provided by this technique. Consumes a usage per post.														
864	5	3	Drilling Water Spears	Doiru Suiyari no Jutsu	Several spear-length and foot thick drills spiral out from any water in sight. These drills can target separate opponents or be used for defense. It takes 3 drills to nullify up to Stage 4 ninjutsu. 3 drills are created per usage. Power 25: 5 drills are formed Power 32: 8 drills are formed Control 25: All drills may be used to block Stage 5 jutsu Control 33: All drills may be used to block Stage 6 jutsu														
864	5	4	Water Element: Water Torrent Technique	Suiton: Suise no Jutsu	Two seals are placed or drawn in different locations no more than 150 feet apart. With a single hand seal the user releases a massive torrent of water from one seal, which will flood downwards with Level Four physical force until it reaches the second seal. The second seal acts as a drain, sucking up the torrent of water. Everything in between the paths of the seals will be slammed with the wave. Essentially generates raging river rapids between the two seals, which can be a maximum of 30 feet wide and a maximum of 150 feet long. Lasts for 3 posts, and can be used as a source of water for ninjutsu during that time. Intelligence 25: A small, shorter torrent can be formed (10 feet by 50 feet), but of boiling water instead. Intelligence 32: By consuming 3 usages instead of 1, the duration may be extended indefinitely until the user wills it to stop.														
864	5	5	Geyser Technique	Kanketsusen no Jutsu	At any point that the user wishes within a 50 foot radius, an eruption of steam and boiling water burst from the ground. The geyser fires 30 feet into the air in a 5 foot radius of its emergence point. Afterwards a steaming hot rain will fall on everything in a 25 foot radius from the geyser, where each drop can cause blistering burns and boils. Lasts a single post. 26 Power: Two geysers may be formed at the same time in different locations. 33 Power: By consuming 3 usages instead of 1, all geysers may last 3 posts.														
864	5	6	Blessing of the Sacred Fountain	Seinaru Funsen no Megumi	Mist's medical division developed this jutsu to continually cleanse biological systems and purify foreign agents. A small gourd's worth of glowing golden liquid is created. The entire quantity must be consumed to be effective. Once the liquid is consumed a 3 post 'timer' starts. At the end of the 3 posts the drinker's body will regenerate back to the physical state it was at the moment the timer began (IE, the state of the body 3 posts prior). This does not affect genjutsu, mental states (memories), or chakra (usages, durations, stat penalties, etc). This doesn't work if the drinker dies before the blessing can work its magic. Only usable once per thread per person. Intelligence 23: The duration can be between 2 and 4 posts, but must be set when consumed. Intelligence 30: Only a small sip from the gourd is necessary for the blessing to work, allowing it to be shared between up to 4 people.														
864	6	1	Steam Technique	Suijouki no Jutsu	A mass of billowing steam in exhaled in a cone from the mouth. At close range steam is superheated and can boil skin right off the bone. After 10 feet the temperature and pressure drop off to be hot enough to only cause second degree burns. The cone is 45 degrees and extends out 50 feet Power 28 : 20 foot superheated radius Power 35: 30 foot superheated radius Control 27 90 degree cone Control 34 180 degree cone														
864	6	2	Water Prison Technique	Suirou no Jutsu	A burst of water is shot from the hands, traveling at level 4 Speed for up to 200 feet. If any part of the water hits a target a large hollow ball of water will engulf them. The user must then get to and keep one hand against the prison within the next post to maintain it. The prison has no inherent duration; the technique can be held indefinitely as long as the user keeps a hand in place, and the prison cannot be escaped or broken from the inside. If desired by the user, anyone caught in this will experience immense pain as the water causes second-degree burns across the entire body. Though no ninjutsu used within the prison will break it, genjutsu may still be used by those trapped inside. Intelligence 28: Two prisons may be launched simultaneously, still requiring one hand in each to maintain. Intelligence 35: The water may increase in pressure and crack the bones of those caught inside, killing the prisoner if maintained for 3 posts.														
864	6	3	Water Element: Water Shark Blast Technique	Suiton: Suikoudan no Jutsu	This technique creates a large aquatic animal (usually a shark) out of water. The shark possesses Level 12 physical stats while in water and has razor sharp teeth for biting. When on dry land the shark can still flop around but only with Level 3 physical stats. If struck by any solid attack the shark will split into two smaller sharks. Each baby shark has Level 2 physical stats regardless of location. Any intact baby that survives 1 post without being hit by a solid attack will regenerate and grow back to full size and stats. Full sized sharks last 3 posts. Power 30: Big shark has Level 4 physical stats on dry land. Power 37: Big shark has Level 5 physical stats on dry land. Control 30: Big shark splits into 3 sharks upon destruction Control 37: Small sharks have Level 3 physical stats. Reserves 29 Big shark has Level 14 physical stats in water Reserves 36 Big shark has Level 17 physical stats in water														
864	6	4	Waterspout Technique	Mizubashira no Jutsu	Can only be used on a wet target. A swirl of water appears, ringing a target's feet and then spiraling upward in a 3 foot radius. This twister will lift anything in the radius it off the ground, searing anything inside with boiling water while it does so. The Waterspout is 50 feet tall and can move after being formed at Level 6 Speed. Lasts 3 posts.														
864	6	5	Exploding Steam Clone Technique	Bakuhatsu Jouki Bunshin no Jutsu	Five clones of the user emerge from a source of water. These clones have no ability to use jutsu. However, they possess Speed stats twice that of the user (with bonuses), with level 1 Strength and Stamina to compensate. At the will of the user, the clones can be individually detonated with the force of an explosive tag. If struck by any attack, they will also explode. When they explode each one sends out a great amount of hot water and steam, inflicting third-degree burns on anything caught within a 5 meter radius of the clone.														
864	6	6	Water Element Air Rifle	Suiton Kuukijuu	The user positions his index and middle finger together, forming a spiked two-inch cap of water over his fingertips. This water can be released simply by pointing and aiming and is launched at a speed incredible enough to carry the water bullet for up to a mile. While in flight, the bullet is spinning to maintain accuracy and also to cause greater damage to the target, with the ability to pierce even through steel. Due to the concentration needed to perform this jutsu, it cannot be done in combat unless there is at least 100 feet of space between the user and the target														
864	7	1	Wrath of the Sea	Ikari no Unabara	This jutsu forms the torso of a giant, watery being from the ground, around the user. The being can take any shape the user desires, but must have a head and two arms. The 'head' is about 100 feet from the ground, and its each of the arms are up to 100 feet long and 10 feet in diameter at the fist. When the user moves, the Wrath mimics that movement. The Wrath is made up of boiling hot water, and attacks with physical Levels equal to 14 plus 4 additional physical Levels if the user is severely injured. The user is guarded by the Wrath as well, and can nullify ninjutsu of up to Stage 5 or physical attacks below level six. This jutsu lasts for 2 posts, and on the third post, the giant will leap off of the ground at a target, dousing and slamming the designated area. During the 2 posts the Wrath is active, the user may not perform any other jutsu.														
864	7	2	Water Element: Rising Blast	Suiton: Suishouha	By opening a gate to the ocean, the user can flood a battle field with immense quantities of sea water. A large seal is carved on a surface and from it a portal is torn open, which immediately begins pumping wave after wave of salty liquid out of it. This will quickly fill a 250 foot radius with water between 8 to 10 feet deep. The water then does not dissipate for the duration of the battle, as the portal will continue to pump water out as fast as it drains away. If the user moves away from the area of effect of the seal, the portal closes.														
864	7	3	Water Element: Water Dragon Blast Technique	Suiton: Suiryuudan no Jutsu	A large, detailed monster is created from a water source, usually in the shape of the infamous Leviathan. The construct is large enough to rival the ancient bijuu and attacks with the same ferocity, surging forward and ravaging the land as it seeks out a single target. The creature lasts until it hits its target, striking with a physical Level of 21 but losing 2 physical Levels each post it fails to land a blow on its target. While the dragon is active the user may not use any taijutsu, ninjutsu, or move from the location they used the technique from, as they must continue doing hand seals for each post the dragon is active. Doing so immediately causes the dragon to fall apart.														
864	7	4	Tsunami Technique	Tsunami no Jutsu	Requires an ocean to be nearby, no more than two miles away. An enormous 250 foot tall tsunami can be summoned to strike the user's location. There is a one post delay before the tsunami makes landfall while it travels across land. This technique floods and destroys everything between its target location and the ocean. Due to the widespread and indiscriminate destruction that it wreaks, this technique is not to be used lightly.														
864	7	5	At One's Last Gasp	Kisokuen'en	The shinobi forms a small orb of water in his palm and launches it at the target. If the hit connects, regardless of which part of the target's body it hit, the water will splash and scatter, then swiftly climb onto the victim's head and reform as a layer of water that is impossible to remove. For a silent approach the water can remain in place for 4 posts, usually resulting in drowning as no sound can escape the technique. The water can also be heated to encase the target's head in boiling water, making a loud popping noise in the process but killing in 2 posts instead. Finally, if there is an open head wound on the target, the water can be made to instantly kill them after 1 post of very noisy pressurization. Survival is possible in each case but requires drastic, immediate, and crippling action by the target to do so.														
864	7	6	Annihilation Wave	Zenmetsu Nami	An immense ball of scalding-hot water is formed overhead, no more than 500 feet high. The sphere has a radius of 250 feet and is so massive it can be seen for miles, darkening the land beneath its shadow. After the first post, the steam the sphere emits will conceal it entirely, as if it has been swathed in a giant cloud. Superheated water can rain down anywhere below the levitating sphere at the user's command. The presence of this giant water sphere also passive heats up all water directly underneath it and causes it to boil. All water techniques used while the sphere is present will be passively augmented with boiling hot water as well. For the duration the user is rendered immune to damage from heat. After 3 posts the sphere evaporates peacefully and a cool rain falls from above. The sphere will always stay centered right above the users head unless otherwise made to stay put.														
863	1	1	Sinking Feeling	Kanraku Kibun	: The affected target feels a force pushing down on a particular part of their body, equal in Strength Levels to the highest Stage known in this list, and growing by 2 Levels each post after the first. Each post of duration that passes the user may designate another body part that gets 'pushed' down with this force by pointing at it, but only if the target sees them perform this gesture. Each additional location a 'push' is placed costs one more usage. Trigger: Eye contact.														
863	1	2	Crab Walk	Kani Hokou	: The victim of the jutsu feels compelled to walk sideways like a crab. They may choose to move normally and ignore this compulsion, but forcing their body to move in such an awkward way causes one of their feet to fall asleep for the rest of the thread, or until they spend at least one post walking like a crab or standing still. If they do choose to move like a crab they are able to do so fluidly without any issues. Trigger: Hearing the user speak.														
863	1	3	Exploding Kunai	Bakuretsu Kunai	: An item is touched by the user and charged with a genjutsu, which causes a small, barely visible seal to form on its surface. Whenever any other target touches the designated item it visually explodes, but otherwise causes no sound or sensation. The explosion is like that of a firework, with a short burst of colored flame and smoke that otherwise does not impair eyesight. The illusion only lasts 1 post for that person touching the item, but the 'charge' on the item lasts the entire thread until someone touches it. Trigger: Touching the item.														
863	1	4	Mud Clone Skill	Doro Bunshin no Jutsu	: This jutsu creates the illusion of bunshins that try to reassemble themselves after being hit. These bunshin can throw kunai or perform attacks, but if those attacks hit they do nothing, revealing the bunshin as illusions. Two clones may be created for each Stage known in this list. Trigger: Seeing the user's real body.														
863	1	5	Force Ninja Arts: Fact Change	Shiiru Ninpou: Koji Aratameru	: A numerical fact the target knows can be changed. This is limited to changing the fact to another nearby number. The number can't be changed to 0, and 0 can't be changed to anything. Discretion is required as this only changes the number, and does not force the target to believe it. If the user selects too big or too small a number, such that it violates other information the target has or is just an unreasonable large change (such as changing a payment by millions of dollars), the genjutsu will fall apart. Discrete. Trigger: Hear the user's voice														
863	1	6	Water Splashing Festival	Mizukake Matsuri:	: While under this genjutsu, each time the user snaps their fingers, the target feels like someone threw a cup of cold water in their face. This technique can be used once per post, decreasing its duration by 1 each time it is used, without costing an additional action after the first post. Posts it is not active do not decrease its duration. Fragile. Trigger: The user snapping their fingers														
863	2	1	Water Prison Technique	Suirou no Jutsu	- Illusionary Version: The user performs the hand seals and places his hand near the opponent. If the hands are seen a hollow ball of water forms around the target with the user's hand inside the bubble. The bubble will appear big enough to cover an area a bit larger than the target, much like a coffin would. Any action which penetrates the bubble breaks the illusion. If the target themselves break the bubble, they incur a penalty, however any other source that breaks the bubble simply ends the genjutsu. If the target incurs the penalty then the next genjutsu they are hit by in the thread has no maximum duration and a minimum duration of 2 posts. Trigger: Place hand near opponent														
863	2	2	Hidden Mist Technique	Kirigakure no Jutsu	: A highly effective cover technique which blankets an area in a thick fog, confusing the senses of a target. This fog only affects vision and sound is otherwise impeded. There is also a bit more visibility than the original ninjutsu, allowing for vision up to 2 feet. The genjutsu is broken for all affected targets when any one of them is within 2 feet of the user. Trigger: Hearing the user speak.														
863	2	3	Heavy Water Technique	Atsubottai Mizu no Jutsu	: Any body part which touches water seems to absorb it, causing it to feel swollen and less responsive, as if it has been numbed. The feeling can be removed by drying off the body part, but the duration of the technique only decreases in posts where some portion of the target is under the effect of the illusion. Fragile. Trigger: Physical contact.														
863	2	4	Force Ninja Arts: Sea Priest	Shiiru Ninpou: Umibozu	: A fake memory is instilled in the target. This memory is from their early childhood, and has them traumatized by a specific subject matter. That subject can be an item, an animal, an event, etc. The user can decide what the subject matter of the memory is, but not the specifics of the memory. When the duration of the technique ends the target can still remember that moment, but they will realize the memory was fake. Discrete. Trigger: Hearing the user's voice.														
863	2	5	Force Art: Assurance	Shiiru Ninpou: Hoshou	: After handing an item to a non-hostile target, the user requests that the target keep it safe for them as a favor. The target will oblige and keep the object on their person unquestioningly, provided the object isn't obviously dangerous or illegal or too difficult for them to move. While not compelled to do so, the target may also transport the object to the safest place they have access to, such as a lockbox, or hand the time over to another person who can keep it safe (which transfers the genjutsu to them). The effect ends immediately if the target believes themself to be in danger from any source, or if the target is already hostile to the user. The duration is always set by the first target to hold the item, and durations are transferred each time the object changes possession. Discrete. Trigger: Being given an item.														
863	2	6	Hand Water	Chozuya	: A tremendous, agonizing thirst is imposed on the target. Every post they do not drink some liquid, the duration of the technique does not decrease. At least one mouthful of liquid must be consumed in a post for the duration of the technique to decrease. Trigger: Physical Contact.														
863	3	1	Crashing Wave Technique	Tsuiraku Nami no Jutsu	: For the duration of the technique, whenever the user makes a 'pushing' motion with their hand, the target will believe themselves to be pushed in a similar direction by an unseen force. This provides the illusion of force but not the compulsion, so it may be resisted, though if the target doesn't move in the indicated direction they'll feel like they took a direct hit equal in Strength to the user's highest Stage in this list, plus 2 more levels for each other genjutsu the target has been affected by in the thread. This technique fails and breaks instantly if the target is incapable of willingly moving in the pushed direction, IE if they are bound, trapped, etc. Trigger: Seeing a hand motion from the user.														
863	3	2	Choke Technique	Tsukaeru no Jutsu	: Any time the target tries to speak while under this genjutsu, they instead begin to cough and sputter as if they inhaled water. This doesn't make speech impossible, but communicating while under this effect is still very difficult. Any techniques which require speaking are impossible while under this genjutsu. Trigger: Hearing the user cough.														
863	3	3	Displacement Technique	Chikan no Jutsu	: The user may appear to the target to be up to one foot away from their actual position, plus another foot for each Stage known in this list. Fragile. Discrete. Trigger: Eye contact														
863	3	4	Drip Drip	Botabota	The noise used in the trigger will occur repeatedly in the target's ear, and sound as though it is coming from somewhere nearby. If the target attempts to find the source, the sound will move somewhere else nearby. The user may change the location of the sound to any location they wish as a free action during their posts. This will continue indefinitely until the technique ends. The sound source for the trigger can vary in volume from as soft as a footstep to as loud as a whispered word. Trigger: Hearing any noise generated by the user.														
863	3	5	Lament of the Drowned Woman	Oborerujo no Aitou	: An emotional response which causes tears to form is imposed on the target. This doesn't have to be from feeling sad, and could be from any kind of emotion (including anger or pain if necessary), so long as it causes tears. They may even cry without feeling any particularly strong emotion. It's up to the target to determine what would cause that specific response. If the target is incapable of crying under any circumstances whatsoever or if they choose to resist the jutsu entirely, then instead they will suffer a penalty of 1 less Stage of Genjutsu training for the rest of the thread. Discrete. Trigger: Hearing a request.														
863	3	6	Force Art: Duo Act	Shiiru Ninpou: Manzai	: The target finds the user hilarious for the duration. If the user tells a joke and the target laughs at it, nothing else happens. If the target attempts to perform an action before laughing at the joke, or holds in their laughter, the duration of this technique does not decrease. When the technique is over the target will be very aware they were under a genjutsu, and will be immune from this technique for the rest of the thread. Discrete. Trigger: Telling a joke.														
863	4	1	Drowning Assassination	Suishi Hitokiri	: As long as the trigger remains in place, the target will believe they are drowning. After 3 posts in this state, they will pass out harmlessly. They may be awoken again by any method that would normally wake someone up from their sleep. If the target's head is submerged in water, this technique only takes 1 posts to take effect. Trigger: Place both hands on victim.														
863	4	2	Bubble Technique	Awa no Jutsu	: Every time the target uses an attack against the user, it will appear to connect, only for the user to 'pop' like a bubble and disappear, before eventually reappearing in a flurry of bubbles. Effectively grants a few seconds of invisibility to the user against the target each time they try to attack, and grants a full post of invisibility if the user is actually hit by an attack. The duration only decreased in posts where the target takes offensive action against the user. Fragile. Trigger: Seeing the user's body.														
863	4	3	Illusionary - Water Curtain	Mizu Taremaku	: For the duration of the technique, the target cannot see anything that is submerged in water. Water itself will appear solid black, like ink. If the target themselves are underwater, they are rendered completely blind. Trigger: Eye contact														
863	4	4	Falling Asleep to the Sound of the Ocean	Namimakura	: The target, once affected, will immediately be overcome with the desire to engage in whatever comfort or luxury they have on hand. On the small scale this often means taking a smoke break, getting a drink of alcohol, or stopping their patrol to sit down and rest, but can also convince those afflicted to take more significant actions like taking a nap or going out for a long stroll. Those who refuse to engage in even a little indulgence will find themselves growing increasingly irritated, culminating in a large migraine that persists for the rest of the thread until they do partake in their chosen comfort. Trigger: Hearing splashing water.														
863	4	5	Poisoned Mist	Kiridoku	: Any water outside the target's body that they touch while under this genjutsu generates a large amount of searing pain, as if it was acid. This includes water sources such as mist and ice, and consumed liquids. The target must be aware of the water they are touching for this to have an effect. Trigger: Hearing the user.														
863	4	6	Bloodletting Needle	Shirakushin:	: For the duration of this technique, whenever the user points at a target's body, the target feels a pinprick at that location followed by experiencing a pressurized geyser of blood shoot from the site. While the blood feels, smells, and tastes real, the target suffers no other ill effects from the technique. Trigger: Seeing the user														
863	5	1	Flash Flood Technique	Teppoumizu no Jutsu	: The target will experience every memory and sensation the user has formed since the start of the thread, over the course of the duration of this technique. This includes pain and other genjutsu the user may have experienced. For short durations, this revelation of memory tends to be incomprehensible, while over longer durations it is easier to understand. The memories may be selectively edited by the user, and the duration lengthened or shortened for consenting targets and while outside of combat. This technique, while overwhelming, does not paralyze or remove the other senses of those affected. Trigger: Physical Contact.														
863	5	2	Water Bind Technique	Suishibari no Jutsu	: Dry limbs and body parts feel tremendously weighed down and hard to move. No offensive actions may be used by the target while dry. If certain limbs are actually physically wet, those limbs may perform actions normally, and completely dousing oneself in any liquid will end the technique immediately. The one exception is for blood- the target's own blood will not suffice, and only blood from an outside source will meet this criteria. Trigger: Seeing the user.														
863	5	3	Maelstrom Technique	Kachuu no Jutsu	: For the duration of the technique the target's vision will continuously rotate a full 360 degrees each post at a constant rate, as if they were being spun around on a pinwheel. Even their internal equilibrium will feel like their body is being rotated, making all complex physical actions difficult. Trigger: Seeing the user's body.														
863	5	4	Arctic Ocean Dip	Hokkyokuyou Shaku	: A tremendous chill overtakes the target, which also affects all allies they have in the thread. In normal living targets, this only causes them to be overcome by an immense cold for the duration. However, all non-human allies such as summons, bunshin, or constructs become completely frozen by the effect for its entire duration. Fragile. Trigger: Eye contact														
863	5	5	Force Art: Precious Steel	Shiiru Ninpou: Tamahagane	: A small seal is placed on an object, making the entire object the trigger for anyone who looks at it. When affected by this genjutsu, the target(s) will replace whatever 'precious' item is in their head with that object with the seal on it. This could even be in the place of a person. The seal lasts on the object for each usage the user consumes when forming it, and reapplies it's illusion at no usage cost to anyone who sees it as long as the seal is in place. Discrete. Trigger: Seeing a marked object.														
863	5	6	Squeeze	Shiboru	: After this technique is triggered, whenever the user clutches their fingers in a fist, a specific body part of the target experiences painful pressure as if being crushed. Based on how hard the user squeezes the power of the crushing can vary, up to a maximum Strength Level equal the user's highest Stage in this list plus the number of posts the target has been under a genjutsu in the thread. Although this can make the target feel as though their bones are being snapped in half, it doesn't actually impair motion at all. . Trigger: Smelling blood.														
863	6	1	Water Reverse Flow Technique	Mizu Gyakuryuu no Jutsu	: For the technique's duration, the target's control of their body is mirrored. If they try to use their left arm, instead they'll use their right arm, if they try to dodge left they'll go right, etc. They will also talk in a scrambled, backwards way, though this manifests differently for each individual. Sensations are also mirrored, so an injury on one leg feels like it happened on the other. Most notably this prevents the use of normal handseals, as they must be performed upside down relative to how the target normally uses them in order to function properly. Trigger: Physical contact														
863	6	2	Limitless Ocean	Museigen Enkai	: The target is filled with immense, unending confidence, and believes themselves to be supremely powerful and unbeatable for the duration of the technique. They won't feel pain or react to damage, or feel themselves running out of chakra. As a result they are completely unable to control themselves properly, gaining an extra 2 Level in all Physical stats but damaging their body should they choose to exploit that, incurring a penalty of 2 Level in all stats (to a minimum of 1) for the rest of the thread once this technique concludes. In addition they may use techniques at their maximum scaling for the duration of this technique, but suffer a penalty of paying 2 usages per technique instead for the remainder of the thread. All sensations are likewise heighted, and all pain ignored for the duration of the technique is doubled at its conclusion. If used on themselves, this technique only has a duration of 2 posts. Trigger: Eye contact														
863	6	3	Piranha Food	Pirania Sesshoku	: The target is overtaken by an all consuming hunger. They may take no offensive action in a post while affected by this hunger, unless they eat at least one mouthful of something solid first. The duration of this technique only decreases each post the target consumes at least a mouthful of something solid. The consumed substance does not have to be actually edible- swallowing a mouthful of sand can suffice, provided they are able to get it down. Fragile. Trigger: Seeing the user's body.														
863	6	4	Squid Squeeze	Ika Sukuizu	: A single noodly appendage, most often in the form of a squid tentacle, bursts out of any surface the user designates by pointing at them. This tentacle will lash out at the target with a Strength and Speed Level equal to the highest Stage they know in this list. If the target is not struck by the tentacle then the user can have twice as many spawn in the next post. If the target are struck by the tentacle, then the duration on all genjutsu they are currently under (apart from this one) is increased by 1 post for each tentacle they are hit by. Trigger: Physical Contact														
863	6	5	Siren's Nightmare Lull	Muma Nagi no Sairen	: For the duration of the technique, those listening to the user feel a strong compulsion to face towards and move towards the user. Those who refuse to move or move away from the user suffer a penalty of 2 Levels to all Physical stats each post they do, to a minimum of 1. All stat losses persist even when the duration of the genjutsu is complete, and can only be removed by making physical contact with the user. In addition for this technique to continue working and for the stat penalties to persist, the user's voice must be heard by the target each post. Trigger: Hearing the user														
863	6	6	Force Art: Hypnosis	Shiiru Ninpou:	: The affected target receives a compelling order they recognize as foreign inside their head. If they perform the action as ordered, then all genjutsu they are currently under are immediately canceled (including this one). If they refuse, then for each post of duration this technique is active, the voice grows louder and more distracting, removing all taijutsu or other stat bonuses while active and causing all scaling on techniques to remain at their minimum possible Stage, and disabling all passive techniques (including seal bonuses) the target might possess. Discrete. Target: Hearing the user speak.														
863	7	1	Typhoon Winds and Clouds	Gufuu Fuuun	A torrential rainfall and terrifying gusts of wind begin to batter the entire battlefield, affecting every individual in an enormous area, essentially inflicting the illusion on every person in the thread regardless of distance regardless of if they are even aware of the user at all. The rain blocks all sounds and sights coming from outside, and for anyone caught in the rain, both hearing and sight past their arm's reach is impossible. The duration of this technique only decreases each post the affected targets spend outside in the storm, if they remain in cover the genjutsu persists indefinitely. Trigger: Knowing the user is nearby.														
863	7	2	Force Art: Checkmate	Shiiru Ninpou: Tsumi	: The affected target believes they have been completely and utterly defeated by their foe, which is often the user but doesn't have to be. Regardless of the current situation, a series of false memories of recent events leads the target to the conclusion they have been bested by the user, and are at their mercy, and that any move will be countered instantly and mean their defeat or death. This technique only imposes the belief and false knowledge of defeat, and does not require any specific action from the target otherwise. When this technique finishes, the target will be aware that they were under an immensely powerful genjutsu for the duration, but retain their memories of the illusion. Discrete. Trigger: Hearing the user.														
863	7	3	Hidden Battlefield Technique	Fukuzai Senjou no Jutsu	: A set of 4 seals are placed in an area no larger than a 50 foot by 50 foot perimeter. Everyone outside the seals will not perceive anything wrong with whatever might be inside the seals, even if it's the site of a bloody massacre. Anyone inside the seals perceives everything normally. The duration of this technique only decreases once the user leaves the boundaries of their seals. The technique otherwise ends immediately if any seals are damaged or removed. Trigger: Being outside the seals														
863	7	4	Body Melt	Shishigotai Tokasu	: All targets who meet the trigger requirement become mentally connected, although they aren't aware of this. If a genjutsu is used on one target, all targets are affected by it. This includes durations, and all targets are forced to use the genjutsu training of the individual who was hit originally. If any of the connected targets are killed or rendered unconscious, they are removed from the link, but the others all experience significant mental shock as if dying themselves for that post. Trigger: Being touched by the user at any point in the thread.														
863	7	5	Deep Pressure	Fukai Oshi	: While under this technique, the target cannot lie, and is compelled to reveal truths even when not asked. Every second that passes where they aren't revealing information they don't want others to know causes a pressure to build in their skull. If more than a post goes by and the target hasn't revealed a secret or any significant information, the imposed migraine will cause them to lose access to all techniques, taijutsu, and bonuses for the rest of the thread until they do. If the user asks a question and the target does not answer it with a true and meaningful factual statement, then the duration of this technique does not decrease in that post, and they incur the penalty. Trigger: Eye contact.														
863	7	6	No Trace Technique	Atokatanai no Jutsu	Trigger: See the handseals of the technique Upon triggering, the target forgets the last 2 posts. Every post of duration afterwards the target has their memory wiped for one more post. When this jutsu's duration ends, the target forgets all the posts between the initiation of the jutsu and the jutsu's end. Discrete.														
862	1	1	None	Teachings of the Tanshin Lesson I: Wilderness Survival	The first lesson the Tanshin pass on regards how to survive alone, with little-to-no supplies out in nature. With these teachings, the Tanshin is knowledgable when it comes to how to find food and shelter in the wild, what to eat and what not to eat, how to tell time based on shadows and the sun's location in the sky, etc. Basically, this lesson gives them the skills and the know-how of a very experienced camper.														
862	1	2	None	Water Marks: Sealing Tattoos	Tanshin are expressive people, so you'll likely find one with a tattoo or a piercing somewhere on them. This jutsu uses moisture in the body to basically alter colours, fill in holes, and cover up any marks - scars, tattoos, piercings, and any other unnatural mark on the body - so that in case of capture, or in case an enemy is observant, these marks won't giveaway the identity of the Tanshin.														
862	1	3	None	Sharpen	By coating an item with water, the Tanshin can add an edge that makes the item much sharper than it was before. The extra edge of water is very concentrated - but will lose its concentration and disperse by the start of the user's next post once the user has let go of it. Edge is sharp enough to cut through flesh, but not deep. Stage Two, Edge is sharp enough to cut through flesh, fabric, and bark. Stage Three, Edge is sharp enough to cut through flesh deep, but not through bone. Duration: Stage Four, Edge is sharp enough to match a kunai in sharpness.														
862	1	4	None	Leaf in a Stream	Balance is important for many of the things the Tanshin do, but one thing that is very important to the clansmen is the tradition where they bring the new orphans back to their island. Part of this tradition is bringing the orphans back on one of the Tanshin's tiny boats. These boats are controlled entirely by the Tanshin through chakra manipulation, and without oars. What this jutsu does is allow a Tanshin to steer something and keep it afloat on water. This jutsu does not allow the Tanshin to walk on water, nor does it allow the Tanshin to steer something on anything but a watery surface (they cannot even steer something on a different type of liquid - it must be water).

862	2	1	None	Teachings of the Tanshin Lesson II: Wilderness Communication	Sometimes out in the wild, it's hard to contact an ally or call for reinforcements. In those cases, it's alright to rely on the help of the wild. A Tanshin is connected enough with nature to appear trusting to woodland creatures small and not-so small (squirrel - deer). Not enough to get them to fight for them, but enough to get them to approach you and carry notes back and forth. A Tanshin can also rely on them not to scatter frightened in their presence, and if one is impeding the Tanshin, he/she may need only the gentlest of nudges to get the critter to piss off.														
862	2	2	None	Water Light Inversion	This jutsu is a bit trickier than the others. Using water vapor in the air, the Tanshin concentrates their chakra into the atmosphere, manipulating the light the vapor reflects and absorbs. Basically, the purpose of the chakra channeled into the vapor is to reverse how light hits it. The end result is a full color inversion. All the color in the affected area becomes inverted, and on top of that, it also becomes much brighter. This jutsu can be confusing and harmful for the eyes. As the Tanshin is physically manipulating the vapor, this is still ninjutsu, and it also affects him. The only difference is, the Tanshin is prepared for it. Jutsu's range is 3 meters in radius Stage Three, jutsu's range is 4 meters in radius Stage Four, jutsu's range is 5 meters in radius Stage Five, jutsu's range is 8 meters in radius														
862	2	3	None	The Scent of the Hunt	When a Tanshin is after uneasy prey, he may need to mark his target to make sure that even if he escapes his sight, he won't be impossible to track. By focusing chakra in his mouth, the Tanshin spits up a stream of seemingly-regular water, with absolutely no harmful effects. Damage isn't what it's meant to do. This stream smell wretched, and once hit by it, its target is marked. The scent can be detected easily by the Tanshin up to a mile away, and does not disperse unless the target sheds the clothing it's tainted, or manages to successfully flee (IC: the target manages to elude his tracker; OOC: the target leaves the thread)														
862	2	4	None	The Hidden Face	For the actual Tanshin to use on himself, this technique isn't of much use at all. To use on another, however, it can be quite helpful. Much like Henge, this jutsu allows for a change in appearance. By performing the necessary seals and placing his/her hands on a face, the Tanshin may create a thin mask of water that expands to cover the entire head. The full-head mask changes the appearance of the targets head, like a concentrated Henge that will not come off during combat. This mask may be removed by focusing chakra into it, so attaching it to the face of an unwilling shinobi would be fruitless. However, if your aim is to disguise a non-shinobi client so that they may escape detection, this jutsu might be right up your alley.

862	3	1	None	Teachings of the Tanshin Lesson III: Hunting and Tracking	If your job's to catch someone, you need to catch them, be they man or beast - a Tanshin never loses his prey. To be able to do so, you need to keep your eyes open and be observant. A Tanshin is taught to observe nature and take note of anything out of place: foot prints, broken twigs, strange noises or the lack thereof. The Tanshin at this stage is able to track someone through the wilderness based on the subtle hints they leave behind them. As well, a Tanshin begins to follow his nose, as well as his ears, and may notice abnormalities quicker than your average shinobi.														
862	3	2	None	Liquid Sheathes	With this passive jutsu, the user can store an infinite amount of stuff on his person without it weighing him down. The user's inventory is stored in water pouches attached firmly to his body in a way that condenses any objects within it. You could literally hide an object the size of a sledge hammer in these pouches.														
862	3	3	None	Reflection Shield Water Wall	Not the most defensive of shield techniques, this jutsu is designed more to hide than to protect. The user creates a wall of water no taller than him, and just wide enough to cover him. This wall is weak enough to be destroyed by a single taijutsu or ninjutsu based attack. What this jutsu lacks in defense, it makes up in stealth. The water wall presents the image of whatever's behind it, minus the sneaky Tanshin, making the wall, as well as the Tanshin squatting behind it, appear to not be there at all. Were someone to walk around the wall, the Tanshin would be spotted, but you'd have no luck finding him were you to stand facing the wall.														
862	3	4	None	Lone Figure in the Mist	Much like Mist's trademark jutsu, this technique blankets an area in fog. Unlike the Hidden Mist technique, this fog does not impair vision. The fog is thin, not rich, and thus things may be made out in this fog that would otherwise be covered up by the famous Mist jutsu, or even regular fog. In fact, only one thing is hidden in this mist, and that's the Tanshin who made it. The user may blend in with the fog, so that he appears to have disappeared, only reappearing after he's launched a projectile, used another jutsu, or is within 2 feet of someone else (though in this last case, he is only visible to that particular person).

862	4	1	None	Teachings of the Tanshin Lesson IV: Stealth Maneuvering	The Tanshin are known for their ability to covertly move about through the harshest of terrain. This technique signifies the Tanshins mastery over their environment. Any Tanshin with this technique is more than capable of moving about through any environment without disturbing their environment. Using a combination of channeling chakra to the most appropriate area of the body and carefully observing their surroundings, the Tanshin is able to leave an area without having left his mark anywhere. This also means that he is able to move about without making any noises, controlling his breathing so as not to alert any nearby enemies.														
862	4	2	None	Stealth Water Coating	A combination of chakra and water manipulation, the Tanshin draws water droplets from the atmosphere and attaches them to their skin. Once attached, the Tanshin manipulates chakra into the water, creating an eerie light deflecting reaction. The end result: the target area is invisible. Some of the light deflected in this technique can be seen shimmering on the target body part momentarily. The shimmer can only be spotted for a moment, and as fast as it appears the shimmer is gone. Stage 4, 2 posts. Only one body part may be made invisible at a time. Stage 5, 4 posts. Two body parts may be made invisible at a time.														
862	4	3	None	Stealth Weapon Water Coating	Similar to the above jutsu, the Tanshin draws water droplets from the atmosphere, but instead of attaching them to their skin, they attach them to a weapon. The effect is the same, leaving the weapon invisible. Weapons: Some of the light deflected in this technique can be seen shimmering on the target weapon momentarily. The shimmer can only be spotted for a moment, and as fast as it appears the shimmer is gone. Stage 4, 2 posts. Anything with a weapon rating of 5 or lower. Stage 5, 4 posts. Anything with a weapon rating of 10 or lower.														
862	4	4	None	Calcium Deficiency	This technique isn't entirely necessary for those who specialize in the clan's taijutsu. The Tanshin performs the necessary handseals, then all he needs to do is get close enough to his target to touch him with at least one hand. As his hand touches his target, stiff water spindles exit his palm and stick themselves into the victim, disappearing into flesh immediately. The spindles then form a tattoo in the kanji of the word 'fragile' on the victim's flesh, and soon the fun begins. As long as the tattoo is present on the bearer, his bones lose a good deal of strength. Basically, the victim's body is weakened, and though this does not affect his performance, it does affect how easy it will be for the Tanshin to harm him. A punch that would normally cause just a large bruise may also break a bone, and landing or jumping around may result in painful jolts or, if the victim's tried something particularly acrobatic, dislocations or sprains. The tattoo disappears after 2 posts.

862	5	1	None	Teachings of the Tanshin Lesson V: Keeper of Secrets	Sometimes a Tanshin will get captured. It doesn't often happen (except maybe on purpose) but it's best to defend against the possibility. As anyone familiar with the Tanshin should know, while on the job, the success of the mission is the greatest priority, and comes before the well-being of any individual person. And so, the Tanshin needs to be able to hold any secret, and be unbreakable in the face of interrogators. With this skill in hand, the Tanshin will never falter, not under the influence of drugs, pain, or threats to himself or anyone he holds dear. At this stage, the Tanshin can completely separate himself from his job, and is capable of enduring anything as long as he gets the job done. The Tanshin also learns to become adept at lying through his teeth. They're basically actors at this point. Note: torture/information gathering techniques will still prevail if they are of an equal or higher stage than the Tanshin's highest stage in this list.														
862	5	2	None	Tattoo Weapon Seals	Usually done before a mission, the Tanshin performs a specific set of handseals, and a tattoo of the kanji 'blade' will appear on a part of the body of the Tanshin's choice. The Tanshin may activate this jutsu later on in a thread. Where the tattoo once was, a blade of water emerges, as sharp as a regular blade. The blades last 3 posts, and can be detached and flung like projectiles. A maximum of 3 seals may be on a Tanshin's body at any given time. The blade is 1 foot long. Control 22, the blade is 2 foot long. Control 29, the blade is 3 feet long. Control 36, the blade is 4 feet long.														
862	5	3	None	Astral Tanshin Communication	Standing still, the user closes his eyes and concentrates his chakra, focusing his mind. Soon after, an image of the user appears before his body. The image is an eerily translucent bluish-white, and cannot physically touch anything. It makes no sound, has no scent, and is in the user's full control. In essence, it is the user, as he cannot move his body one bit while performing this jutsu. The user sees through the eyes of the image, and is capable of traveling in its form. The jutsu can be cancelled by the image by performing a series of handseals. The main purpose of this jutsu is spying on an area or relaying messages over long distances without physically traveling there. During this mode, the Tanshin can only travel up to 50 meters away from his body. Another function of this jutsu is called Recall. This allows the image to travel great distances in a matter of minutes for the purpose of relaying messages. However, this jutsu can only be used on places the Tanshin has been before, places which would need to be mentioned in their profile or in RP. It takes one post just to reach their destination, another post to relay their message. After that, this jutsu ends and the Tanshin is back in their body. This jutsu takes one post to perform. This jutsu can be dispelled any time after activation, and lasts for 2 posts after being activated. Note: The image can't harm an enemy in any way.														
862	5	4	None	Another Door	For infiltration purposes, sometimes entering through a door or window just won't cut it. With this jutsu, the Tanshin bypasses such entrances. The Tanshin creates a puddle of water on a wall, door, floor, ceiling - basically any surface that leads to another room. Once the puddle is in place, the Tanshin need only walk into it to emerge on the other side of the wall/floor/ceiling he placed the puddle on. The puddle disappears immediately afterwards. This jutsu can only be used on inorganic barriers, and nothing chakra enforced, so the Tanshin isn't capable of walking through trees, jutsu walls, or people.

862	6	1	None	Teachings of the Tanshin Lesson VI: Remember what you See	It is part of a shinobi's job to observe everything, and take careful note of the behaviour of others. By watching carefully throughout a fight, the Tanshin takes careful note of attack patterns, feelings, smells, and any other sensation - he catalogues everything. The next time the Tanshin runs into that enemy, or one who fights with the same taijutsu style, the Tanshin will know what to look out for. This is not an excuse to dodge everything, and it does not enable the Tanshin to perform the techniques of that style; this only allows the Tanshin more preparation than one would have normally, as well as the ability to look out for certain attacks and move accordingly.														
862	6	2	None	Demons in the Fog	For this jutsu to be used, Lone Figure in the Mist must already be activated. Hiding in his thin mist, the Tanshin may activate this jutsu without being detected, and may continue hiding until this jutsu finishes. Formed by the mist itself, blades the size of wakizashis emerge, flinging themselves towards one or multiple targets stuck within the mist. These blades are made of compacted steam, and while they aren't made of the same steel as regular weapons, they're just as sharp. The blades are somewhat hard to see, as they're made of the same substance that comprises the mist, making them more detectable by the shift in the fog than by what they actually look like. These blades can be formed anywhere in the mist, as long as it's at least 3 meters away from anyone aside from the user within the mist. The blades dispel immediately after they've struck or missed their target. 10 blades may be created Tactics 28, 15 blades may be created														
862	6	3	None	Pain for Profit	Sometimes, in order to get what you want, you need to apply a little pressure. In situations where information is needed and the one who has the information is unwilling to give it, a painful incentive is called for. After completing the handseals, the Tanshin places his hands on any part of the reluctant informant. A second later, a tattoo will appear on the target's forehead in the form of the kanji for 'pain'. This tattoo keeps its target in a constant state of excrutiating pain, made dramatically worse with every wrong answer the target provides during questioning. The initial pain is akin to be stabbed in the gut with a jagged, rusty dagger, then having it slowly twisted about. With every wrong answer, the pain goes up a notch, until eventually reaching (after 3 wrong answers) the point where it's like time's slowed down, and the target's body is being chopped to pieces while simultaneously being eaten by a herd of wild animals - so, basically very painful. The tattoo remains on the target until he/she's answered 3 questions, or for 4 posts.														
862	6	4	None	Dark Replacement	Years of tweaking an old favourite jutsu has resulted in what is likely the most ominous, clever, and deceitful technique to enter Hidden Mist - which makes it no surprise that it was devised by the Tanshin. If invisibility and efficiency is what put the clan's name on the map, this is what's kept it there. With regular Henge, a shinobi may copy the appearance of a person, an object, or even an animal, as long as his mass doesn't increase or decrease. The restrictions of that level of illusion are that you may not incur damage while the illusion is up, and no matter how your appearance has changed, you are still you, and not the person or thing you look like. Dark Replacement has no such restrictions. Most of what you need to know about a person can be found in their chakra signature, or in their blood; both are necessary for this jutsu to work. This jutsu essentially makes the Tanshin a walking replica of the person they're Hengeing into. They do not only resemble the person physically, but their personality, as well as every other identifying characteristic is copied as well, and perfectly. Nothing is left to chance; the illusion is perfect. This illusion also does not end when damage has been taken. In order to achieve this perfect illusion, the Tanshin needs to acquire arterial blood from the person they wish to copy. Most often, this will not be given willingly, and so the Tanshin must kill in order to copy their victim. When dealing with normal people, chakra is no object, as they cannot manipulate it, but when it comes to shinobi, each person feels at least slightly different - like a finger print. Dealing with shinobi is different, however, and copying a chakra signature is much more difficult than just bleeding the target. Blood must be taken from a shinobi in the midst of performing a jutsu, or in the case of willing donours, all they need to do is focus their chakra while being bled. The chakra signature imprints itself in the blood, allowing the Tanshin to alter his chakra signature to resemble the targets. Duration: 6 posts, with a 2 post cooldown.

862	7	1	None	Teachings of the Tanshin Final Lesson: Perserverance	Unlike the previous Teaching jutsu, this is not a skill, but an actual technique. Eventually, no matter how skilled a shinobi is, he will meet his match. Shinobi are tools, and it happens; so why not prepare for it? In situations where there's no way out, and the enemy is much too strong, a Tanshin may create a mental block for pain and fatigue. Essentially, this jutsu allows a Tanshin to continue fighting, regardless of his physical condition, just as well as he would fresh into battle, for 2 posts. By the end of those two posts, the Tanshin can no longer fight, and is so worn out that he's completely useless for the remainder of the thread. This jutsu has a 2 thread cooldown.														
862	7	2	None	Unseen Self	Probably their trademark technique, this jutsu allows the Tanshin to achieve the one thing they've been trying to achieve throughout most of this list: invisibility. This jutsu takes one post to prepare, but after it's ready, the Tanshin will be completely unseen. After coating themselves in a thin layer of water, the Tanshin focuses his chakra for that one aforementioned post, and alters the way the water reflects and absorbs light. The end result is a seran-wrap layer of water that leaves the Tanshin unseen, much like the Reflective Shield Water Wall. This jutsu lasts for two posts, and ends immediately after the Tanshin has completed an attack. This means that not until the attack has landed or missed will he become visible, not as he's attacking.														
862	7	3	None	Unseen Enemy	It has been speculated that the reason old man Kankatsu lost his sight was not just because of an illness, but because of this jutsu. It is the pinnacle of Tanshin elimination jutsu, though it severely lacks in the area of stealth. The Tanshin beholds an area filled with his enemies, then performs handseals while never once taking his eyes of his targets. By the end of the final seal, one of the Tanshin's eyes goes black, and the colour of everything is inverted in a sphere of 30 meters in diameter of which the Tanshin is standing behind (the Tanshin is at the edge of the circle, with the center being 15 meters in front of him). Everyone in that circle is doomed on the second post of this jutsu, when colour inversion is the least of their problems. On the second post, the colour of everything goes back to normal, but every living thing within the circle is gone, relocated into a different space, similar to how Jiraiya managed to fit himself within the belly of a small frog, the victims of this jutsu now abide in the dead eye of their Tanshin warden. Alive, until starvation or depression brings an end to them. This technique is used for absolutely clean kills, but does not discriminate between friend and foe. If an ally is within the circle, he too will perish. After this jutsu is used, the Tanshin can only perform jutsu of stage 4 and lower for the rest of the thread. As well, and probably the greatest cost of this jutsu, is that the one eye that went black during the execution of this technique will never see anything again, meaning that this jutsu can only be used twice ever, unless you intend on getting a replacement. Another consequence, though one that has little bearing aside from fluff purposes, is that the only Tanshin who've ever managed to perform this technique have reported being plagued by nightmares involving the peopled they'd killed this way screaming in nothingness, asking someone to see them. The scariest Tanshin campfire story is the one about the people stuck in the dead eyes of their killer.

861	1	1	Hyousetsu Bloodline	None	THIS SHIT MAKES NO SENSE														
860	1	1	Beacon	Houka	* After performing a simple combination of three handseals, whatever the user touches for the next three posts will have a small, glowing circle when exposed to darkness. The circle is six inches in diameter, and under normal light, it shows nothing. While in the dark, it will give off a soft, white glow. Each Beacon lasts for one thread.														
860	1	2	Moonshine	Mitsuzoushu	* Despite its name, Moonshine has nothing to do with alcohol. What Moonshine does is cause any currently existing Beacons to flare up sharply. No damage is done, nor is the flash in any way blinding, it just gives off a bright ray of light. Moonshine is usually used as signal lights, since the Getsuei can control which Beacons to light up.														
860	1	3	Mooncoil	Tsukitaba	By slashing an arc with the index and middle fingers, a bow of pulsing, soft white light is formed in the shape of a boomerang and flies straight towards the target up to 10 feet. Upon hitting a solid object, the Mooncoil will suddenly grow flexible and wrap itself around the victim like regular rope. The coil is no different than regular rope, in actuality. The target can escape by various means: cutting through it, Rope Untying, or even snapping the bonds if the target possesses a Strength level greater than one. Even then, the coil will fade after a single post. A rather elementary technique designed to help Getsuei neophytes learn to harness and mix moonlight with Chakra.														
860	1	4	False Moon	Giji Tsuki	This technique is the first one taught to every Getsuei Shinobi during their Genin career. Simple as it may seem, it takes a slightly heavier toll on one's Chakra reserves than an Academy level technique usually would. Upon completing the necessary handseals, the clan member will slam both palms onto the ground and (verbally) command, "Joutou!" ("Rise!"). Immediately from the ground a boulder will rise high into the air, growing in size and forming itself into a false moon along the way. False Moon cannot be destroyed as it is far too high to reach, and can only be brought down techniques in the Lunar Ninjutsu list cause the moon to decay, or even after a set period of time. Only one False Moon can be in existence at a time. Base Effect: False Moon lasts for three posts. Stage Two Effect: False Moon lasts for four posts. Stage Three Effect: False Moon lasts for five posts. Stage Four Effect: False Moon lasts for six posts. False Moon must be taken for this list. Only techniques labelled with a * do not require this technique.

860	2	1	High Tide	Taku Chouseki	Not so much of an offensive technique, per se, High Tide simply utilises the moon's pull force to pull everything around the Getsuei in a ten foot diameter towards him. Useful for retrieving things like kunai or shuriken (inanimate things that aren't tied down, so no moving people or critters), there's really no other actual direct battle application.														
860	2	2	Low Tide	Hikui Chouseki	The sister technique to High Tide, Low Tide makes use of the moon's push force to push everything around the Getsuei in a ten foot diameter away from him. The only real use for this is to throw projectiles slightly off course (same rules apply as High Tide).														
860	2	3	Lunar Clone	Taiin Bunshin	Formed from lunar energies and Chakra combined, the Lunar Clone looks and sounds exactly like its Getsuei creator. The clone is incapable of using any non-Lunar jutsu, and glows like it's been covered in Beacons when in darkness. It possesses statistics 1/8th those of the clan member. The Lunar Clone can perform one Lunar technique from this list that it has stats for before vanishing. One solid hit will also dispel the clone, just like any other standard bunshin. Base Effect: One clone is created. Stage Three Effect: Two clones are created. Stage Four Effect: Three clones are created. Stage Five Effect: Four clones are created.														
860	2	4	Lunar Relay	Taiin Chuukei	Going into a trance and holding the final handseal, the Getsuei will close his eyes. As long as the user remains in this state, he is given a bird's eye view of the area from the perspective of the False Moon. He is unable of communicating with any allies, limited to the role of a silent spectator.														
860	2	5	Moon Pulse	Tsukimyaku	By concentrating and focusing Chakra, the user releases a burst of Chakra-infused moonlight in the form of a wave that spreads ten feet. Whatever is hit sustains minor cuts and has the Beacon effect upon it.														
860	2	6	Open Slot																
860	3	1	Lunar Minor	Taiin Karui	This is the first of a Getsuei's serious offensive arsenal. After the needed handseals, 1/6th of the False Moon will break off and crumble, only to rain down upon a targeted area. Getting hit by a chunk will cause cuts, as well as a slight (not even 1st degree) burn upon the area of impact. If the real moon is in the sky, however, the False Moon will remain whole. Base Effect: The area is ten feet in diameter. Stage Four Effect: The area is fifteen feet in diameter. Stage Five Effect: The area is twenty feet in diameter.														
860	3	2	Lunar Wind	Taiin Kaze	Another offensive technique, Lunar Wind causes a beam of moonlight mixed with Chakra to streak down out of the sky to strike the target. Lunar Wind can cause cuts and gashes that are minor on the overall scale, but still annoying to deal with if in battle. Base Effect: One beam is fired down. Stage Four Effect: Two beams are fired down. Stage Five Effect: Three beams are fired down.														
860	3	3	Lunar Wall	Taiin Shouheki	Out of moonlight and Chakra, a wall 5 feet by 5 feet and 5 inches deep will form, able to block physical strikes of Strength level two or below, along with Ninjutsu up to and including Stage Two. It's semi-transparent, so Genjutsu requiring eye-contact is still possible.

860	4	1	Tide Compress	Chouseki Shippu	Mixing both High and Low Tide, Tide Compress becomes a handy technique in immobilizing an opponent. After working through the handseals, the Getsuei will slap both palms together and target an existing Beacon on a target. As long as the user's palms stay together, the body part or object with the beacon will slowly be crushed. On a body part, the first post causes discomfort, the second post causes numbing, and the third causes the bone to fracture, while a fourth finally brings about a break. Once the cycle is complete or the user's hands are separated from one another, the pressure is released from the target.														
860	4	2	Lunar Major	Taiin Juuyou	Lunar Major is simply an upgrade of Lunar Minor, but degrades 2/6th of the False Moon, but can be used without consequence under the true moon. Getting struck by one of these fragments could cause bone fractures, 1st degree burns, and cuts, depending upon circumstance (location of injury, etc). Base Effect: The area is fifteen feet in diameter. Stage Five Effect: The area is twenty-two feet in diameter. Stage Six Effect: The area is thirty feet in diameter.														
860	4	3	Eclipse	Ryou	* Requiring one post of preparation (other jutsu may not be used), this technique will blot out the sun during the day, bringing about darkness that hampers regular vision for all those in an area around the Getsuei. Everything will become dark enough that even a hand in front of the face is difficult to make out. Of course, this even affects the clan member too. Other means of sight, such as heat vision, will still function, and night vision will work remarkably well in the pitch zone. The darkness will last for three posts. Base Effect: The diameter is twenty feet. Stage Five Effect: The diameter is twenty-five feet. Stage Six Effect: The diameter is thirty feet.														
860	4	4	Vanish	Soushitsu	Soaking in the light of the moon, the user becomes almost fully transparent, as if someone has toned down their opacity to twenty percent. Although the Getsuei is still able to be seen in this form, it's remarkably harder to do so. This cannot be used in combat. Base Effect: Vanish can be maintained for two posts. Stage Five Effect: Vanish can be maintained for three posts. Stage Six Effect: Vanish can be maintained for four posts.

860	5	1	Moon Element: Moonskin	Tsukiton: Tsukihada	Once the Getsuei finishes the set of handseals, a thin layer of moonlight mixed with Chakra covers his entire body as a defense mechanism. The Moonskin is an advanced type of armor, capable of simply shrugging off any Ninjutsu up to and including Stage Five, and physical blows less than level four Strength. If a more powerful technique is used against the Moonskin, the clan member will still take damage, but will at least be spared a quarter of the damage. This technique is fairly taxing upon the Getsuei's Chakra, and as such, lasts for two posts at most and will render them unable to use Chakra based techniques while Moonskin is active and as well for one post after deactivation.														
860	5	2	Crater	Kakou	Having flashed through the handseals, the False Moon will emit one burst of enormous 'push' forces down upon an area with a diameter of thirty feet. It is as if an invisible pillar were to slam down upon the target, causing a ten foot deep crater. Needless to say, if the target is struck, in almost all cases, he is decked with the wind knocked out of him. A few ribs are usually broken or fractured, and in extreme cases the skull can crack. A big warning sign for the coming of the Crater, however, is that the victim will feel a slight pressure upon his head, like someone's hand is pushing down, a split second before the full force of the technique takes place. Once the target feels the pressure upon his head, all he has to do to evade injury is leave the area of effect, since once the user decides upon the center of the assault, the area becomes static and cannot be changed if the target moves.														
860	5	3	Moonbeam	Getsuei	Gathering Chakra-infused moonlight in a fist, the user can unleash a beam of destructive power able to spear through a foot of stone, or six inches of metal, inflicting second degree burns on flesh. This technique is the pride of the Getsuei clan, as it is named after them. Power 18: The range of the beam is fifteen feet. -Power 25: The range of the beam is twenty-five feet. -Power 32: The range of the beam is thirty-five feet. Control 17: Cooldown of three posts. -Control 24: Cooldown of two posts. -Control 31: Cooldown of one post.

860	6	1	Man in the Moon	Jin uchi za Tsuki	The False Moon will crumble away, and within its core is an exact duplicate of the Getsuei. The copy has the same stats as the original, except for Physical, where it's limited to 1/2 of the Getsuei's (with bonuses). The MitM can perform one Lunar technique up to Stage Four that it has the stats for, whether or not the original knows it, before crumbling. For every 2/6ths of the False Moon available, one MitM can be created. A Genin level technique will destroy 1/3 of the Man, Chuunin 2/3, and a single Jounin strike will destroy the entire thing. Upon creating the MitM, the Getsuei must decide upon which technique his clone will perform (stated OOCly).														
860	6	2	Lunar Wrath	Taiin Doki	Channelling a vast amount of lunar energy together, the user will unleash a blast of great proportions. The beam has a diameter of six feet. Anything caught in its immediate path will be scorched and burned severely, if not destroyed. Even those finding themselves close to the beam (one foot) but are not actually hit by it are given first degree burns. Only one beam can be fired at a time, and it requires two posts of cooldown. Willpower 21: The beam travels twenty feet before dissipating. -Willpower 28: The beam travels twenty-five feet before dissipating. -Willpower 35: The beam travels thirty feet before dissipating.														
860	6	3	Ocean and Moon, Balance	Kaiyou soshite Tsuki, Sagaku	Not the most commonly used Lunar technique in this list, the user first places a Beacon on himself, then one upon the target. After speeding through the handseals for OaMB, those marked with Beacons are now bonded in a delicate balance. What happens to one body will also happen to the other, no matter what it is that occurs. If the target's arm is cut off, the Getsuei's arm will be forcibly ripped and severed from the body by Chakra. There are two ways to avoid this technique: 1) Don't get marked with a Beacon, or 2) Strike the other's Beacon marking to cancel the Balancing. Please do note that Balancing and then committing suicide or otherwise self-maiming does require opponent permission, or a death-enabled thread.

860	7	1	Lunar Strike	Taiin Sougikoui	Upon achieving Lunar Relay, the Getsuei can now fire a apocalyptic beam down from the heavens upon a desired target. This technique is good in bypassing static defenses, and is usually used when attacking a stronghold. Anything caught in the beam's path is instantly incinerated, leaving a mound of molten slag. Even plants too close to the beam are set on fire. The Lunar Strike's beam is thirty feet in diameter.														
860	7	2	Moonfist	Tsukitekken	The Getsuei's strongest personal combat technique, one that can even rival the legendary Rasengan, the Moonfist is a technique that many mistake for the renowned Spiral Sphere. A violent swirl of Chakra-infused moonlight collects on the user's palm, and when struck by it, one feels as if the entire weight of the moon was thrown into the attack. Wood and stone barriers stand no chance, and only a thick wall of metal can hope to deter the force of this tremendous strike (a huge dent is inevitable, though). While easily able to shatter bones and tenderize flesh, the Moonfist is also capable of dealing 3rd degree burns. This can only be performed once per thread														
860	7	3	Divine Armour of Tsukiyomi	Tsukiyomi no Tenrai Yoroi	Upon completing the necessary handseals, the next person that the user touches physically becomes equipped with a shining set of golden armour. The plates fasten and buckle themselves on firmly and are unable to be removed by the target. Although the armour renders the victim immune to any technique below Stage Six, after five posts, the armour will then fire off Moonbeams, inwardly. Obviously, this will mean an inevitable death, and the only way to escape this fate is to have somebody else remove the armour from the victim. However, Tsukiyomi doesn't prefer to lend out his armour often for mortal purposes, and as such, this technique can only be performed once in a lifetime.														
860	7	4	Meteor, Final Act of Tsukiyomi	Ryuusei, Tsukiyomi no Shogyou Sougikoui	Total annihilation is what this technique is designed for. After marking himself and three others with Beacons, the Getsuei will complete three posts of handseals. A horrifying godly face (the visage of Tsukiyomi himself) will sprout onto the surface of the False Moon. Then, the False Moon will begin to fall from the sky. During its descent, pieces the size of elephants will break off, eventually leaving the core, about seventy-five feet in diameter. The broken-off pieces will disintegrate from friction against the air, but the core will survive and crush an area of a hundred and fifty feet, bringing fire and devestation everywhere. Tsukiyomi, however, demands a payment for his services. Once the technique has been accomplished, the Getsuei that performed this terrifying jutsu, along with the other three marked with Beacons, will drop dead. NOTE: The False Moon MUST be used with this technique, whether or not the real moon is in the sky.

859	1	1	Beacon	Houka	* After performing a simple combination of three handseals, whatever the user touches for the next three posts will have a small, glowing circle when exposed to darkness. The circle is six inches in diameter, and under normal light, it shows nothing. While in the dark, it will give off a soft, white glow. Each Beacon lasts for one thread.														
859	1	2	Moonshine	Mitsuzoushu	* Despite its name, Moonshine has nothing to do with alcohol. What Moonshine does is cause any currently existing Beacons to flare up sharply. No damage is done, nor is the flash in any way blinding, it just gives off a bright ray of light. Moonshine is usually used as signal lights, since the Getsuei can control which Beacons to light up.														
859	1	3	Mooncoil	Tsukitaba	By slashing an arc with the index and middle fingers, a bow of pulsing, soft white light is formed in the shape of a boomerang and flies straight towards the target up to 10 feet. Upon hitting a solid object, the Mooncoil will suddenly grow flexible and wrap itself around the victim like regular rope. The coil is no different than regular rope, in actuality. The target can escape by various means: cutting through it, Rope Untying, or even snapping the bonds if the target possesses a Strength level greater than one. Even then, the coil will fade after a single post. A rather elementary technique designed to help Getsuei neophytes learn to harness and mix moonlight with Chakra.														
859	1	4	False Moon	Giji Tsuki	This technique is the first one taught to every Getsuei Shinobi during their Genin career. Simple as it may seem, it takes a slightly heavier toll on one's Chakra reserves than an Academy level technique usually would. Upon completing the necessary handseals, the clan member will slam both palms onto the ground and (verbally) command, "Joutou!" ("Rise!"). Immediately from the ground a boulder will rise high into the air, growing in size and forming itself into a false moon along the way. False Moon cannot be destroyed as it is far too high to reach, and can only be brought down techniques in the Lunar Ninjutsu list cause the moon to decay, or even after a set period of time. Only one False Moon can be in existence at a time. Base Effect: False Moon lasts for three posts. Stage Two Effect: False Moon lasts for four posts. Stage Three Effect: False Moon lasts for five posts. Stage Four Effect: False Moon lasts for six posts. False Moon must be taken for this list. Only techniques labelled with a * do not require this technique.

859	1	6	Open Slot																
859	2	1	High Tide	Taku Chouseki	Not so much of an offensive technique, per se, High Tide simply utilises the moon's pull force to pull everything around the Getsuei in a ten foot diameter towards him. Useful for retrieving things like kunai or shuriken (inanimate things that aren't tied down, so no moving people or critters), there's really no other actual direct battle application.														
859	2	2	Low Tide	Hikui Chouseki	The sister technique to High Tide, Low Tide makes use of the moon's push force to push everything around the Getsuei in a ten foot diameter away from him. The only real use for this is to throw projectiles slightly off course (same rules apply as High Tide).														
859	2	3	Lunar Clone	Taiin Bunshin	Formed from lunar energies and Chakra combined, the Lunar Clone looks and sounds exactly like its Getsuei creator. The clone is incapable of using any non-Lunar jutsu, and glows like it's been covered in Beacons when in darkness. It possesses statistics 1/8th those of the clan member. The Lunar Clone can perform one Lunar technique from this list that it has stats for before vanishing. One solid hit will also dispel the clone, just like any other standard bunshin. Base Effect: One clone is created. Stage Three Effect: Two clones are created. Stage Four Effect: Three clones are created. Stage Five Effect: Four clones are created.														
859	2	4	Lunar Relay	Taiin Chuukei	Going into a trance and holding the final handseal, the Getsuei will close his eyes. As long as the user remains in this state, he is given a bird's eye view of the area from the perspective of the False Moon. He is unable of communicating with any allies, limited to the role of a silent spectator.														
859	2	5	Moon Pulse	Tsukimyaku	By concentrating and focusing Chakra, the user releases a burst of Chakra-infused moonlight in the form of a wave that spreads ten feet. Whatever is hit sustains minor cuts and has the Beacon effect upon it.														
859	2	6	Open Slot																
859	3	1	Lunar Minor	Taiin Karui	This is the first of a Getsuei's serious offensive arsenal. After the needed handseals, 1/6th of the False Moon will break off and crumble, only to rain down upon a targeted area. Getting hit by a chunk will cause cuts, as well as a slight (not even 1st degree) burn upon the area of impact. If the real moon is in the sky, however, the False Moon will remain whole. Base Effect: The area is ten feet in diameter. Stage Four Effect: The area is fifteen feet in diameter. Stage Five Effect: The area is twenty feet in diameter.														
859	3	2	Lunar Wind	Taiin Kaze	Another offensive technique, Lunar Wind causes a beam of moonlight mixed with Chakra to streak down out of the sky to strike the target. Lunar Wind can cause cuts and gashes that are minor on the overall scale, but still annoying to deal with if in battle. Base Effect: One beam is fired down. Stage Four Effect: Two beams are fired down. Stage Five Effect: Three beams are fired down.														
859	3	3	Lunar Wall	Taiin Shouheki	Out of moonlight and Chakra, a wall 5 feet by 5 feet and 5 inches deep will form, able to block physical strikes of Strength level two or below, along with Ninjutsu up to and including Stage Two. It's semi-transparent, so Genjutsu requiring eye-contact is still possible.

859	4	1	Tide Compress	Chouseki Shippu	Mixing both High and Low Tide, Tide Compress becomes a handy technique in immobilizing an opponent. After working through the handseals, the Getsuei will slap both palms together and target an existing Beacon on a target. As long as the user's palms stay together, the body part or object with the beacon will slowly be crushed. On a body part, the first post causes discomfort, the second post causes numbing, and the third causes the bone to fracture, while a fourth finally brings about a break. Once the cycle is complete or the user's hands are separated from one another, the pressure is released from the target.														
859	4	2	Lunar Major	Taiin Juuyou	Lunar Major is simply an upgrade of Lunar Minor, but degrades 2/6th of the False Moon, but can be used without consequence under the true moon. Getting struck by one of these fragments could cause bone fractures, 1st degree burns, and cuts, depending upon circumstance (location of injury, etc). Base Effect: The area is fifteen feet in diameter. Stage Five Effect: The area is twenty-two feet in diameter. Stage Six Effect: The area is thirty feet in diameter.														
859	4	3	Eclipse	Ryou	* Requiring one post of preparation (other jutsu may not be used), this technique will blot out the sun during the day, bringing about darkness that hampers regular vision for all those in an area around the Getsuei.

Base Effect: The diameter is twenty feet. Stage Five Effect: The diameter is twenty-five feet. Stage Six Effect: The diameter is thirty feet.														
859	4	4	Vanish	Soushitsu	Soaking in the light of the moon, the user becomes almost fully transparent, as if someone has toned down their opacity to twenty percent. Although the Getsuei is still able to be seen in this form, it's remarkably harder to do so. This cannot be used in combat. Base Effect: Vanish can be maintained for two posts.

858	1	1	Sand Clone	Suna Bunshin	The most elementary of techniques in all of Sand's jutsu, Sand Clone creates a basic clone of the user out of sand. However, this copy is quite useless in trying to fool others by image because it retains the physical appearance of sand. In every other aspect, though, it is an exact duplicate of the user. The clone's stats are one tenth that of the user's base stats + Taijutsu bonuses. It can, if it meets the requirements, perform one Sand jutsu a thread, dispelling itself in the process afterwards. Normally, these clones are defeated after receiving a solid hit. Base Effect: Creates one clone. Stage Two Effect: Creates two clones. Stage Three Effect: Creates three clones. Stage Four Effect: Creates four clones.														
858	1	2	Sand Magnet	Suna Jishaku	This is the first technique taught in the Academy to all aspiring Sand specialists for it is the first step on the path of elemental manipulation. After forming a single handseal, the user holds both palms outwards and open, focusing Chakra into them. Drawn by the jutsu, nearby sand will be pulled inwards around the user. Base Effect: The user can draw sand from ten feet away in any direction, enough to use Stage One jutsu. Stage Two Effect: The user can draw sand from fifteen feet away in any direction, enough to use Stage One jutsu. Stage Three Effect: The user can draw sand from twenty feet away in any direction, enough to use Stage Two jutsu.														
858	1	3	Sand Compaction	Suna Kojinmari	For some, they never leave the desert. For others, the desert never leaves them. However, it can get rather difficult carrying a large amount of sand around, so the Sand Compaction jutsu was created. By taking a small or large sized gourd, the user can cram in an inordinant amount of sand within, more than what a gourd looks capable of holding. In taking on extra sand, the gourd also remains at a standard weight as if it were only carrying a single load. Base Effect: The user can pack in an extra gourdful (small or large, depending on what the character uses) of sand in. Stage Two Effect: The user can pack in an extra two gourdfuls (small or large, depending on what the character uses) of sand in. Stage Three Effect: The user can pack in an extra four gourdfuls (small or large, depending on what the character uses) of sand in. Stage Four Effect: The user can pack in an extra six gourdfuls (small or large, depending on what the character uses) of sand in.														
858	1	4	Sand Projectile Coat	Suna Yadama Ooikakusu	Prior to throwing any sort of projectile, the user can layer it with a fine coat of sand. If the projectile were to hit an enemy, the sand would be deposited in the wound, inflicting a small dose of extra pain to irritate and distract him.														
858	1	5	Conversion of Earth	Tsuchi no Kaishin	Sometimes a Sand manipulator does not get to choose the field of battle and will be forced to fight in unfamiliar terrain with a set of elements completely different from those of the desert. While carrying around a gourd would solve that particular problem, the large container can prove to be unwieldy and burdensome at times, so the Sand Conversion technique was invented as a substitute. The jutsu directly converts the earth (soil and rocks, along with other organic materials such as grass and wood) into sand for jutsu. However, Conversion of Earth has no effect over water and its variants (snow and ice). The amount of earth that is able to be converted into sand is dependent on the user... Base Effect: Can convert earth to sand in a ten foot diameter, enough for Stage One and Two Sand jutsu. Stage Two Effect: Can convert earth to sand in a twenty foot diameter, enough for Stage Three and Four jutsu. Stage Three Effect: Can convert earth to sand in a thirty foot diameter, enough for Stage Five and Six jutsu. Conversion of Earth simply isn't strong enough to supply enough sand for Stage Seven jutsu.														
858	1	6	Sand Track Eraser	Suna Tegakari Fukikesu	A simple but effective technique for those who are fleeing through the desert. Channelling chakra to their feet, this allows the user to generate small bursts of sand with every step. By leaving behind these small bits of sand, the user of this technique is able to erase their tracks. The sand wipes away any trace of a footprint left on any object and then becomes impossible to distinguish from normal sand and soil in the area. Other signs of passing, such as breaking twigs and disturbing plants will remain unchanged. This technique is also not effective at stopping anyone tracking by smell. While very little control is required at the lowest level to perform this technique, those with greater levels of control can exploit this technique for other means. Base Effect: The user can only erase his own tracks. Stage Two Effect: The user can erase three sets of tracks and create a single set of false tracks. Stage Three Effect: The user can erase five sets of tracks and create two false sets of tracks.														
858	2	1	The Third Eye	Daisan no Me	A handy spying technique, the Third Eye requires a single handseal to activate. Grains of sand will then clump together near the user and hover, gradually taking on the likeness of a human eyeball. While unable to move, the eye can rotate freely and will feed visual information back to the user. The user can only have one Third Eye in existence at a time, since the visual information would overload the brain. Creating a second would immediately eliminate the first. The eye can be destroyed by a single attack, but if left alone will disperse after five posts of activation. Base Effect: The user's eyes must be closed if he wants to see out of the Third Eye. Stage Three Effect: The user's eyes must be closed if he wants to see out of the Third Eye, but now the eye can move to follow the user around. Stage Four Effect: The user no longer has to close his eyes to see out of the Third Eye, and the eye can move through the air freely, albeit at a speed none too fantastic (would be unable to dodge attacks; it's merely able to keep up with the pace of battle).														
858	2	2	Sand Shuriken	Suna Shuriken	Through Chakra, the user creates shuriken out of pure sand, giving the grains shape and harmful potential. Then, the shuriken can be launched through bursts of Chakra or by the user's own hand, but once they hit anything, they lose their shape and burst into small puffs of sand. Base Effect: Three shuriken are created. Stage Three Effect: Six shuriken are created. Stage Four Effect: Nine shuriken are created. Stage Five Effect: Twelve shuriken are created.														
858	2	3	Tracking Sand	Tsuitou Suna	It is said that those who flee the desert can never truly escape. It was because of this jutsu that the saying originated. By activating this jutsu beforehand, the user imbues a different Sand jutsu with an extra dose of Chakra. If any of those grains of Chakra-infused sand were to fall upon a target and, for instance, rest between folds of clothing, no matter where the target goes, the user knows exacly what direction they are in. Tracking Sand only requires a single grain to remain upon the target to work, but if it was submerged in water, the technique would immediately lose its effect. Base Effect: The sand retains its tracking ability for two posts. Stage Three Effect: The sand retains its tracking ability for four posts. Stage Four Effect: The sand retains its tracking ability for six posts.														
858	2	4	Sand Shark	Suna Same	No predator is greater than that of the shark, and this technique brings the marine terror to the dunes. Sand Shark creates a two foot long, torpedo-shaped clump of sand with a wicked dorsal fin and a tail. The 'shark' is capable of cutting deftly through sand as if it were water, swimming at a level of Speed equal to half of the user's base Speed (Speed levels according to the user's rank). To attack, the 'shark' leaps out of the ground and forms a gaping maw to latch onto an opponent. Tiny rows of sand teeth bite into the victim to leave a superficial wound about two inches in overall area. One hit destroys a 'shark', but they only last for two posts after activation. Only one can be created at a time.														
858	2	5	Sand Shield	Suna Hogo Sochi	The first in the line of defensive jutsu, Sand Shield creates an oval shaped disc of sand about two inches thick as a stationary barrier. The disc is six feet on its long side and four feet on its short, and will stay suspended in the air so long as the user keeps an open palm facing towards it (for Chuunin and Jounin, the palm is not necessary). While the shield can protect against Stage One and Two Ninjutsu, it is easily defeated by Taijutsu, crumbling to attacks greater than a base Strength of 3 (not the Strength level, but the actual Strength value). The fact that the shield is immobile renders it ineffective against speedy opponents, but in the right hands, this jutsu can be fairly strategic in the outcome of a battle.														
858	2	6	Open Slot																
858	3	1	Sand Sphere	Suna Kyuutai	Sand Sphere is a technique recognized by many Shinobi. By forming the necessary handseals, sand begins to pack together and form a perfect, seamless sphere around the user, covering him from every possible angle of attack. Extremely hard to break through, this jutsu is double edged because the user traps himself inside the sphere, unable to see outside. The final handseal must also be held in place to maintain the technique, so other jutsu cannot be used while the Sand Sphere is in effect. With all of these drawbacks, though, comes a terrific defense. Sand Sphere can block up to Stage Three Ninjutsu and physical attacks of up to and including a base Strength of 9(not the Strength level, but the actual Strength value).														
858	3	2	Sand Shower	Suna Shigure	The user lifts a considerable amount of sand into the air and launches it in a barrage upon the enemy, whether it be from above to rain it down upon his enemy, or from a horizontal lane in a violent volley. However the sand will clump together, resulting in each drop being about the size of a baseball. If the enemy does not get out of the area affected the bombarding orb shaped sand can cause bone fracturing. Base Effect: The barrage can be maintained as long as one post before a one post cooldown. Stage Four Effect: The barrage can be maintained for as long as two posts before a one post cooldown (ending it prematurely still requires the cooldown). Stage Five Effect: The barrage can be maintained as long as three posts before a one post cooldown (ending it prematurely still requires the cooldown).														
858	3	3	Bursting Sand Armour	Panku Suna no Yoroi	The Sand Armour technique of old has been long considered as ineffective and out of date, unable to compete with new jutsu cropping up within villages. Bursting Sand Armour was created in its place. Chakra draws sand all around the user, forming an inch thick dense layer all over that rapidly takes on his exact appearance as if it wasn't even there; while not extremely useful against Ninjutsu, it is quite the opposite against Taijutsu. When struck by a physical attack, concentrated shards of packed sand will shoot outwards, able to gash soft flesh. Even steel is marred by scratches against the burst of shards. Stage Two Ninjutsu and above can pierce the defensive layer, but it takes an immense base Strength of 16(not the Strength level, but the actual Strength value) or higher to punch through the armour and hit the user hidden beneath.														
858	3	4	Sand Replacement	Suna Kawarimi	While some ninja choose to learn the more typical Replacement technique, its Sand variant is more offensive in nature. When the user is struck, instead of switching with a physical object, his body will turn to sand and burst outwards with enough force that the grains of sand will cut the opponent's exposed skin. This counts towards the maximum two Replacements the user can use per thread.														
858	3	5	Sand Cannon	Suna Taihou	Channeling a pocket of Chakra in the throat, the user converts it directly into sand and spits out a ball about twice the size of a basketball. The sphere travels in a straight line for fifteen feet at a swift speed before succumbing to gravity. To be struck by one of these 'cannonballs' would leave a nasty bruise, and to be struck twice in the same spot could easily fracture a bone. Base Effect: One cannonball can be fired at a time. Stage Four Effect: Three cannonballs can be fired at a time. Stage Five Effect: Five cannonballs can be fired at a time.														
858	3	6	Sand Whip	Sunamuchi	After creating the seals and placing both palms on the ground, whip-like tendrils of sand will burst from the ground. The tendrils are fifteen feet in length and, when lashing an opponent, can leave vicious bruises and even tear the skin. While using the whips to constrict an opponent would be a viable tactic, their grip can be broken instantly if the target is equal or higher than the user's rank. In turn, though, the user's hands must always be in contact with the ground, or else the whips will fall harmlessly apart. Base Effect: Two tendrils are created. Stage Four Effect: Three tendrils are created, and they sprout small sand spikes along their lengths to deal gashing damage. Stage Five Effect: Four tendrils are created, and they sprout small sand spikes along their lengths to deal gashing damage.														
858	4	1	Hidden Sand	Sunagakure	A slight misnomer for the actual ability of this jutsu, Hidden Sand allows the user to sink into the ground and 'fly' through it. The ground must be natural (not cement) and, as an extra bonus, if the user is immersed in sand, he travels at two times the normal rate of movement. If not in sand, the user's Speed is capped to a half. The user cannot both enter and exit the ground in the same post. Base Effect: The user can see and breathe normally, but can only stay submerged for two posts. Stage Five Effect: The user can see and breathe normally, but can only stay submerged for three posts. Stage Six Effect: The user can see and breathe normally, but can only stay submerged for four posts.														
858	4	2	Sand Detection	Suna Kenshutsu	Sand Detection was invented as a means to cover up for the weaknesses present in Sand Tracking. By releasing a minute amount of Chakra into a body of sand, the user is able to sense any solid bodies directly on that body of sand and know their exact location. Base Effect: The detection range goes as far as a twenty five meter diameter and the detection lasts for two posts. Stage Five Effect: The detection range goes as far as a thirty meter diameter and the detection lasts for four posts. Stage Six Effect: The detection range goes as far as a thirty-five meter diameter and the detection lasts for six posts.														
858	4	3	Great Arm of Sand	Suna no Futoiude	A huge arm forms from the sand, and tries to grab the enemy with it's large clawed hand. This jutsu usually forms an intro to Desert Coffin, but can also be used as a shield or powerful punch. The arm, both offensive and defensive in nature, can fracture bones with a punch and send an opponent skidding across the earth. In defense, it can sustain physical attacks of up to base Strength 15 and up to Stage Two Ninjutsu. Base Effect: The arm can stretch ten feet. Stage Five Effect: The arm can stretch twenty feet. Stage Six Effect: The arm can stretch thirty feet.														
858	4	4	Idol of Sand	Suna no Guuzou	By packing together an incredible amount of sand into the form of an idol, the user erects a formidable barrier to protect himself from attack. The idol, steeped within the history of Sunagakure, is in the likeness of the One Tail demon, Shukaku, though smaller in stature. Fifteen feet high and seven feet across, the idol can handle Ninjutsu attacks up to and including Stage Three, and physical strikes of up to and including a base of 15. Base Effect: One idol is created. Stage Five Effect: Two idols are created. Stage Six Effect: Three idols are created. Multiple idols can combine and morph to form a bigger idol (two would be twenty feet in height and fourteen feet across, etc).														
858	4	5	Sand Instantaneous Body	Suna Shunshin	Requirement: Power 15, Control 15, Reserves 13, Intelligence 14 An ability which allows the user to transport from one area to another in a gust of sand. The user has to have been to the area before, and be able to sense the location with his own Chakra before being able to transport himself there. This means that the distance is limited to about one mile. Not to be used for combat purposes. This jutsu can only be used to escape combat, and may not be used in the same post if the Shinobi has attacked or defended.														
858	4	6	Open Slot																
858	5	1	Sand Dragon	Suna Ryuu	This jutsu, obviously, creates a winged dragon out of sand. Capable of flight, the beast is also speedy on foot, galloping at a brisk twenty Speed (Speed levels according to the user's rank). With razor claws, the dragon can slash and cause grievous injuries, and if both of its feet are planted firmly on a body of sand, it can open its maw and use the Sand Shower jutsu (at the Stage Four level). Stage Three Ninjutsu or a physical blow of base Strength 16 or higher can fell the creature. A user can only have one in existence at a time, but one is usually all that is needed for the Sand Dragon is a reliable mount that can be counted on. Note: The Sand Dragon possesses its secondary ability (Sand Shower) if the user is Jounin in rank.														
858	5	2	Hungry Desert	Gakidou Sabaku	This jutsu starts by pulling all the sand around the opponents feet and then slowly begins swirling, pulling them gradually into the sand. It is large enough to easily consume up to 3 people, and due to its nature as quicksand, movements such as attempting to jump or wade out of it will only serve to force those caught in it down further. The only sure way to escape is via the user of an anchor attached to something not caught in the sand, such as a kunai with a string tied to it embedded in a tree. As such this can be quite a dangerous jutsu in the right hands. It only takes two posts to fully drag someone under (at that point, the ground grows solid once again, preventing movement), and the victim then usually lasts one or two more posts before blacking out from a lack of oxygen.														
858	5	3	Small Clone Projectiles	Chiisai Bunshin Yamada	By stamping a foot on the ground, the user knocks up a cloud of sand in the direction he's facing. If an unfriendly figure is caught within the cloud, clumps of sand materialize and attempt to latch themselves onto his body. They begin to take shape to become three inch tall clones of the user. Though they of course are not as physically strong as the user, they can still be quite dangerous, especially as they all carry the same equipment as the user possessed, albeit in miniaturized form, causing items the user carried such as explosion notes, to have effects similar to explosive pouches. Note that unique weapons are not recreated. This jutsu requires two posts of cooldown before it can be used again. The clones are easily defeated by simply squashing or stepping on them; even Stage One Ninjutsu can defeat them. The strength of this technique is that it has the potential to create so many that the victim won't be able to get rid of them all before being harmed. 18 Power: The cloud can travel forwards for a maximum of twenty feet. -25 Power: The cloud can travel forwards for a maximum of twenty five feet. -32 Power: The cloud can travel forwards for a maximum of thirty feet. 17 Control: The cloud billows out to fifteen feet across. -25 Control: The cloud billows out to twenty feet across. -33 Control: The cloud billows out to twenty five feet across. 17 Reserves: Eight miniature clones are created. -26 Reserves: Twelve miniature clones are created. -35 Reserves: Sixteen miniature clones are created.														
858	5	4	Desert Coffin	Sabaku Kyuu	A jutsu first seen when used by Gaara of the Desert. Chakra controls sand so that it surrounds the opponent or parts of his body, capturing them completely in sand. Only the face is spared to allow breathing. When the opponent is captured, they may be lifted into the air and may even be attached to something. Breaking out of this is incredibly difficult, even for Taijutsu Specialists, pure avoidance is best when faced with this jutsu. A base Strength of 20 can break the ball of sand, as well as Stage Five and above Ninjutsu.														
858	5	5	Sand Slip	Suna Toufuku	Injuries can make or break a battle for a Sand Shinobi, especially if he were to sustain damage on one or both of his legs. If hurt to a point where the user can't even stand anymore, Sand Slip becomes his best friend. This jutsu allows the user to slide atop the top of sand effortlessly with only a single handseal. 19 Control: The user can slide a total of fifteen feet before having to stop for a one post cooldown. -26 Control: The user can slide a total of thirty feet before having to stop for a one post cooldown. -33 Control: The user can slide a total of forty five feet before having to stop for a one post cooldown. What makes this a handy technique is that as the user slides, he blasts a wake of sand behind him with enough force to sting an opponent's exposed flesh as if it had been rubbed with sandpaper.														
858	5	6	Open Slot																
858	6	1	Raging Sandstorm	Kyoubou Suna Arashi	Special Requirement: Opponent permission or a death enabled thread to use this against or in the vicinity of another character. By drawing out all the sand in the vicinity in a huge wind the user forces all the sand toward their opponent causing an extremely lethal storm of slashing sand particles. The storm of sand is awesome, stripping flesh from bone and full of lethal ability. Those caught within its center are almost always doomed to death because of its sheer ferocity. The farther away from the center that something is, the less damage is dealt so much so that at the very fringes, only minor lacerations are suffered. Sand is also deposited into wounds to heighten the sensation of pain. However, the user must be careful not to be caught within his own cross hairs as the jutsu can also harm him as well. 21 Power: The storm is twenty feet in diameter. -28 Power: The storm is thirty feet in diameter. -35 Power: The storm is forty feet in diameter. 20 Control: The storm can move five feet in any direction from its original point of impact. -28 Control: The storm can move ten feet in any direction from its original point of impact. -36 Control: The storm can move fifteen feet in any direction from its original point of impact. 19 Reserves: The storm lasts for one post. -28 Reserves: The storm can last for two posts. -37 Reserves: The storm can last for three posts.														
858	6	2	Desert Funeral	Sabaku Sousou	Special Requirement: Opponent permission or death enabled thread for use. Desert Funeral is often a follow up technique after Desert Coffin. This technique is usually a kill technique that uses the sand trapping the person to either utterly crush them, or rip them apart. However, it is not necessary that the target be caught within Desert Coffin. So long as any part of the target is completely covered in sand (a leg, an arm, etc), Desert Funeral will cause the sand to rush inwards and crush whatever it has surrounded.														
858	6	3	Desert Explosion	Sabaku Bakuhatsu	After charging a fist with chakra, the user slams his knuckles into the sand, sending what looks like a shockwave of sand at his enemy. In reality, he is delaying the force of the punch and making it travel - to a maximum of fifteen feet - beneath the earth at his opponent. Once the force has reached the desired place, the ninja can make it explode. A ten foot diameter of ground of the user's choosing is thrown into chaos by the explosion, and even the hit does not connect, the flying streams of debris in the air afterwards can make for a good distraction for a different attack. The power of the blast is roughly equal to three exploding tags. 23 Power: The blast is roughly equal to two exploding tags. -30 Power: The blast is roughly equal to three exploding tags. -37 Power: The blast is roughly equal to five exploding tags. 23 Control: The blast area is a ten foot diameter. -31 Control: The blast area is a fifteen foot diameter. -39 Control: The blast area is a twenty foot diameter. 22 Reserves: One shockwave can be sent out. -31 Reserves: Two shockwaves can be sent out at once.														
858	6	4	Parasite Sand	Kiseiseibutsu Suna	While not a technique in and of itself, Parasite Sand is used to modify another Sand technique. After using Parasite Sand, the next Sand jutsu the user employs will have a special property added to them. When the jutsu's grains of sand fall upon an opponent, they will burrow into his skin without leaving a mark. While each individual grain is not particularly painful or damaging the combined effect of several thousand grains of sand can be extremely painful. If the sand is particularly concentrated in one area this technique can even result in a serious injury. The sand remains in the body for two posts, but for every stage of Sand Ninjutsu the user posseses over the target's most dominant list of Ninjutsu, the sand stays and inflicts excruciating pain for an extra post. Conversely, for every stage the target possesses in a Ninjutsu list over the user's Sand Ninjutsu, one post is subtracted from the duration of the jutsu. NOTE: Parasite Sand cannot actually be used to kill (via sending it to vital organs), only inflict massive amounts of recurring pain to the target.														
858	6	5	Blasting Sand Wall	Ijou Suna no Kabe	The user begins the technique by slamming their hands down on the ground, forcing a wall of sand to rise up to shield them from attacks. This sand wall appears little different from other sand defensive jutsus, but its purpose is quite different. Whenever this sand wall receives an attack, it will absorb the attack completely and then immediately send a blast of sand of equal shape and force back at the attacker. For instance if the target created a concentrated stream of fire (such as in Katon Ryuuka), the wall would retaliate with a concentrated stream of sand, while if a kunai with an explosion note attached was thrown at the wall, the wall would send out a thin line of sand moving as quickly as the kunai would towards the attacker, and then after a short distance it would expand drastically, mirroring the explosion of the explosion note. After retaliating the sand wall will reform properly, unless of course the jutsu the attacker used was too powerful for the wall, in which case the wall will crumble. This technique can only be used once per thread. The wall can handle up to Stage Five Ninjutsu and a physical attack of up to base Strength 23 , lest the attack will punch right through and the wall will crumble. 26 Power: The wall is fifteen feet in height. -33 Power: The wall is twenty feet in height. -40 Power: The wall is twenty five feet in height. 25 Control: The wall is fifteen feet in length. -33 Control: The wall is twenty-five feet in length. 24 Reserves: The wall will last for two posts. -33 Reserves: The wall will last for three posts.														
858	6	6	Open Slot																
858	7	1	Quicksand Avalanche	Ryuusa Bakuryuu	By manipulating a titanic amount of sand, the user can create a colossal wave of sand that completely consumes the opponent. Due to the nature of this skill it if the user is standing amid a desert the wave can grow to seventy five feet in height and fifty feet in length. Buildings are crushed by the immense force of the wave; to be caught in its path spells certain death for even the most legendary of warriors. The wave can travel on for a hundred feet and at a blinding speed, making it hard to outrun. If the user knows 'Sand Slip', he can ride unharmed upon the wave as if he was surfing.														
858	7	2	Desert Imperial Funeral	Sabaku Taisou	Perhaps the first apocalyptic jutsu ever created, Desert Imperial Funeral requires a substantial sacrifice of Chakra (nearly half) to force a gross volume of sand in on a specific vicinity. Everything within a fifty foot diameter of the epicenter (that the user targets) will be literally flattened and buried into the sand, creating a giant crater in the ground. To be hit by this jutsu means instant death. This can only be performed twice a thread because of the amount of chakra needed per use.														
858	7	3	Desert Warzone	Sabaku Kousenchitai	Special Requirement: Desert Explosion Much like the Sabaku Bakuhatsu (Desert Explosion) - though the range has now been increased to twenty five feet - the user punches the ground and sends a ripple of Chakra through it. Whatever the wave touches (in other words, whatever is connected to the ground and thus the wave of Chakra) will have the ground beneath it explode with the force of three exploding tags. However, that is only the first barrage; if anything else besides the user is still touching the ground, a second wave is sent out and explodes again with the power of five tags. Continuing even beyond that, if anything has somehow managed to survive the horrific blasts and is still touching the ground - save the user - a third wave will explode yet again with the power of seven tags. The battle scene is pockmarked with huge craters afterwards, with so much debris in the air that visibility is reduced. This terrible jutsu requires three posts of cooldown before and if it can be used again.

857	1	1	Wind Element: Wind Clone	Fuuton: Kaze Bunshin	Wind Clone is a basic technique learned by many Academy students, creating a basic clone of the user from the very wind itself. This copy looks exact like its creator, though it does appear slightly translucent. Its stats are one tenth of the user's base stats and Taijutsu bonuses. If it meets the requirements for a Wind jutsu, it can use that jutsu, dispelling itself automatically afterwards. Normally, these clones are dispatched after receiving a solid hit. Base Effect: Creates one clone. Stage Two Effect: Creates two clones. Stage Three Effect: Creates three clones. Stage Four Effect: Creates four clones.														
857	1	2	Wind Element: Wind Levitation	Fuuton: Kaze Fuuchuufuyuu	Through repeated uses of Wind Levitation, the user becomes more adept at Wind Ninjutsu overall, for this technique embodies almost all the fundamentals required to manipulate the power of the breeze. Controlling the wind, the user forces a hefty amount beneath an object with a sharp burst to cause it to 'jump' into the air. While this can be used on inanimate objects to scoop them up deftly without having to reach down, Genin tend to use this technique to boost their jump with a little extra oomph. Base Effect: The wind burst has the power to boost a jump two feet. Stage Two Effect: The wind burst has the power to boost a jump four feet. Stage Three Effect: The wind burst has the power to boost a jump six feet.														
857	1	3	Wind Element: Projectile Control Skill	Fuuton: Yadama Furooseigyo	As a rather advanced skill for Academy students, Projectile Control Skill is a technique that has evolved from merely guiding the trajectory of thrown weapons to a dual offense and defense skill. By imbuing the air around them with Chakra, circular currents of wind form about the user, carrying projectiles. While the projectiles themselves don't revolve with a terrifying speed, it can be a fearsome-looking deterrent. Furthermore, the projectiles can be thrown through releases of wind. Base Effect: The currents last for two posts. Projectiles are released with half of the user's normal throwing speed. Stage Two Effect: The currents last for three posts. Projectiles are released with three quarters of the user's normal throwing speed. Stage Three Effect: The currents last for four posts. Projectiles are released with the user's normal throwing speed.														
857	1	4	Wind Element: Retrieving Wind Technique	Fuuton: Hanpatsu Kaze no Jutsu	Creating a localized vortex of wind, the user crafts the wind to pull things towards himself. It lasts for only a second, but the vortex is so strong that it can draw whatever is untied towards the user without a problem. In terms of people and animals, though, they tend to be too strong to be pulled in by a simple gust and thus are merely thrown off balance if they are within the technique's range. Base Effect: The range of the vortex is five feet around the user, and only small objects can be pulled in. Stage Two Effect: The range of the vortex is seven feet around the user, and objects as large as a katana can be pulled in. Stage Three Effect: The range of the vortex is nine feet around the user, and objects as large as a cleaver sword can be pulled in.														
857	1	5	Wind Element: Tiny Wind Cutter	Fuuton: Chiisa Kaze Setsudanki	While initially intended for cutting apart locks, Tiny Wind Cutter has been adopted as a support offensive technique that can be used in the most clutch of moments. The user points out his index and middle finger and forms a rapid torrent of wind to circulate along the sides, creating a miniature chainsaw like effect. While this is too small to too any real damage or cut through armour plating without prolonged exposure, it is effective in tearing through skin and flesh. However, by itself it is not extremely dangerous in combat as to actually penetrate deep beyond the skin, it requires constant exposure to slowly dig into the flesh (ie. a medical patient lying still). Mere glancing blows will only inflict scratches and cuts. This technique lasts two posts before dissipating. The chainsaw extends two inches from the fingers.														
857	1	6																	
857	2	1	Wind Element: Gale Surge	Fuuton: Boufuu Kyouzuu no Jutsu	Gale Surge is the first in the line of truly offensive Wind techniques. By drawing back their hands and charging them with Chakra, when the user thrusts both hands forwards with open palms, gusts of wind will shoot forth to strike a target with sheer blunt force. The assailing torrents can be maintained for longer periods of time, depending on the skill of the user. While the power of Gale Surge is nothing to tremble at, to be caught within its direct path would feel like being punched rapidly, non-stop.. Base Effect: Can be maintained for two posts. The Strength of the barrage is equal to half the user's Power (Strength levels according to the user's rank). Stage Three Effect: Can be maintained for three posts. The Strength of the barrage is equal to thee quarters of the user's Power (Strength levels according to the user's rank). Stage Four Effect: Can be maintained for four posts. The Strength of the barrage is equal to the user's Power (Strength levels according to the user's rank).														
857	2	2	Wind Element: Wind Explosion	Fuuton: Kaze Bakuhatsu	Wind is gathered with chakra into a swirling ball that is hurled towards the opponent. The blast explodes on impact, causing minor cuts on the target's body if a direct hit. The actual force of the explosion of the Kaze Bakuhatsu feels like a punch of 10 Strength (levels according to the user's Rank). The orbs, though, can be formed in mid-air and forced to hover and swirl around the user ominously and be launched via Chakra. Base Effect: One ball can be formed. Stage Three Effect: Two balls can be formed. Stage Four Effect: Four balls can be formed.														
857	2	3	Wind Element: Deflection Blast	Fuuton: Henshin Bakuha	Deflection Blast is the exact opposite of Retrieving Wind. Instead of producing an attractive vortex, the user creates a repulsive vortex to blow things like projectiles out of the air. While people and such possess too great a bulk to actually blast away, the gust hits them with blunt force and can force them off balance for a moment if caught within range. While small projectiles can easily be blown away, larger weapons such as fuuma shuriken are simply thrown off course. Base Effect: The vortex reaches four feet with a force of 5 Strength (Strength levels according to the user's rank). Stage Three Effect: The vortex reaches six feet with a force of 10 Strength (Strength levels according to the user's rank). Stage Four Effect: The vortex reaches eight feet with a force of 15 Strength (Strength levels according to the user's rank).														
857	2	4	Wind Element: Propelling Winds	Fuuton: Okuridashi Kaze	Loosing a short blast of air from their hands, the user is able to propel themselves five feet in the opposite direction with considerable force. This jutsu is ideally suited to Wind Ninjutsu specialists who often tend to favour avoidance of attacks rather than powerful defences. This technique can be used to either move very quickly to the side, or even propel themselves into the air.														
857	2	5	Wind Replacement	Kaze Kawarimi	As an elemental version of the standard replacement technique, the Wind Replacement causes the user to burst into wind and reform from a safe distance away. The explosion of wind, while not dangerous, hits the assailant with mere blunt force. This counts towards the user's given two Kawarimi uses per thread.														
857	2	6	Open Slot																
857	3	1	Wind Element: Slashing Wind Skill	Fuuton: Kamaitachi no Jutsu	Special Requirement: A weapon of wakizashi size or larger (ideally a fan). The user uses chakra and a weapon usually to create large bursts of wind at an extent. In reality it is not an actual burst of wind but a tornado that comes from the user. The wind slashes objects; at most it can cut tree branches. Like a real tornado, the wind expands as it goes farther and hits larger targets. The wind disappears after being shot for twenty feet and at most it widens to fifteen feet. While the knockback of this technique leaves something to be desired, it holds the potential to gash the flesh of an opponent and even dispel low level enemy Ninjutsu, though it extinguishes itself as well. Base Effect: Range of ten feet, spreads five feet, and can neutralize Stage One Ninjutsu techniques. Stage Four Effect: Range of fifteen feet, spreads ten feet, and can neutralize Stage Two and lower Ninjutsu techniques. Stage Five Effect: Range of twenty feet, spreads fifteen feet, and can neutralize Stage Three and lower Ninjutsu techniques.														
857	3	2	Wind Element: Air Pocket Bursts	Fuuton: Shinkuutai Naihatsu	Focusing on the air around them, the user is capable of causing parts of the wind to 'burst' suddenly with the force of an explosive pouch, causing anything nearby to be knocked aside. While bursts can do minimal damage, their purpose is to interrupt and leave the enemy open for further attacks. However the bursts can only at spots they are able to see. Base Effect: Two bursts can be created. Stage Four Effect: Four bursts can be created. Stage Five Effect: Six bursts can be created.														
857	3	3	Wind Element: Spinning Shield of Winds	Fuuton: Bouseki Tate no Kaze	Focusing on an area in front of them, the user dispels Chakra to cause the wind to spin rapidly in a circular motion, creating something akin to a miniature tornado. Instead of deflecting attacks however the vortex, spinning at a ferocious speed, will draw in whatever is near it and hurl it back at the opponent. Several of these, placed in strategic points on the battlefield, can prove to be an effective defense. If a person were to touch one of these whirling storms, though, their skin would be rubbed raw in a matter of seconds. Each tornado only lasts two posts, and the technique has a three post cooldown. Base Effect: One tornado can be created with a suction range of three feet. It can reflect Ninjutsu up to Stage One. Stage Four Effect: Two tornadoes can be created, each with a suction range of four feet. Each can reflect Ninjutsu up to Stage Two. Stage Five Effect: Three tornadoes can be created, each with a suction range of five feet. Each can reflect Ninjutsu up to Stage Three.														
857	3	4	Wind Element: Armour of Wind	Fuuton: Kaze no Yoroi	The user utilizes his chakra and the wind around him to create a whirlwind around himself. The wind forms a six foot circle around the user. The wind picks up debris and acts as shield for the user. The Armour of Wind lasts for three posts, but if hit by an enemy Ninjutsu, it will immediately dispel afterwards. Debris and projectiles thrown towards the wind also become part of the armour. Base Effect: The Armour can shield up to Stage Two Ninjutsu. Those with a base Stamina of 10 or higher can walk through the whirling wind (not the Stamina level, but the actual value). Stage Four Effect: The Armour can shield up to Stage Three Ninjutsu. Those with a base Stamina of 13 or higher can walk through the whirling wind (not the Stamina level, but the actual value). Stage Five Effect: The Armour can shield up to Stage Four Ninjutsu. Those with a base Stamina of 16 or higher can walk through the whirling wind (not the Stamina level, but the actual value).

857	4	1	Wind Element: Wind Instantaneous Body Skill	Fuuton: Kaze Shunshin no Jutsu	An ability which allows the user to transport from one area to another in a gust of wind. The user has to have been to the area before, and be able to sense the location with his own Chakra before being able to transport himself there. This means that the distance is limited to about one mile. This jutsu can only be used to escape combat, and may not be used in the same post if the Shinobi has attacked or defended.														
857	4	2	Wind Element: Grand Slashing Wind Skill	Fuuton: Daikamaitachi no Jutsu	Requirement: Intelligence 12, Willpower 11, Tactics 10, Power 12 Special Requirement: Slashing Wind Skill A much stronger form of Kamaitachi that creates a much larger gust of wind. This jutsu, because of its severity, has the power to be both an offensive and defensive move all at once. A much larger tornado is shot forth horizontally and instead of cutting mere branches down it has the capability of ripping the greatest of trees to shreds and ripping slash marked across a victim's body. Through the teachings of the famed Temari, the Grand Slashing Wind can even be used to blow waves of Chakra and even cancel out enemy Ninjutsu, though it extinguishes itself as well. Base Effect: Range of twelve feet, spreads nine feet, and can overpower up to Stage Two Ninjutsu techniques. Stage Five Effect: Range of seventeen feet, spreads fourteen feet, and can overpower Stage Three and lower Ninjutsu techniques. Stage Six Effect: Range of twenty-two feet, spreads nineteen feet, and can overpower Stage Four and lower Ninjutsu techniques.														
857	4	3	Wind Element: Wind Dragon	Fuuton: Kaze Ryuu	Requirement: Control 14, Power 13, Reserves 11, Intelligence 10 This technique creates a dragon formed from wind. The dragon looks like a large serpent red serpent with golden claws and an icy blue mane; bulbous eyes and wood-like horns with large nostrils make up its face. It's roughly twenty feet in length and can ride easily enough on the breeze, though its size makes it a big target. Stage Three or higher Ninjutsu can fell the beast, or a physical attack of base Strength 12 (not the Strength level, but the actual value). If the user is Jounin in rank, the created dragon possesses the ability to turn nearly transparent, making it extremely difficult to see (though doujutsu such as the Byakugan would still be able to see the dragon clearly)														
857	4	4	Wind Element: Air Riding	Fuuton: Tei Hakusha	As Wind Ninjutsu is typically more focused on ranged combat rather than close combat such as what Taijutsu specialists favour, it was necessary to create a jutsu that made them as hard to hit as possible. As a result, the Wind Riding technique was created. The technique in essence has the user form a ball or board (akin to a snowboard in appearance) of rapidly swirling air beneath their feet upon which they typically sit or stand. The user is left hovering several feet above the ground, and is able to control the ball or board to move quickly in any direction, essentially allowing the user a high degree of speed and agility while they remain on the ball, and due to the hovering nature of the ball combined with its speed, it is quite natural for users of this technique to move across walls and ceilings. All of this makes this an excellent jutsu for Wind manipulators when forced into a corner, or even can be used when scouting is necessary. Air Riding lasts for three posts, and if not in combat, doubles normal movement speed; in combat, though, the boost is practically negligible since focus is elsewhere.														
857	4	5	Wind Element: Wind Skewer	Fuuton: Kaze Kushi	Wind Skewer is an excellent technique usually taught to Chuunin who are beginning to specialize in the art of hunting. By crafting the wind into several trident-like shapes, the user places his target within great danger as each wind trident can pierce like a normal one; they are comprised from enormous volumes of wind crammed into a tight space, making them even solid to the touch. Although they rarely possess killing potential 'â€œ unless someone was stabbed in the face or neck 'â€œ they can still be rather handy in a pinch. The tridents can be created in the air and launched through bursts of Chakra to shoot forwards and pin whatever is in the way 'â€œ and that is the true purpose of the jutsu: pin and capture a target to the ground. Typically the tridents are formed above the target to rain down and catch loose folds of clothing. The tridents last for two posts. Base Effect: Three tridents are formed and can be launched thirteen feet. Stage Five Effect: Five tridents are formed and can be launched fifteen feet. Stage Six Effect: Seven tridents are formed and can be launched seventeen feet.

857	5	1	Wind Element: Low Air Pressure Technique	Fuuton: Hikui Tenkuu Assaku no Jutsu	Optional Accessory: Sealing Tags This technique makes the air pressure in a room drop dramatically, causing anyone inside to fall asleep after two posts (if they remain in the room). It can only work in an enclosed area like a sealed building or isolated room. However, this can potentially be used outdoors as well due to research and development. If the user places four Sealing Tags on the ground in a square or rectangular pattern, Low Air Pressure can be applied to the space within the tags, though it requires three posts instead of two to take effect in which anybody who stays within the area will feel a significant change in the environment; they grow gradually more sluggish and tired until finally passing out.														
857	5	2	Wind Element: Wind Sword	Fuuton: Kaze no Yaiba	By channelling Chakra into his fist, when the user punches, he summons a violent gust of wind, moving so fast that if caught within the blast an enemy will suffer vicious blade like wounds from the wind slashing them so strongly. Due to its nature it is difficult to block but can be seen as a lance of rippling air and thus avoided if adroit enough. The injuries look very much like that of a sword wound, which is where the name originated. The sword can be fired a range of twelve feet before dissipating harmlessly.														
857	5	3	Wind Element: Wind Torpedo	Fuuton: Kaze Gyorai no Jutsu	The user gathers a large amount of wind into his lungs and expels it in a single blow, similar to the projectile deflection blast. This version however is significantly more devastating as the wind forms a torpedo that is near invisible that launches towards the opponent. Upon contact it explodes with a shocking amount of force. 18 Power: A torpedo explodes with the force of two explosive tags. -25 Power: A torpedo explodes with the force of three explosive tags. -32 Power: A torpedo explodes with the force of four explosive tags. 17 Control: A torpedo has a range of fifteen feet before exploding automatically. -25 Control: A torpedo has a range of nineteen feet before exploding automatically. -33 Control: A torpedo has a range of twenty-three feet before exploding automatically. 17 Reserves: One torpedo can be created. -26 Reserves: Two torpedoes can be created. -35 Reserves: Four torpedoes can be created.														
857	5	4	Wind Element: Tornado Trap	Fuuton: Tatsumaki Wana	Special Requirement: Sealing Tags By pumping a Sealing Tag full of Chakra, the user creates a trap by planting the tag in the ground or within any inanimate object. The next person to step within range of the dormant tag will then be caught within the jutsu. Released from the tag is a fierce tornado large enough to surround the enemy and keep them inside with little room to move. The opponent will find themselves trapped inside the eye of this tornado, unharmed by the winds but unable to move without touching the tornado. If they attempt to escape they will find the swirling winds will push them back inside the center, with several minor cuts and scratches due to the ferocity of the winds. However just as what's inside cannot leave what is outside cannot enter; any attacks or projectiles will simply be deflected back out. 18 Willpower: One tag can be charged and made into a trap. -25 Willpower: Two tags can be charged and made into traps. -32 Willpower: Three tags can be charged and made into traps. 17 Intelligence: The trigger range for each tag is three feet. -25 Intelligence: The trigger range for each tag is four feet. -32 Intelligence: The trigger range for each tag is five feet. 17 Tactics: Each trap, once activated, lasts for two posts with a three post cooldown. -26 Tactics: Each trap, once activated, lasts for two posts with a two post cooldown. -35 Tactics: Each trap, once activated, lasts for three posts with a two post cooldown.														
857	5	5	Wind Element: Wind Longsword	Fuuton: Kaze no Nagaiyaiba	Special Requirement: Tiny Wind Cutter This technique is initiated almost exact like Tiny Wind Cutter, but a Bird seal is tacked onto its tail end. While the principle is the same, the power level is on an entirely different level, able to shear off whole limbs and cut down enemy Ninjutsu. Even the number is increased, as with Tiny Wind Cutter only one could be formed, a Wind Longsword can be created on each hand (with the index and middle fingers) for a 'dual wield' effect. While this disables the use of other Nin and Genjutsu for the duration of the technique, its power more than compensates for that. This technique lasts for three posts with a one post cooldown. 19 Control: The chainsaw stretches two feet beyond the fingers. -26 Control: The chainsaw stretches three feet beyond the fingers. -33 Control: The chainsaw stretches four feet beyond the fingers. 19 Power: The chainsaw can cut through mundane metals in two posts. -27 Power: The chainsaw can cut through mundane metals in one post. -35 Power: The chainsaw can cut through mundane metals almost instantly. 18 Reserves: The chainsaw can cut through Ninjutsu techniques up to Stage Two. -28 Reserves: The chainsaw can cut through Ninjutsu techniques up to Stage Three. -37 Reserves: The chainsaw can cut through Ninjutsu techniques up to Stage Four.

857	6	1	Wind Element: Great Infinite Sandblast Breakthrough	Fuuton: Mugensajin Daitopa	The user inhales deeply and then exhales a vicious stream of wind more terrible than even most natural storms can conjure. Though this technique does not deal slashing and cutting damage like other Wind jutsu, it compensates with sheer force of power. Trees can eventually be uprooted and wooden shacks are torn apart in seconds; even concrete buildings can be worn down with time as bricks and chunks fly away in the wind. People are also subject to this great strength as well, able to be blown fifty feet away if they're caught widen open. If used in the desert the wind is capable of stirring up enough sand to create a huge sand storm in their area. 21 Control: The blast of wind extends twenty feet. -28 Control: The blast of wind extends twenty-five feet. -35 Control: The blast of wind extends thirty feet. 20 Power: The blast of wind can be held for two posts. -28 Power: The blast of wind can be held for three posts. -36 Power: The blast of wind can be held for four posts. 19 Reserves: A four post cooldown is required. -28 Reserves: A three post cooldown is required. -37 Reserves: A two post cooldown is required.														
857	6	2	Wind Element: Assassin's Rush	Fuuton: Kyoushu no Tosshin	Expelling a great deal of chakra, the user forces a vast amount of wind out behind them. This blast of wind has two effects, first, anything behind the user will likely be knocked over by the blast, secondly it propels the user extremely quickly in their desired direction, and the user may use the wind to make continual adjustments to their trajectory during this short dash. The dash lasts for barely a second, but in that time the user can cover considerable distance, making this an excellent assassination jutsu as the name implies. This technique requires a two post cooldown before it is able to be used again. 21 Willpower: The user can cover twenty-five feet. -28 Willpower: The user can cover thirty feet. -35 Willpower: The user can cover thirty-five feet.														
857	6	3	Wind Element: Wind Explosion Clone	Fuuton: Boufuu Bakuhatsu Bunshin no Jutsu	Special Requirement: Wind Clone Building upon the original Wind Clone technique, Wind Explosion Clone modifies the elementary jutsu to an advanced degree. First and foremost, the clone possesses the exact same statistics of its creator (with half Taijutsu bonuses). While it can't use any Nin or Genjutsu, it can mimic the user's Taijutsu perfectly and comes equipped with the suitable weapon if the style is a weapon based style. Upon receiving a single, mortal blow, the clone will abruptly explode violently with a deadly force, able to inflict serious damage to anyone caught within even the peripheral edges of the blast. 23 Control: The clone explodes with the force of three explosive tags. -30 Control: The clone explodes with the force of five explosive tags. -37 Control: The clone explodes with the force of seven explosive tags. 23 Power: The explosion has a range of ten feet. -31 Power: The explosion has a range of fifteen feet. -39 Power: The explosion has a range of twenty feet. 22 Reserves: One clone can be created. -31 Reserves: Two clones can be created. -40 Reserves: Three clones can be created.														
857	6	4	Summoning Skill: Execution Whirl	Kuchiyose: Kirikiri no Mai	Special Requirement: Grand Slashing Wind Skill, a weapon of katana size or larger, as well as a blood sacrifice. After the user wipes their own blood on their chosen weapon, they lash out viciously to release a hellish blast of wind. This is a much more intensified gust of wind that is able to chop down trees with ease and shred human beings into pieces. Within the storm of wind, a large, snow white weasel armed with a long pole, twin sickles, and a lantern take form and dance about, slashing whatever it can at random. 23 Willpower: Execution Whirl can extend up to thirty feet. -30 Willpower: Execution Whirl can extend up to thirty-five feet. -37 Willpower: Execution Whirl can extend up to forty feet. 23 Intelligence: Stage Three and lower Ninjutsu can be overpowered and nullified. -31 Intelligence: Stage Four and lower Ninjutsu can be overpowered and nullified. -39 Intelligence: Stage Five and lower Ninjutsu can be overpowered and nullified. 22 Tactics: A three post cooldown is required. -31 Tactics: A two post cooldown is required. -40 Tactics: A one post cooldown is required.														
857	6	5	Wind Element: Wind Walk	Fuuton: Kaze Sanpo	Special Requirement: Sand GM Approval There are those who can walk on walls, water, and even jump off of air, but only those elite Shinobi who learn this passive technique can truly walk on the wind itself. After initiating this technique, the user simply begins to walk upwards like climbing a hill until he reaches a desired height 'â€œ though ascending too high could be dangerous due to a lack of oxygen. However, using a technique above Stage Three or any offensive tactic will immediately cancel this jutsu, causing the user to plummet; depending on the skill of the user, he can land safely on the ground with a cushion of wind from a certain height. 26 Control: The user can walk thirty feet in the air. -33 Control: The user can walk forty feet in the air. -40 Control: The user can walk fifty feet in the air. 25 Power: The user can fall from twenty feet safely. -33 Power: The user can fall from thirty-five feet safely.

857	7	1	Wind Element: Steroid Blanks	Fuuton: Renkuudan	The user collects Chakra in his fist, summoning wind in 'blank rounds,' and then pounds the fist into his stomach, directing the Chakra through his stomach and out his mouth as six powerful blasts of swirling wind embedded with incredible amounts of chakra that can clear whole stretches of forestry. To be hit directly with one of these laundry machine sized pockets of wind wouldn't leave enough of your body to be identified.														
857	7	2	Wind Element: Cyclone Cylinder	Fuuton: Teikiatsu Enchuu	Special Requirement: Opponent permission or a death enabled thread. By holding both fists out with a few inches of space in between, the user funnels an incredible amount of wind as an extension of his arms that rotates in a tight cylindrical tube. The force of suction is amazing; anything in front of the user will eventually be drawn in and crushed to the size of a tennis ball by the sheer pressure and rotation. However, everything behind the user remains undisturbed, and it is very unwieldy and awkward for the user to try and turn around for it takes every ounce of concentration to not get sucked in himself. As such, it takes one full post for the user to turn to assail a different direction, and in that moment of turning, the suction power is greatly reduced. The cylinder is ten feet in length and two feet in diameter; Cyclone Cylinder can be maintained for three posts and afterwards depletes nearly fifty percent of the user's Chakra.														
857	7	3	Wind Element: Final Threshold of the Three Calamities of Fire, Flood and Storm	Fuuton: Sansai no Ketteiteki Shikiichi	Special Requirement: A weapon of katana size or larger When a tornado is formed it picks up debris and sometimes other elements. Using this jutsu, the user performs it like they would Grand Slashing Wind Skill, swinging his weapon confidently to stir up a breeze which picks up to become a torrential storm. The tornado hits extra (natural, non-Chakra infused) elements to take up new forms, though is not required at all. Each element and form is a calamity. Flood: If the tornado hits a body of water a massive whirlpool-like tornado is sent towards the victim. When it hits the ground or victim a large flood is sent forward that could crush or drown the victim(s) Fire: If the tornado hits a fire it would pick up the flames and still be shot forward towards the victim. The tornado would take flame qualities and a 'flaming spin-cycle' would ensue. If it hit the ground or victim an explosion would occur and a large fire would be started. Storm: If the tornado absorbs electricity or a cloud the tornado would turn grey with lightning flashes being seen in the tornado. It would be a thunder storm crossed with a tornado shot towards a victim. If the technique does not touch one of the three listed elements, it simply progresses as a normal tornado, picking up regular pieces of debris on the battlefield. The user can control the movement of the tornado but most be careful as even he can be sucked into the whirling storm. This technique lasts for two posts, continuously draining the user of Chakra until only a small amount is left (the user can only use Stage One jutsu until the end of the thread).

857	1	1	Glass Works	Hari Seisakusho	Glass is, frankly speaking, a hard element to come by in nature, putting any Glass Specialist at a severe disadvantage lest he carry around pouches of glass shards around. Glass Works was created for that specific purpose; by combining Chakra with existing sand, the sand is compressed and converted directly into shining glass. In an environment without sand, however, there is a slightly more taxing method of glass creation. The user can change the Chakra inside his body directly into molten glass, and spit it out in a stream to collect in a pile of slag that quickly cools and hardens, becoming available for use. Base Effect: Can create enough glass for Stage One and Two Glass jutsu. Stage Two Effect: Can create enough glass for Stage Three and Four Glass jutsu. Stage Three Effect: Can create enough glass for Stage Five and Six Glass jutsu. For Stage Seven techniques, the user must be within the desert. Glass Works will then convert the abundant sand in the desert into glass for the technique's execution.														
857	1	2	Shatter Panel	Katsu Kagamiita	The most elementary form of 'defense' in this arsenal of jutsu, Shater Panel is more of a pre-emptive measure rather than a barrier. A square panel of glass forms up to one meter away from the user. The square is only a quarter of an inch thick, making it ridiculously easy to break and shatter upon solid contact (ie. a punch, not a tap). However, that is the entire point of this jutsu, because once the panel shatters, fragments of glass will likely fall on the person who broke it, perfectly able of giving him/her shallow cuts. Base Effect: The panel is five feet by five feet in length and width. Stage Two Effect: The panel is six feet by six feet in length and width. Stage Three Effect: The panel is seven feet by seven feet in length and width. Something to be kept in mind is the glass is completely clear and will not reflect any light, making it nearly invisible (save for a faint outline) to all but the user.														
857	1	3	Fairy Dust	Yousei Hokori	More of a support technique than truly offensive, Fairy Dust turns a handful of sand into a fine powder of glass (or creates that handful through the second method of Glass Works). The powder can then be blown into an opponent's face to irritate their eyes and, should they breathe it in, probably aggravate their throat into a coughing fit. Shinobi have even used 'Fairy Dust' to coat their weapons, granting them a more abrasive surface while also depositing glass into their enemy's wounds.														
857	1	4	Glass Gliding	Hari Kuuchuukassou	The user forms a layer of glass beneath his feet, coating it with a small amount of Chakra to reduce the friction so that it's as if the user is skating on ice when on regular ground. What makes this a handy jutsu is that the Chakra coat softens any noise of movement from the feet, allowing for quick travel while maintaining a high level of stealth. Base Effect: The 'skates' can be maintained for five posts. Stage Two Effect: The 'skates' can be maintained for seven posts. Stage Three Effect: The 'skates' can be maintained for nine posts.

857	2	1	Glass Replacement	Hari Kawarimi	A more potent variation of the standard Replacement technique, instead of switching spots with a nearby object, the user leaves behind a glass statue of their likeness. The model shatters easily, which can leave minor gashes on an opponent who happens to get caught in the outward burst of jagged shards. This, like any other Kawarimi technique, can only be used twice per thread (by itself or in combination with another Kawarimi technique).														
857	2	2	Fragile	Wareyasui	A weapons technique that requires a sacrifice on the user's behalf, Fragile takes a weapon already in the possession of the user (if the user has disarmed and stolen an opponent's weapon, he/she must have the owner's permission) and turns it entirely into glass. While completely useless in terms of defense, the glass weapon will break into scores of pieces on its first hit. This effect has made Fragile a popular technique for use on kunai and shuriken; if the opponent were to block one of the glass projectiles, it would then shatter and spray the razor fragments onto him/her, quite possibly cutting and sticking into his skin. Once the user turns an armament into glass, though, it cannot be changed back. The process is irreversible. Base Effect: Fragile can be used on one weapon at a time. Stage Three Effect: Fragile can be used on two weapons at a time. Stage Four Effect: Fragile can be used on three weapons at a time.														
857	2	3	Glass Link	Hari Densouro	Communication is vital in a team but sometimes simple, standard issue comm. units just don't cut it. Glass Link creates a two slabs of glass small enough to fit inside a pocket comfortably. One of the two is usually given to a partner (unless the user really likes talking to himself) because the two pieces of glass can communicate with one another as well as with other communicator units. All one must do is focus Chakra into the object and think about the owner of the other slab; the matching piece begins to grow warm to signal to the partner that he is being called. The two can speak amongst one another through their frames of glass. Both visual and audio is provided, and the sound is even tunnelled via Chakra so that only the bearer of the slab can hear what the other is speaking. These have twice the range of the regular comm. unit that most Shinobi employ and last about a week before crumbling into useless pieces. Glass Links created by Jounin have thrice the range of a comm. unit.														
857	2	4	Glare Grenade	Giragira Tekidan	Flashbangs are a most useful tool within a Shinobi's equipment, but sometimes one forgets to bring them along, or simply lack the space in his inventory to pack them. Glare Grenade is a simple, but effective, substitute. By creating a single, hand-sized, blunt-edged square of glass, the user can throw it into the air and, if there is sunlight (a sunny day; overcast with limited sunshine does not suffice), the glass will reflect the rays into the opponent's eyes and blind them for a few moments, just like a flashbang. If the user is indoors or it's dark outside, he can send a pulse of Chakra into the glass to create his own glare, but this has only half the strength of a regular flashbang and thus can prove to be much less effective in practical use.														
857	2	5	Glass Caltrops	Hari Tetsubishi	Caltrops can be a deadly weapon when used strategically. By slamming both palms to the ground, the user can cause miniature glass spikes to rise an inch from the ground. These are sharp enough to actually pierce through the rubber soles of Shinobi sandals to hit the soft flesh of feet. The power of this jutsu is increased by its second effect: the spikes will drill themselves into whatever they have pierced, so it's possible that an opponent (or an ally, the effect does not discriminate between friend and foe) will find his feet riddled with glass. Base Effect: Five caltrops are created within five feet of the user. Stage Three Effect: Eight caltrops are created within five feet of the user. Stage Four Effect: Eleven caltrops are created within seven feet of the user.														
857	2	6	Open Slot																
857	3	1	Armour of Glass - Minor	Hari no Yoroi - Karui	This jutsu creates a set of most basic armour for the user. Two inch thick plates of glass adorn the user in various locations: forearms, biceps, shoulders, torso/back, thighs, and shins. This armour, though, leaves much to be desired as the weight of the glass itself can become burdensome after some time, while there are plenty of chinks between the plates to attack. Each plate can sustain... Base Effect: Level One Strength and Stage One Ninjutsu. Stage Four Effect: Level Two Strength and Stage Two Ninjutsu. Stage Five Effect: Level Three Strength and Stage Three Ninjutsu. Anything higher than those will not only punch right through the plate, but also present a danger to the user since glass shards could embed themselves in the limb they once shielded.														
857	3	2	Glitter Shot	Kirameki Tama	Glitter Shot, when employed by the right hands, can prove to be a very damaging move. The user creates several shuriken or kunai (but not a mix, only one of the two) of glass. These projectiles can either be thrown by hand or through Chakra. What puts this technique above all other minor elemental projectile jutsu is that, when under the beams of light (or by pulses of Chakra, but is less effective), the weapons will shine and flare, creating bursts of glare that make them difficult to look at and thus, harder to defend or evade. Base Effect: Two projectiles are created. Stage Four Effect: Three projectiles are created. Stage Five Effect: Four projectiles are created.														
857	3	3	Glass Torrent - Minor	Hari Honryuu - Karui	The counter part to the infamous Suna Shigure (Sand Shower), Glass Torrent - Minor creates a mass of jagged glass bits which can then be directed in a straight line at a target. The stream of shards cannot be guided or have its direction altered once started, but the torrent moves at a fairly quick speed, a decent amount of strength, and a rapidity that shouldn't be scoffed at. Base Effect: Ten fragments are created. Stage Four Effect: Twenty fragments are created. Stage Five Effect: Thirty fragments are created.														
857	3	4	Crystalline Cast	Kesshousei Seikei	After forming the required handseals, the user can spit out a stream of molten glass. Unnaturally cool to the touch, the target of the viscous material is to hit an opponent's arm or leg. From there, it will harden almost instantaneously around the limb to hamper movement. To have a hand restricted by this technique would be disastrous as it would render a target unable to properly form handseals. If affecting a leg or foot, the glass usually fuses with the ground as well to root the target to the spot. This jutsu has even been known to form makeshift casts and splints on allies. The Crystalline Cast lasts for two posts before dissipating, but can be broken prematurely by a base Strength of 12 (willing targets have no duration).

857	4	1	Glass Instantaneous Body	Hari Shunshin	Yet another variation of the famous Shunshin technique, this jutsu is exactly the same in purpose and nature, save for the appearance. Instead of disappearing in a cloud of smoke, the user's body will seem to freeze over in glass and spontaneously crack and break into pieces that are carried away in the wind. The pieces will then reform up to a mile away in any direction to a place the user has been before. This technique cannot be used in battle except to escape, and only if they haven't attacked or defended in their post.														
857	4	2	Webs of the Glass Spider	Hari Kumo no Amimono	This jutsu is the first to utilise both the burning and cooling effects of molten glass. Building up Chakra in his throat, the user will spew forth spherical globs of molten glass that are roughly the size of a softball. The spheres will travel in a straight line and, upon the user's command, burst outwards, sending tendrils to catch up any solid surface within twenty feet (otherwise the tendrils will fall harmlessly to the ground) and adhere to it by cooling quickly. What this does it make a giant 'web' of hot, molten glass; if something were to run into it, not only would they be scalded (first degree burns) by the high temperature, but the 'webbing' would then cool and fuse itself to the fabric of the victim's clothing and skin and caught as if they had run into a giant spider web. If a spherical glob hits an object, it will still burst outwards, but this time sending the extensions all around to wrap up the target and then proceed to harden. The webbing, though, will lose its strength after a set period of time... Chuunin vs Genin : Genin will be trapped for two posts. Chuunin vs Chuunin : Chuunin will be trapped for one post. Jounin vs Genin : Genin will be trapped for three posts. Jounin vs Chuunin : Chuunin will be trapped for two posts. Jounin vs Jounin : Jounin will be trapped for one post. The web can be broken earlier if the target's Strength or Power is greater than the user's Power. Also note that when under the light, the glass web will sparkle and shine, making it easy to see. In the darkness, though, it becomes exponentially more difficult to notice until it's too late.														
857	4	3	Armour of Glass - Major	Hari no Yoroi - Juuyou	Special Requirement: Armour of Glass - Minor The upgraded form of of AG - Minor, AG - Major creates a two inch layer of molten glass all over the user but does not harm him. Rather than deflect or stop attacks, the layer will simply absorb the force of the blows, which can be seen as the rest of the 'armour' will ripple. If anybody but the user were to touch it, though, they would be burned painfully (first degree). The armour can protect up to a base Strength of 18 and Ninjutsu up to Stage Two. If an opponent with a Strength greater than 18 attacks, his strike will go through the layer (but still be burned) to contact the user beyond. The main drawback of AG - Major is that the molten glass is constantly shifting, distorting not only the appearance of the user, but in his perspective, anything outside of the armour. This makes it difficult to see details of things, blurring objects together (ie. if the opponent threw five kunai together, the user would not be able to discern how many were thrown). Base Effect: The technique lasts for two posts. Stage Five Effect: The technique lasts for four posts. Stage Six Effect: The technique lasts for six posts.														
857	4	4	Hell Waters	Jigoku Suiiki	A devastating jutsu when poured on, Hell Waters requires the user to build up Chakra in his throat and mouth. Exhaling, a veritable river of molten glass will come from the user's mouth. Surging forwards for the user's Control in feet, the sluggish liquid (two feet in diameter) will scorch anything in its path, even setting things like paper and leaves on fire. Although unable to kill on first contact, if one were to be caught within the current of the molten glass and remain there, death could be a possibility, if not mutilation at the very least by second degree burns because of the immense concentration. After one post, the glass will cool and harden, setting in place and binding whatever has been caught within. This solid state can be crumbled by a base Strength of 15 or Stage Three Ninjutsu. Base Effect: This can be maintained for two consecutive posts before a one post cooldown. Stage Five Effect: This can be maintained for three consecutive posts before a two post cooldown. Stage Six Effect: This can be maintained for four posts before a two post cooldown.														
857	4	5	Anger of the Heavens	Kyuuten no Ikari	After finishing the handseals for this jutsu, large boulders of glass will rise into the air and hover, glittering in the radiant light of the sun. The user can command the boulders to fly towards a target with enough force break themselves on contact, fracturing the unfortunate victim's bones; even a glancing blow can result in vicious bruising. The boulders can be shattered into little blocks by a base Strength of 15. Base Effect: One boulder is created, roughly three feet in diameter. Stage Five Effect: Two boulders are created, roughly four feet in diameter. Stage Six Effect: Up to four boulders are created, roughly four feet in diameter.

857	5	1	Shine Wall	Koukiaru Kabe	With this jutsu, the user creates a wall of glass to protect himself. The wall is rather durable being five inches thick, standing at ten feet in height and spreading seven feet in width. The barrier can be created in any position: To the front, behind, under, even above the user, making it an extremely versatile, though stationary, defense. It would take a base Strength greater than 20 to crack and break the wall in two hits while a base Strength greater than 23 would bring it to the ground in one. Ninjutsu up to Stage Three can be repelled with ease, but one Stage Four Ninjutsu would bring the wall to destruction. A tricky ability of the barrier, though, is that with a single surge of Chakra via physical touch by the user, the side opposite to the user will produce an intense glare akin to two flashbangs. However, this expends the duration of the Shine Wall and destroys it immediately afterwards. This can only be done once per thread, no matter how many Shine Walls are created.														
857	5	2	Eternal Ice	Kagirinai Hyou	Glass has sometimes been described as 'unmelting ice', in other words, 'eternal ice', exactly from which this technique claims its name. After completing the seals and slamming a palm against a solid surface, a giant spike of glass will burst from whatever patch of that surface the user can see with his own two eyes, typically underneath an opponent. 17 Power: The spike is five feet in height. -24 Power: The spike is six feet in height. 17 Control: The spikes can only emerge from the chosen surface. -25 Control: The spikes can be created in the air and launched at will in a linear path. 16 Reserves: One spike is created. -25 Reserves: Two spikes are created.														
857	5	3	Glass Familiar	Hari Midika	Glass Familiar is a unique cloning kind of jutsu. Instead of creating a clone of the user, Glass Familiar summons forth a glass creature of nature. The beast can be no bigger than a bear in size, and no smaller than a hare. The creature possesses the full stats of the user, with two thirds of the user's Taijutsu bonuses (if the user knows a Taijutsu style). It cannot perform Genjutsu or Ninjutsu. Although unable to speak, the animal is able to communicate perfectly with its creator, but not anybody else. One solid hit will destroy the beast with ease. A user can only have one in existence at a time.

857	6	1	Fury of the Swarm	Mure no Kyouran	One of the more potent jutsu in the Glass arsenal, Fury of the Swarm has been known to end many a fight in the past. Creating ten marble sized balls of glass at the end of each fingertip, the user then fires them all at once towards the target. Keep in mind that looks are deceiving. Although they are only marble sized, each sphere is actually half a ton of glass compressed via Chakra into that one, small space. The ten orbs will then split into two each (softball size) for a total of twenty, surrounding the opponent before exploding in a shower of glass senbon. While extremely difficult to defend against, it is a difficult jutsu to pull off and is rather taxing on the user. Power 21: The Fury's area of effect is twenty feet in diameter. -Power 28: The Fury's area of effect is twenty five feet in diameter. -Power 35: The Fury's area of effect is thirty feet in diameter. Control 20: The glass senbon are exactly the same as regular Shinobi senbon. -Control 28: The glass senbon are double in diameter than regular Shinobi senbon, capable of dealing more damage. -Control 36: It is no longer glass senbon, but glass shuriken, on par with that of regular Shinobi shuriken. Reserves 19: A three post cooldown is required. -Reserves 27: A two post cooldown is required. -Reserves 38: A one post cooldown is required.														
857	6	2	Pillars of the Imperial Palace	Amatsugoten no Zanchuu	A mix between offensive and support, this jutsu creates a large pillar from a solid surface through contact. The pillars can be employed to lift the user above the battle scene and avoid an attack, or even throw themselves in front of the user as a defense. When a pillar breaks, it explodes outwards in a storm of glass shards at everybody within three meters, even the user. The pillar can sustain attacks up to and including 25 base Strength and Ninjutsu up to Stage Four. If a rushing pillar were to hit an opponent, he could sustain severe injuries amounting to broken bones and even internal bleeding. A few unfortunate victims have even been crushed to death between two oncoming pillars from opposite directions, reduced to nothing but a flat, human pancake. 17 Power: The pillars are three feet in diameter. -24 Power: The pillars are six feet in diameter. -31 Power: The pillars are nine feet in diameter. 15 Control: The pillars can stretch seven feet. -23 Control: The pillars can stretch eleven feet. -31 Control: The pillars can stretch fifteen feet. 19 Tactics: One pillar is created. -28 Tactics: Two pillars are created. -37 Tactics: Four pillars are created.														
857	6	3	Eternal Ice Explosion	Kagirinai Hyou Bakuhatsu	Requirement: Power 23, Control 23, Reserves 22, Willpower 16, Tactics 15 Special Requirement: Eternal Ice As if Eternal Ice was not dangerous enough, Eternal Ice Explosion is tenfold moreso. The user concentrates his Chakra into a palm, creating an orb of solid glass. After throwing it, wherever it lands the jutsu will take place. Five spikes now burst from wherever the ball falls, branching outwards like a horrific weed to try and impale an opponent. Each spike is massive and razor sharp with jagged protrusions so that even being scraped by a side would result in cuts and gashes. Even then, the jutsu is not over. From the five main spikes, scores of smaller spikes will shoot outwards in all directions to create a 'dome' of glass spikes, instantly stabbing anybody who has not escaped its total area of effect. The initial orbs can be created in the air and launched via Chakra instead of by hand, if the user so chooses. 23 Power: The area of effect is ten feet in all directions (even underground) from its center point. -30 Power: The area of effect is twelve feet in all directions (even underground) from its center point. -37 Power: The area of effect is fifteen feet in all directions (even underground) from its center point. 23 Control: One orb is created. -31 Control: Two orbs are created. -39 Control: Three orbs are created. 22 Reserves: Requires three posts of cooldown. -31 Reserves: Requires two posts of cooldown. -40 Reserves: Requires one post of cooldown.														
857	6	4	Fans of the Sand Goddess	Suna Megami no Tessen	Perhaps the one, personal jutsu that a former Kazekage, Arisugawa Nayoko, taught widely after she had perfected it, using this jutsu signifies a tribute to the kunoichi known as the Goddess of Sand. A glass fan reminiscent of the crystal fan Nayoko once used herself forms in air around the user, roughly three feet in length. The fan then begins to spin rapidly, so quickly that it looks like a perfect disc in the air, whirring as it does so. Through a push of Chakra, the fan then flies through the air towards the target. If it hits something, it then explodes. However, if the fan were to miss, it continues onwards for fifteen more feet and then detonates, this time sending a stream of sharp glass shards at the opponent. 16 Control: One fan is created. -23 Control: Two fans are created. -30 Control: Three fans are created. 15 Reserves: The explosion has the power of three exploding tags. -23 Reserves: The explosion has the power of five exploding tags. -31 Reserves: The explosion has the power of seven exploding tags.														
857	6	5	Molten Dragon Blast	Eikshou Ryuu Bakufuu	Perhaps one of the most feared Glass techniques in existence, this jutsu's power can rival that of Katon: Karyuu Endan. Molten Dragon Blast is capable of altering, even destroying the landscape. By concentrating a great volume of Chakra in the throat, the user then spits out a massive torrent of molten glass. The liquid is hot enough to melt human flesh, radiating enough heat in the general area for first degree burns if one wasn't careful. The giant stream surges forwards as far as fifty feet, the front waves taking the form of a dragon's head and gaping maw. Those who are caught unawares in its path are either killed by the sheer weight or the hellish temperature. In two posts, the glass eventually cools and hardens, trapping and suffocating anybody who incredibly managed to live that long after being hit. Molten Dragon Blast can only be done twice a thread. A third time could, conceivably, be executed, but would exact so much Chakra that the user would die after the third use.

857	7	1	Statues of the Imperial Palace	Amatsugoten no Juzou	Special Requirement: Opponent permission or a death enabled thread. Some say that this jutsu is done to the most terrible of traitors against Sunagakure, to show all in the village what becomes of those who turn against those of Sand. Concentrating an awesome amount of Chakra into one palm, this takes one post of preparation before its actual use where the user may not attack or defend due to the enormous focus required. The next person or object that the user strikes with that one palm will then gradually and inexorably 'freeze' over until it/he/she is nothing more than a glass monument.														
857	7	2	Meteor of Heaven	Kouten no Nagareboshi	Meteor of Heaven is a horrifying jutsu used only in the most absolute dire straits; the technique is normally forbidden because of its unrivaled pernicious potential. Sacrificing a great portion of Chakra, the user can part the skies and call down a shining meteor of glass. While falling from the stratosphere, the meteor breaks up into four house sized chunks that, when crashing to the ground, can cause tidal waves of earth so that even if one managed to evade the colossal boulder, the titanic shockwave of the impact would break bones and cause ears to bleed. Anything in a fifty foot diameter would be devastated.														
857	7	3	Glass Torrent - Major	Hari Honryuu - Juuyou	Special Requirement: Glass Torrent - Minor Much like the lesser version, GT - Major differs in that it creates actual three foot lances of glass. The lances, through hand gestures by the user - which means other jutsu cannot be used while GT - Major is in effect - can be guided and directed through the air in a stream to hound after the target. The lances can penetrate up to and including Stage Five defensive jutsu and, when the user closes his palms into fists, explode with half the force of an explosive tag. Shards of glass are sent flying in every which direction, so even the user must be extra careful not to be in proximity when this happens. The technique creates a monstrous forty lances. Note that when once lance is destroyed by a defensive or counter offensive means, it explodes as if the user had willed it. The rest of the lances can continue on, but as soon as the user chooses to detonate, all of them detonate at the same time.														
857	7	4	Celestial Garden of the Imperial King	Amatsu-ou no Tenjoukai Ensei	Special Requirement: Eternal Ice Explosion, Sand GM permission to use along with the appropriate village GM if used outside of Wind Country. This kind of jutsu has only ever been used once, ages ago, so many years past that only scrolls depict the nature of the technique. Few people know how to use it, and even fewer people have actually used it for most fear the awesome, earth-altering effect of the jutsu. Using up the majority of his Chakra, the user will slam both palms to the ground. A ripple of Chakra is sent out in all directions for a hundred and fifty feet and after a few moments, everything becomes glass. Trees, animals, buildings, everything short of Shinobi (because of their own Chakra, which retards the initial wave that was sent out by the user) is frozen within glass into an eerie tranquility. Of course, the power of this jutsu is that it blocks off an opponent's access so his own element, affecting those based on the earth most heavily. The glass itself is impenetrable and hard to walk on without slipping (though training through Kinobori/Kabenobori does help significantly). The effects of the jutsu wears off after several years; civilians caught and suspended are awoken and feel as if nothing had ever happened, never aware of the fact that they'd been imprisoned for all that time.

855	1	1	Annoying Dust Technique	Okkuu Chiri no Jutsu	Activated by blowing into a cupped palm as if holding a small pile of dirt, this simple genjutsu makes a person feel as if there was a speck of dust in their eye, irritating it. Although not damaging, it can cause the victim to lose concentration as he rubs his eyes in an attempt to get the nonexistent dust speck out.														
855	1	2	Poison Ivy Technique	Tsutaurushi no Jutsu	A genjutsu inspired by the poison ivy and oak plentiful in the forests of Earth Country, it causes the victim to feel as if he was touched by poison ivy. The target feels irritating itching over his skin. This genjutsu is triggered by physical contact between user and target.														
855	1	3	Fiction Earth Clone Technique	Itsuwari Doton Bunshin no Jutsu	Creating handseals identical to Doton Bunshin, the user holds the last one and uses it as a visual trigger. The target sees Doton Bunshin copies rise from the earth around the user, but contact with the clones proves that they are simply illusions.														
855	1	4	Rock Technique	Iwa no Jutsu	The user points at a spot on the ground, trigger the genjutsu if the opponent follows the gesture. A small rock juts from the earth at that spot, just in front of the target's foot. The target must deal with the rock, tripping over it, stumbling on it, or stepping out of the way.														
855	1	5	Mud Slip Technique	Doro Shissaku no Jutsu	Saying 'Watch your step', the user activates this genjutsu. Beneath them, the target feels as if the ground has turned to mud, causing their steps to feel slippery. While this does not force a target to fall, it makes moving too quickly dangerous for the victim.														
855	1	6	Open Slot																
855	2	1	Rotting Flesh Foul Smell Technique	Kyuukai Nikutai Oshuu no Jutsu	The user completes their seals and holds their nose as the trigger. Should the victim see the motion, they imagine the smell of rotting flesh permeating through the air. The smell is distracting and provokes nausea and, occasionally, vomiting.														
855	2	2	Approaching Allies Technique	Sekkin Kyoushoukoku no Jutsu	A snap of the fingers or a quick whistle are all that's needed to trigger this genjutsu. The opponent hears the sound and feels the chakra of approaching shinobi, presumably allies of the user. This jutsu is used as an intimidation tactic.														
855	2	3	Urine Technique	Shonben no Jutsu	The user makes a hissing noise with their mouth, the sound of water running out of a faucet. Hearing the imitation, the target's bladder seems to fill rapidly, making them uncomfortable. Attempting to relieve the pressure will reveal that the feeling is only an illusion.														
855	2	4	Gender Sudden Change Technique	Sei Kyuuten no Jutsu	At the end of the normal handseal string, the user makes a unique seal that bends their fingers to look like a large heart. Upon seeing the special seal, the target's visual perception of gender is reversed; men become women and women become men. This is distracting and disturbing more than it is actually harmful.														
855	2	5	Dirty Clothes Technique	Fuketsu Koromo no Jutsu	Scooping up a handful of dirt, the user throws it at the target. Should they watch the toss, they see the dirt suddenly expand into a cloud of dust and soil. The debris attaches to the opponent's clothes, which then become incredibly uncomfortable to wear and move around in.														
855	2	6	Open Slot																
855	3	1	Landslide Skill	Jisuberi no jutsu	When in some sort of a low altitude area, such as a valley or a canyon, the user of this skill creates a loud noise, usually as a shout or an explosive tag. The opponent then sees and hears large boulders sliding towards them at a very fast rate. This confuses and distracts the opponent as they presumably try to avoid or block the falling rocks.														
855	3	2	Dust Imitation Clone Technique	Chiri Magai Bunshin no Jutsu	Making the seals for Doton Bunshin, the user asks 'Who is it that you love?'. If the target hears the question, they see a clone rise from the ground, but it is not a standard bunshin. It is the image of someone close to them, though the user has no idea who it is. Only one such image may be active at a time.														
855	3	3	Raging Rapids of Mud	Doro no Gekiryuu	Similar to Landslide Skill, the user can cause the opponent to see and hear a huge river of mud come crashing forward at a high velocity. Activated by a vocal trigger of 'Behind you!', the genjutsu takes affect should the opponent actually look. This confuses and distracts the opponent, but contact with the mud leaves them to find that they simply pass right through it.														
855	3	4	Cliff Disguise Technique	Zeppeki Gisou no Jutsu	Only useful if both target and user are on a cliff, this is triggered by making eye contact. Once that contact is gained, the user creates a false image of a small extension around the cliff-side, giving an appearance of solid ground. The illusion has no mass and an opponent's foot will fall right through.														
855	3	5	Rock Plain Technique	Iwahara no Jutsu	As the user stomps their foot against the ground, the victim must witness the stomp. The landscape is radically altered to look like a wide open plain full of jagged rocks, though the user remains visible. This only affects sight, making the genjutsu disorienting when combined with the perceptions of reality.														
855	3	6	Open Slot																
855	4	1	Earthquake illusion skill	Jishin Genjutsu	The user performs a short row of hand seals and then slams his hands on the ground. If the opponent sees the hands on the ground, then the illusion begins. The user appears to transfer chakra into the ground, causing the ground to shake. The opponent begins to feel the shaking, attempting to throw them off balance.														
855	4	2	High altitude skill	Kousho no jutsu	Upon hearing the phrase 'Watch your step' uttered by the user, the target sees that the ground around him has fallen away. The target appears to be situated on the edge of an incredibly high cliffside and are only inches from falling to their deaths. During the genjutsu, the target feels as though they are at a much higher altitude, including a thinning of the air and a mild vertigo. Should the target step off the cliff, they find themselves safe.														
855	4	3	Bleeding Earth Technique	Gaishuukketsu Tsuchi no Jutsu	The user begins a series of seals before spreading their arms out towards the scenery. The victim sees blood begin to come out of all rocks, earth, mud etc. The blood is incredibly real to the victim, who can see, smell, and even touch the blood. The blood continues to flow, sticking everywhere, including the victim.														
855	4	4	Breath of Dirt	Hitoiki no Chiri	The user takes in a long, loud breath. As the opponent watches, they feel dirt in the air they take in rather than pure air. Thus, breathing becomes increasingly difficult as soil begins to fill the lungs and coat the trachea.														
855	4	5	Forest Destruction Technique	Kyouboku Toukai no Jutsu	Useful in wooded areas, the user finishes their seals and proceeds to attack a tree. Witnessing the strike, the target sees and hears the tree fall, which then progresses into a domino affect as the entire forest seems to come down. The confusion is compounded by the victim bumping into the actual trees which he believes to be on the ground.														
855	4	6	Open Slot																
855	5	1	Stone Body Transformation	Ishi Karada Tenka	With a point at the target's chest, this genjutsu makes the opponent feel as if their body is slowly turning into stone, from the feet on up. It takes a total of 3 posts for the victim to feel as if his entire body was turned into stone. The victim is unable to move his body, and even the breathing slows down until it is nearly gone.														
855	5	2	Dissolving Body	Tokeru no Tai	The user places their hands on their stomach to trigger this genjutsu. The victim gets to watch in horror as their body suddenly starts to turn into a bloody, acrid smelling pile of earth. They can feel their body breaking but no pain, only a simple helpless sucking feeling as their body's insides falls out from everywhere.														
855	5	3	Rock Team Technique	Iwa Senshudan no Jutsu	Starting exactly like the Stone Body Transformation jutsu, the user instead points at someone else. Should the actual victim look at the supposed victim, they see the other person turned to stone. They cannot hear the person they see turned to stone. This is most effective when a target has allies.														
855	5	4	Fissure Technique	Kiretsu no Jutsu	The user performs a short row of hand seals and then slams his hands on the ground. Then, the target, if seeing the user's hands, begins to see the ground cracking and opening up. The fissure opens up quickly and tries to swallow the opponent, who falls into the crack unless they move out of the way. Should they fall in, the fissure closes up after them and leaves them in complete darkness.

855	5	6	Open Slot																
855	6	1	World of the Dead Fissure Technique	Anoyo Kiretsu no Jutsu	The user makes the opponent see a fissure appearing in front of him as if using the standard Fissure Technique. Then, voices begin to come out of the fissure, voices of people that the opponent knows and can recognize. The voices lament their "deaths" and call out to the opponent to join them in hell. This is a genjutsu which can scare the opponent immensely, as well as distract him and psychologically hurt him.														
855	6	2	Illusion of Gravity	Genkaku no Juuryoku	After making physical contact, the user's opponent feels as if they are walking in an environment of higher G, meaning in a place which has stronger gravity than normal. Consequently, muscles are strained since the body thinks they should work harder to compensate on the higher G-force, causing fatigue.														
855	6	3	Dust Covered Sky	Chiridaruma Kuuchuu	The user begins a series of seals and holds the last one in the opponent's vision. The victim sees dust cover everything, then rise up into the air. More and more dust goes up, and begins to cover the light coming from any light source. Pretty soon, there is so much dust that it is dark and impossible to see. It can be used on multiple people, although all must be looking at the user's hand seals when activated.														
855	6	4	Deepest Part of the Earth Technique	Konrinzai no Jutsu	Running at the target, the user attempts to push them backward. Should the attack connect, the victim falls backwards into a deep pit. While the fall doesn't really hurt, they appear to be a hundred feet from the surface and in near-total darkness.														
855	6	5	Zero Gravity Technique	Mujuuryoku no Jutsu	An advanced jutsu which is the counterpart of the Genkaku no Juuryoku and starts the same way, the genjutsu causes the victim to believe gravity has disappeared. The body feels as if it is floating, which causes disorientation, lack of balance, and nausea. The target is able to see that they are not actually off the ground, but it feels as though they are.														
855	6	6	Open Slot																
855	7	1	Rock Torture Technique	Iwa Semeku no Jutsu	The user performs a powerful genjutsu on the opponent by first performing a series of seals and touching the target. The opponent suddenly feels and sees himself chained naked to a large rock. Unable to move, the opponent sees a large flock of crows and ravens come swooping down. They land on and around the opponent and beging immediately ripping out bits of flesh from the body of the opponent and eating the flesh. The user feels immense amounts of pain. This is a jutsu used primarily for torture, and it is incredibly effective.														
855	7	2	Lava Fissure Technique	Yougan Kiretsu no Jutsu	The user performs a short row of hand seals and then slams his hands on the ground. If the target sees the user's hands, the illusion continues. The target than sees a fissure opening coming towards them. But, as the fissure continues to follow the target, the traces of the fissure begin to spew lava from within the cracks. The lava creates an intense burning pain should it touch the target.														
855	7	3	Assassination Technique: Crushing Earth	Hitokiri Jutsu: Tsuuda Tsuchi	As the user performs this jutsu, they stomp the ground as a visual trigger. They then appear to absorb into the earth. The ground erupts around the victim, surrounding them and encasing them up to their neck. While this happens the victim's body slowing becomes tighter as the genjutsu tricks them that they are being slowly crushed to death making breathing nearly impossible. This leaves the victim open for being easily eliminated.														
855	7	4	World of Dust	Chiri no Ittenshikai	The user begins a series of seals and throws soil in a wide arc around them. Watching the user, the victim's vision begins to waver. Pretty soon, everything looks to be covered in dust to the victim. At the first slightest movement of the victim, the dust begins to rise up into the air, obscuring the victim's visions and clogging up their nose and mouth. Also, the victim begins to feel the dust gathering around him, enclosing him and making it difficult to move.														
855	7	5	Infinite Stone Technique	Muhen Ishi no Jutsu	An advanced and terrifying genjutsu, triggered by any physical contact, that forces the eyes of the opponent to see everything around him begin to age, except for rocks and stones. The entire world changes before their eyes at a fast rate, in which a year can pass in one real second. A decade passes in 10 seconds, and so forth. It can literally cause a person to go insane if held long enough, since to the victim the world changes at a rate that is fast and horrifying. Even if the victim doesn't go insane, he is heavily traumatized. The target's permission must be granted before using this jutsu.

854	1	1	Earth Military Movement	Doton: Tsuchi Gunjikoudou no Jutsu	This jutsu allows the user to enter the ground and "swim" in it for a limited time. However, while underground, the user may not use any other jutsu except as noted in this list. The user's time swimming starts at a base of one post and may be extended to four posts. Cooldown of one post. Base Effect: Can use for one post Stage Two: Can use for two posts Stage Three: Can use for three posts Stage Four: Can use for four posts														
854	1	2	Earth Platform Movement	Doton: Daichi Idou no Jutsu	When performing this jutsu, the shinobi places his hands on the ground and scribes a bit of his chakra into it, raising it a couple inches off the ground and effectively making it 'theirs'. What results is a square of earth, outlined in dark lines that they can use to move around on. The user is able to move around at will on his platform, but the main use of the platform is for the movement it gives. Any linear movement is possible at the user's full speed. Stage Three Effect: The platform floats up to five foot off the ground. Stage Five Effect: The platform floats up to fifteen feet off the ground.														
854	1	3	Mud Moat	Doton: Dorogou no Jutsu	This jutsu converts the area immediately surrounding the performer into a a deep murky moat full of mud. The moat is at least three feet deep and four feet in radius all around. Due to the nature of the moat, water walking alone is not very effective on it, given the slippery surface of the semi-solid earth. Only an area of 2 feet in diameter remains of solid, dry land for the user to stand on. Stacks really well with Daichi Idou no Jutsu. Base Effect: Moat is three feet deep, four foot radius. Stage Two Effect: Moat is five feet deep, six foot radius. Stage Three Effect: Moat is seven feet deep, eight foot radius. Stage Four Effect: Moat is still seven feet deep, ten foot radius.														
854	1	4	Stone Into Bread	Doton: Ishi ni Pan	A ninjutsu initially conceived for wilderness survival, the user first performs a seal and then channels chakra into a small rock or stone, one that can be held in one hand. The rock transforms into a gray, bread-like substance that can be eaten for sustenance. This jutsu provides complete nutrition, allowing a stranded shinobi to survive without real food or water. Stage Two Effect: Rocks can be transformed and reshaped into simple tools, like knives or forks, or into rough pieces of cloth for clothing and shelter. The objects can be changed back with a single seal - this doesn't work on rocks eaten for food.														
854	1	5	Third Eye	Doton: Daisan no Me	This technique creates a small, eyeball-like construct out of dirt and stone. The Third Eye is linked directly to the user's mind, allowing them to see through it like his own eyes. The eye floats and can be directed to travel away from the user, up to twenty feet away. If struck by any attack, the eye crumbles and the technique cancels. Lasts two posts. May be used during Earth Military Movement. Stage Two Effect: The eye may travel up to fifty feet away. Stage Three Effect: Two eyes are created, controlled independently. Lasts three posts.														
854	1	6	Ears on the Earth	Doton: Jitei Chikyuujuo	Descriptions: Somewhat of a misnomer, this technique allows a shinobi to sense vibrations through the earth without necessarily using his ears. By channeling chakra through the ground underfoot, the user can sense ground vibrations from up to fifty feet away, alerting them to other objects and people in the vicinity - this allows a shinobi to navigate even when blinded or in the dark. This ability is passive and may be used during Earth Military Movement. Stage Two Effect: The user's vibration sense is more finely tuned, allowing him to hear through walls by touching them. Stage Three Effect: Passive sense radius increases to within a hundred feet.														
854	2	1	Inner Decapitation	Doton: Shinjuu Zanshu no Jutsu	Usable only when underground via Earth Military Movement, the user swims towards an opponent and reaches up and out of the ground. They are able to partially affect the opponent with Earth Military Movement as long as they maintain contact, dragging an opponent down into the earth, but only to the hip at this stage. Obviously, a target may try to shake the user off during the technique's use. Stage Three Effect: May pull a target down to their necks Stage Four Effect: May pull a target down completely over their head.														
854	2	2	Mud Weights	Kajuu no Doro	Mud shoots at a target's limbs and then gets stuck, through chakra the mud is made to weigh and slow down an opponent. When used in Dorogou, it is a lot harder to dodge. Feet in particular need to be watched. Base Effect: Slows down opponent by one level of Speed Stage Three: Slows down an opponent by two levels of Speed Stage Four: Able to hinder an opponent by two levels of Speed and one level of Strength														
854	2	3	Ground Shaking	Doton: Rikujou Douyou no Jutsu	Using this technique, the user sends chakra into the ground to cause the ground to shake. The spot of the ground to affect can be controlled. The magnitude of shaking is rather minor though, only capable of slightly unbalancing the opponent. If done while the opponent is not on firm ground, it may cause him to fall. Useful for distraction as well. The shaking affects a ten-foot diameter circle. May be used during Earth Military Movement. Stage Three Effect: The shaking increases in magnitude, enough to knock down a single target, and affects a twenty-foot diameter circle. Stage Four Effect: The shaking increases in magnitude, enough to knock down everyone in range, and affects a thirty-foot diameter circle.														
854	2	4	Stone Weapon Creation	Doton: Iwabuki Souken	Widely used in situations where the user runs out of projectiles. By running their chakra through the earth or any earthen-like surface, the user is able to forge stony, jagged throwing weapons to use at their disposal. The user can launch them straight from the ground or pull them from a surface to be thrown. Base Effect: Can create small things like kunai, shuriken, senbon. Can also create small melee weapons like tanto. Up to five can be made. Stage Three: Can create larger things like fuuma shuriken, wakizashi, or spears. Up to seven can be made. Stage Four: Can create sophisticated weapons, like nets, but only one at a time. Can also create very large weapons, like oobaga or tetsubo. Up to nine simpler items can be made.														
854	2	5	Ram Head	Doton: Ohitsuji Kashira	A basic earth protection ninjutsu where a curved wall roughly the size of the creator is created. The wall is made up of a sheet of rather thick rock which generally keeps projectiles and physical attacks at bay. Given that it is such a quick technique, it only is able to handle one attack before it weakens and crumbles. Base Effect: The wall is able to block stage one ninjutsu and level two Strength before crumbling. Stage Three: Blocks stage two ninjutsu and level three Strength before crumbling. Stage Four: Blocks stage three ninjutsu and level four Strength before crumbling. Stage Five: Blocks stage four ninjutsu and level five Strength before crumbling.														
854	2	6	Stone Clone	Doton: Iwa Bunshin no Jutsu	This jutsu conjures up a single clone made out of the surrounding earth that takes the exact appearance of the user. The clones don't have much mental capacity and are able to only take simple orders from their creator. This clone has the complete physical capabilities of the user, but without bonuses and they may not use any jutsu since it has only one in every mental and chakra stat. Even so a good, solid blow will disperse it in one shot. Base Effect: Two Iwa Bunshin. Stage Three: Three Iwa Bunshin. Clones have half of the user's taijutsu bonuses. Stage Four: Five Iwa Bunshin. Clones have full user's taijutsu bonuses.														
854	3	1	Stone Needle Skin	Iwa Harikawa	The Stone-nin's body becomes entirely covered by earthen 'armor', though skin graft would be a better word here, that has the ability to spawn very sharp and durable two-inch long needles anywhere on the user's body at a whim (or all at once). The armor itself isn't very thick, but it still is highly discouraging to any taijutsu user to hit someone using this technique. Someone attacking this body covered of needles is guaranteed to hurt themselves severely. Additionally, the needles may be shot on command, spraying forward as projectiles. Base Effect: Resists level three Strength and under. Stage Four: Resists level five Strength and under. Stage Five: Resists level seven Strength and under.														
854	3	2	Earth Clone	Doton: Tsuchi Bunshin no Jutsu	This jutsu creates one single clone out of the ground. The difference from the Iwa Bunshin is that this one comes from mud instead of hard rock. Though the Earth Clone has only 1 stat in the three physical stats, it has the users complete chakra and mental stats and may use any one Doton known by the user before crumbling. Base Effect: One Bunshin. Stage Four: Two Bunshin. Stage Five: Three Bunshin that can use up to two Doton each.														
854	3	3	Dust Replacement	Doton: Funjin Kawarimi	This jutsu replaces the body with a large cloud of dust that bursts out in an obnoxious plume, briefly blinding and choking anyone within five feet of the user as the technique goes off. This obviously counts toward the number of Kawarimi uses.														
854	3	4	Mud River	Doton: Doryu Taiga	In this common Stone jutsu, the user converts part of the ground that he and his opponent are standing on into a small avalanche of mud and earth. The mud makes standing extremely difficult for the opponent even if they can water walk and will often carry them along with the quick, unbalancing current. The river covers a roughly twenty foot square. May be used during Earth Military Movement.														
854	3	5	Dust Storm	Doton: Funjin Boufuu	The user causes all the dust and dirt in a large area, about a thirty foot square, to rise up and swirl into a great storm. This dust cloud swirls rapidly and, while not dealing damage, does create excellent cover to escape or plan an attack. The great storm of dust all but forces opponents to close their eyes and start coughing from all the dust. In addition, the kicked up dirt erases all tracks in the area. May be used during Earth Military Movement. Base Effect: The storm lasts two posts. Stage Four Effect: The storm lasts three posts and scratches skin and cloth. Stage Five Effect: The storm lasts three posts and slashes skin and cloth.														
854	3	6	Stone Armor	Doton: Iwa Yoroi	A supplementary jutsu, this technique is activated through a combination of a single handseal and the user stomping the ground. Crude plates of stone then rise and coat the user's limbs, providing some additional weight behind his attacks while also slowing him down slightly. This increases the user's Strength level by two, but decreases his Speed level by two. If Speed is brought below level one, the user can only take a few steps at a time, but may still move his arms and upper body. Lasts three posts, but may be dismissed at any time. Stage Four: Plus three Strength levels, minus three Speed levels. Stage Five: Plus four Strength levels, minus four Speed levels.														
854	4	1	Sniper's Spear	Doton: Yari no Sogekihei	By lifting a piece of stone from the ground, the user fashions a long earthen spear. With a flick of the user's wrist, he can launch the spear in any direction, sending it rocketing a hundred feet before it falls back to the ground. The spear is deadly sharp and moves with astonishing speed, making it particularly effective at long range combat. Stage Five Effect: Three spears created, can be fired independently.														
854	4	2	Rock Prison	Doton: Iwa Rougoku	The user performs hand seals and then punches the earth, collecting a small mass of rubble around his fist. The next time he strikes his target, the earth springs from around his hand and entraps the target in an eggshell like piece of stone. This jutsu is useful for transporting prisoners, but only lasts for a base duration of one post. For every rank the user has over the target, the duration increases by one. Additionally, the prison can be destroyed by Stage Five ninjutsu or level six Strength. Stage Five Effect: Destroyed by Stage Six ninjutsu or level seven Strength.														
854	4	3	Rock Prism Wall	Doton: Iwa Rokkakuchuheki no Jutsu	This technique starts out with the user pulling a large rock from the ground. The user adds a significant amount of chakra to this rock and then throws it. Wherever the rock lands, a large, hexagonal prism-shaped wall rises up out of the ground that is approximately six feet in height and four feet in width, surrounding anyone inside and halting their movements. Very useful in bad situations where a good defense is needed. This wall is sturdy enough to withstand nearly any taijutsu attack. Each section of the wall can be broken by Stage Three ninjutsu. Base Effect: Four feet wide and six feet tall. Stage Five effect: Six feet wide and nine feet tall. Sections broken by Stage Four Ninjutsu. Stage Six effect: Ten feet wide and fifteen feet tall. Sections broken by Stage Five Ninjutsu.														
854	4	4	Hidden Stone Instantaneous Body Skill	Iwagakure Shunshin no Jutsu	An ability which allows the user to transport from one area to another by lowering his body to the ground and eventually become "buried" in it. The user has to have been to the area before and be able to sense the location with his own chakra before being able to transport him there. This means that the distance is limited to about one mile. When used in combat, this may only be used to completely exit a fight and may not be combined with any attacks or other defensive maneuvers in the same post.														
854	4	5	Earth Dragon Blast	Doton: Doryuudan no Jutsu	In this jutsu, a large mud and stone structure appears from the ground in the shape of a dragon's face. The dragon then shoots many earthen cannon balls which hit the enemy with great speed. Each shot breaks apart upon hitting a solid surface, but travels with enough momentum to carry a great deal of concussive force. Base Effect: Lasts 2 posts and shoots up to 4 balls per turn. Stage Five: Lasts 3 posts and shoots up to 8 balls per turn. Stage Six: Lasts 4 posts and shoots up to 12 balls per turn.														
854	4	6	Kanbotsu Ana	Doton: Sinkhole	After completing seals, the user places his hands to the ground or stomps the earth. A small shockwave resonates out from the user before the earth suddenly drops. Though not a true sinkhole, this technique instead creates a sudden crater centered around the user. At the middle of the crater, everything drops fifteen feet, and the hole covers a thirty foot radius around the user. The inside of the crater is jagged and rough, capable of scratching up targets as they fall. May be used during Earth Military Movement. Stage Five: Twenty five feet down at center, fifty foot radius crater.														
854	5	1	Mud Life Imitation	Tsuchi Seikimane	This technique creates mock life out of the surrounding mud and earth, molding it into the shape of a particular animal. The created animal cannot exceed the size of a bear and, besides being made of rubble, is just like its flesh and blood counterpart. Similar to some bunshin, these animals are sturdy and strong, having effectively level five in all physical stats. The user may create five bat-sized animals, three wolf-sized animals, or a single bear-sized animal, which all last for up to four posts and are destroyed by a single solid hit. Power 24: Level six in all physical stats. Power 31: Level seven in all physical stats. Control 23: Six bats, four wolves, or two bears. Control 30: Seven bats, five wolves, or three bears. Reserves 23: The user may see through the eyes of an animal as long as he doesn't move. Reserves 30: The user may see through the eyes of an animal at all times.														
854	5	2	Earth Dragon God Blast	Doton: Shindoryuudan no Jutsu	In this more advanced jutsu, the user slaps the ground with his open palm, causing the earth to shake. A large rock dragon peaks out of the ground and reveals its lengthy stone body before diving back under. It travels to the target through the ground, causing small tremors along the surface. When it reaches its target, the dragon shoots up out of the earth and smashes into them, then explodes on contact with the force of four explosive notes.														
854	5	3	Whirlpool	Doton: Uzumaki no Jutsu	A relatively simplistic technique with an obvious name to match. The user creates a whirlpool of earth and soil centered on himself, leaving a small patch of earth undisturbed. The whirlpool quickly twists, turns, and pulls down anything caught within it under the earth. Small objects are lost nearly instantly and the whirlpool can consume even full trees or smaller shanties with two posts. Any character caught by the whirlpool has a full post to escape the thirty foot radius before becoming stuck. May be used during Earth Military movement. Power 26: Forty foot radius. Power 33: Fifty foot radius. Control 26: Water-Walking fails while in the whirlpool. Control 33: Shunshin fails while in the whirlpool.														
854	5	4	Crushing Palm	Doton: Hasai Yashi	The user performs seals, then holds up his hand towards a target. A large hand of stone, seven feet tall, rises up out of the earth and then flies towards the target. At the same time, a second hand appears from the ground behind the target, attempting to block them in and crush the target between both stone palms. The impact is enough to break bone and cause serious internal damage, and once the hands finish their attack, they crumble away into soil.														
854	5	5	Earth Shrapnel Burst	Doton: Tsuchi Danpen Kajikeru	In this technique, the user creates what looks like multiple basketball-sized balls of earth either in his hand or along the ground. On impact, they do as much damage as they would if normally thrown or shot, but then explode, sending chunks of rock shrapnel everywhere. The explosive force isn't too dangerous on its own - the fist-sized bits of stone are the real threat.														
854	5	6	Impaling Earth	Doton: Chikyu o Tsukisasu	Casting his hand out, the user sends a ripple of chakra through the earth. Stone spikes begin to jut up from the ground, one after the other, forming a trail towards a target point within fifty feet. The spike trail can only travel in a straight line once it begins, but catches targets with a small burst of kinetic energy just before the spikes appear. This burst of force is enough to lift a human's feet off the ground just as the next spike arrives, making this technique more difficult to dodge.														
854	6	1	Mud Overturn	Doton: Doro Gaeshi	When using Mud Overturn, the user completes his seals, and then begins to manipulate nearby earth. The surface of the ground changes to mud, which can then be turned into a mudslide-like wave to overturn, crash into, or sweep away things with just a hand motion. This rolling wave of mud cancels out stage four or lower ninjutsu and can slow down stage five techniques without truly nullifying them. The mud has enough force to wash away small trees or structures and can create a fifteen-foot wide wall of mud. May be used during Earth Military Movement.														
854	6	2	Barrier Wall	Doton: Kakuheki	Putting his hands to the ground, the user causes a large stone wall to erupt from below, rising up to shield him and nearby allies from harm. This rock wall stretches twenty-feet across and is eight feet tall, capable of being curved slightly to form a shell or fit the nearby area better. The wall shrugs off most attacks and can only be destroyed by Stage Six or higher ninjutsu, or level eight or higher Strength, which causes the wall to crack and crumble. The wall remains in place for three posts. Power 30: Destroyed by level ten Strength. Power 37: Destroyed by Stage Seven ninjutsu. Control 30: Thirty feet wide. Control 37: Curves over the user, forming a half dome.														
854	6	3	Stone Artillery	Doton: Sekkai Kahou	After making seals, the user gestures with his palm upwards, lifting great stones and boulders out of the earth around him. These rocks are flung up into the sky, high enough to all but disappear from sight. On the next post, the rocks come crashing down on any point within the user's sight, seeking to crush his target. Two boulders can be launched this way at once. Power 33: Five boulders at once. Power 40: Ten boulders at once. Control 32: The boulders explode, as if containing an explosive note each. Control 39: The boulders explode, as if containing five explosive notes each.														
854	6	4	Smother Dust	Doton: Mokusatsu Funjin no Jutsu	This is a breath technique, one that expunges a large volume of dust over a thirty foot cone. However, this dust does more than simply irritate the opponent as debris flies in their face and into the mouth and nose. The dust also clings to cloth and skin, weighing opponents down and slowing their movements dramatically. This cuts all targets' Speed by three levels. Anyone reduced below level one Speed is unable to move more than a few steps at a time. This extra weight lasts for three posts, but the dust can be removed by a full post of concentrated effort.														
854	6	5	Grand Arena	Doton: Dai Kyogi-ba	This jutsu is used to shape the user's surroundings, usually to drop a large rectangular area into the earth to create a sunken, pit-like arena. When used this way, the technique creates a thirty-foot cube depression in the earth, centered around the user. Alternatively, Grand Arena can be used to sculpt a similar amount of stone into simple structures, such as huts, ramparts, or even statues. If the user chooses, the walls of Grand Arena cannot be scaled by Wall-Walking.														
854	6	6	Ambush Tactics	Doton: Machibuse Senjutsu	This technique is really a series of seals added to the beginning of any other Doton, and requires that the user be underground via Earth Military Movement. When used, it allows the second jutsu to be activated normally, regardless of the user being under the effects of Earth Military Movement. This consumes a stage six usage for Ambush Tactics, and then the normal usage for the second technique, which activates as if the user was centered on the surface of the ground directly above him. Ambush Tactics may only be used twice a thread.														
854	7	1	Jagged Forest	Doton: Gizagiza Mori no Jutsu	A technique that turns whole battlefields into nothing but a forest of jagged stone spikes. This technique is also one of which that takes a full post to start up, between the sheer amount of chakra and the amount of seals needed. However, once the second post begins, there is a small rumbling in the ground before the forest of spikes begins its rapid ascent to the sky. Each spike is twenty feet tall and tears the earth asunder until there's no stable ground for those caught by the technique to stand on. A seventy-five foot radius is utterly destroyed by the stone forest.														
854	7	2	Volcano Creation	Doton: Kazan no Sakusei	Upon using this jutsu, the earth near the user swells and breaks, forming a small hill near him. The hill splits open at the top, revealing liquid magma surrounded by the stone shell. This miniature volcano then erupts, sending lava and burning ash raining down over the battlefield. The lava is hot enough to sear through metal and lights virtually everything ablaze until it cools down after three posts. By then, anything coat by the lava is trapped in a prison of obsidian. The volcanic eruption rains down over a hundred foot radius, but not on a small circle around the user.														
854	7	3	Dust Cloud Armor	Doton: Kokufuu Yoroi no Jutsu	This technique creates of cloud of dust expunged from the user's body. Rather than cover the battlefield in dust, the cloud pulls back and wraps the user in a loose, flowing mass of dust particles. This armor renders all but the most potent of attacks nullified, protecting against stage six and below ninjutsu, but does little against taijutsu. The armor may also be used to absorb a single stage seven ninjutsu, after which the dust collapses to the ground. The mass of dust lasts for three posts, during which it can be shaped to emulate any basic, non-modified weapon costing three Item Points or less.														
854	7	4	Rock Finale	Doton: Iwa Shuukyoku	Pulling dozens of boulders from the earth, the user launches them at a target. As the rocks fly forward, they break into smaller and smaller parts in the air, creating a dense cloud of sharpened pebbles. As the parts near the ground, they explode with tremendous force. The battlefield is soon covered in rough craters from the explosions, laying waste to the landscape around the user. Each pebble has enough force to blow off a target's limb and a direct hit can be fatal on its own.

854	7	6	Open Slot																
854	8	1	Mountain Creation	Doton: Yama no Sakusei	A technique that literally changes a landscape incredibly, the user creates a small mountain, about 750 ft high. The mountain is made entirely of rock, dirt, and earth. When the mountain is created, it can totally destroy the area around it, ripping out trees and buildings from underneath. This may only be used once a thread and takes a whole post preparation, with the effects of the jutsu not fully visible until the third post. Afterward, the shinobi is so exhausted that he needs a full post to recuperate, during which he cannot use jutsu.														
853	1	1	Metal: Dagger	Metal: Dagger	The most basic offensive technique, this is usually where a student starts when learning metal ninjutsu. Using chakra, the shinobi puts metal in a state of flux, allowing them to move one of their own small projectiles through their body, under their skin. The metal then manifests as a long needle launched out of the skin or mouth as a sneak attack. Stage Two: Three needles may be fired at once. Stage Three: The user may launch ten needles or two fuuma shuriken. Stage Four: The user unleashes a swarm of twenty needles or a cluster of five fuuma shuriken.														
853	1	2	Metal: Clone	Metal: Clone	A simple technique for genin, this allows them to summon mirror images from the earth, each clone made of a hollow shell of metal. The clones are made of dull iron, giving away their ninjutsu nature. At the base level, a shinobi may summon two clones, each with a third of his normal stats without taijutsu bonuses. These clones may not use jutsu. Stage Two: Each clone is a little more tempered and may withstand two attacks. Stage Three: As above, plus another clone may be created. Stage Four: As above, plus each clone now operates at the user's full stats without taijutsu bonuses.														
853	1	3	Metal: Shield	Metal: Shield	The user summons a small metal shield out of the earth. The disc rises up quickly and floats in front of them, able to deflect projectiles and absorb taijutsu of level one strength. The shield is hastily constructed and crumbled against ninjutsu, but will float around the user for up to three posts or until it absorbs an attack over its limit. Stage Two: May block stage one ninjutsu and level two strength. Stage Three: May block stage two ninjutsu and level three strength. Stage Four: May block stage three ninjutsu and level four strength.														
853	1	4	Gold: Forge	Gold: Forge	The con artist's dream, this allows the user to create a small bit of gold, silver, or other precious metal. The gold can be shaped into coins, rings, and other trinkets, often used to broker trades with the unsuspecting. Earth Country merchants have grown wary of accepting any valuable metal from Stone shinobi, but other marks may be less savvy. However, the manufactured gold quickly deteriorates and crumbles into rust if separated from the user for longer than two posts.														
853	1	5	Metal: Whip	Metal: Whip	With a bit of careful control, the shinobi summons a long coil of fine metal chain from the earth. The chain comes to rest with one end in the user's hand, ready. From here, the chain may function as a metal whip for purposes of taijutsu, but can also be controlled to wrap around objects within ten feet of the user. This allows it to be used as a makeshift rope for climbing or to pull small objects through the air.														
853	1	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 4, Tactics 4																
853	2	1	Metal: Blade	Metal: Blade	The user draws a short sword, up to a wakizashi in size, seemingly out of their own body. The blade may be used as a sword of similar size for taijutsu, making it useful if the shinobi ends up disarmed. However, because their chakra holds the sword together, it also counts as ninjutsu, allowing it to strike through defensive jutsu. The blade may be used for three posts before it falls apart. Stage Three: Two wakizashi or a single katana may be made; created blades count as stage three ninjutsu Stage Four: Two katana or a single nodachi may be made; created blades count as stage four ninjutsu														
853	2	2	Metal: Wire	Metal: Wire	After activating this technique, the user can point to a location they can see. Metal wire winds out of the earth there and quickly sets up a simple trap, in the form of a trip wire or a web. The wires are thin and catch the light in strange ways, making them difficult to see, making it easier for them to catch an enemy off guard. Stage Three: The wires are covered in slender barbs, causing numerous small wounds wherever they touch skin. Stage Four: The wires may be set over the ground as a net trap, which springs when walked over.														
853	2	3	Metal: Shuriken	Metal: Shuriken	The user creates or draws a handful of shuriken and channels their chakra into each blade. With a flick of the rest, the shinobi can throw the weapons as normal. However, by controlling the metal in mid air, they can cause bizarre changes in flight path, allowing the shuriken to weave like snakes. They cannot round corners and must travel roughly straight from where they were thrown, but their erratic movements make them difficult to predict. Stage Three: Each shuriken can now make true turns once. They can turn up to ninety degrees in any direction. Stage Four: As above, plus the user can control each shuriken's speed, allowing him to bring them to sudden stops or accelerate them up to their original velocity.														
853	2	4	Gold: Moths	Gold: Moths	Once seals have been made, the user closes his hands together, then open them apart. In his palm are five wriggling caterpillars of shining gold. The bugs can be set down and instructed to eat, at which point they hungrily seek out any precious metals within fifty feet. The caterpillars chew away at gold, silver, and platinum, keeping the metals inside their bodies within gaining any apparent mass. Each bug can eat roughly a bar of metal per post. After three posts, the bugs hurry back to their master and then transform into much larger, motionless moth statues made of the consumed metals. This jutsu makes an effect tool for thievery, and the caterpillars can sniff out precious metals even if concealed, or worn by someone who is.														
853	2	5	Heavy Metal: Iron	Heavy Metal: Iron	Before using a Metal technique, the user may first use this jutsu, which does not count as their attack for the post, but does count as their second action. The next Metal jutsu they use is coated in heavy iron, which transfers into the enemy's bloodstream if the attack breaks the skin. For the next two posts, the target suffers from iron poisoning, feeling gripping pain in their abdomen and nausea.														
853	2	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 7, Tactics 7, Control 6																
853	3	1	Metal: Pitfall	Metal: Pitfall	A jutsu that uses the theory of doton in addition to metal manipulation, the user is able to create a hidden pitfall trap within ten feet. The pit has a five foot diameter and is only five feet deep, but the button is covered in caltrop-like spikes that can pierce through shinobi sandals and boots. The trap is initially covered by a thin layer of soil held in a disc, which breaks when stepped on. Stage Four: A number of small spikes coat the sides of the trap, causing more damage to whoever falls into it.														
853	3	2	Metal: Shape	Metal: Shape	Metal is sturdy and strong, often used to bar the way of shinobi. However, to someone versed in metal ninjutsu, even the strongest walls can be molded. The shinobi may lay hand on any metal construct, usually doors, walls, or weapons. From there, may freely reshape the metal, bending it like clay. When they remove their hand, the metal holds its new position as if it were forged that way. Up to one cubic foot of metal may be reshaped this way per post. Weapons may be reshaped into other weapons of equal or lower cost; enemy weapons may not be shaped without opponent permission.														
853	3	3	Metal: Armor	Metal: Armor	The user builds a suit of armor around themselves, covering their chest, shoulders, and hips with metal. The armor is tough, able to withstand level four strength without incident, but does not protect against ninjutsu in any special capacity. The armor will last for two posts, but may be sacrificed early to have the armor reshape itself around an incoming taijutsu strike. The metal sets as an ugly blob of iron, trapping weapons and fists. Getting free of the iron requires the prisoner's full effort for a post, but may be performed at any strength level.														
853	3	4	Gold: Coins	Gold: Coins	The user creates an innocuous handful of gold coins. However, he can launch these coins, which fly like kunai but imbed themselves in the enemy's body much further due to their thin edges, but high weight. The coins can sink fully into tree trunks and may penetrate flesh to the bone. The coins become rust after two posts.														
853	3	5	Heavy Metal: Thallium	Heavy Metal: Thallium	Like the previous Heavy Metal technique, this must be used in conjunction with a true Metal ninjutsu. Instead of covering the attack in iron, however, the user instead uses a thin layer of thallium. If it enters the enemy's bloodstream, they suffer from thallium poisoning for the next two posts. The primary symptom is nausea, but thallium also causes dizziness and delirium.														
853	3	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 10, Tactics 10, Reserves 8																
853	4	1	Metal: Spear	Metal: Spear	The user performs the necessary handseals and then slams their hand down to the ground. The earth beneath him rumbles, and then a cluster of three foot long metal spears emerge from within twenty feet of the user, pointed towards an enemy. The cluster of spears appear in a five-foot diameter circle with enough force to cause serious harm. Stage Five: The spears cover a ten-foot diameter circle or appear in two five-foot circles.														
853	4	2	Metal: Shrapnel	Metal: Shrapnel	The user claps their hands together and focuses their chakra into the earth, conjuring a number of small pieces of metal. Each piece of metal is jagged and sharp, rising from the ground to float around the user in a menacing cloud. The shrapnel can be spun, covering a five foot radius around the user with dangerous spinning blades. The cloud is not dense enough to obscure the user, nor does it distinguish between friend foe, covering anything that falls into range with gashes. The cloud lasts for a maximum of three posts, but the user may not use any other offensive jutsu as long as the cloud is maintained.														
853	4	3	Metal: Bolt	Metal: Bolt	Metal is shaped into a large arrow or crossbow bolt, a foot long, which then hovers over the user's hand. With a thought, the bolt may be launched as though fired from an invisible bow. The bolt travels quickly and quietly, revealing its true nature only inches before impact. As the bolt nears, it suddenly splits apart, its front half branching into three identical arrow heads. The bolt can thus triple its damage output. The arrow can fly up to forty feet.														
853	4	4	Gold: God's Hand	Gold: God's Hand	Gold is pulled from the earth and rapidly multiplies, shaped into a massive hand, like that of a great statue. The hand is five feet long from the wrist to its furthest finger tip. It has a singular purpose, which it executes immediately. The hand is capable of flying up to twenty feet away and then neatly falls over to the ground. It weighs several hundred pounds, smashing through weaker objects, causing crushing damage to anyone it catches, and pinning the weak under its bulk. Level five strength can lift the hand and stage four ninjutsu can damage it enough to escape it. Otherwise, the hand rests on the ground for two posts, immobile, then blows into the wind as metal dust.														
853	4	5	Heavy Metal: Lead	Heavy Metal: Lead	Performed like other Heavy Metal techs, this one coats another jutsu in blue-grey lead. Upon entering the bloodstream, the enemy is greeted with a powerful metallic taste in their mouth, alerting them that something is wrong. Indeed, soon thereafter, the enemy begins to suffer from a headache as well as joint and muscle pain. While the pain is constant, it is not outright debilitating. The lead poisoning lasts for three posts, gradually increasing in intensity before fading once the duration is over.

853	5	1	Metal: Shelter	Metal: Shelter	The user creates a half dome of metal overhead, covering roughly a ten-foot diameter in its shadow. The dome rotates slowly in the air and provides a sturdy defense against incoming attacks, able to provide eponymous shelter to the user and his allies. It deflects ninjutsu up to stage four and, if lowered to further to the ground, absorbs the force behind level four strength and lower taijutsu strikes. Any stronger attacks crack the dome and then pass through it. Power 24: Deflects ninjutsu up to stage five and taijutsu to level five strength. Counts as a stage six jutsu usage. Power 31: Deflects ninjutsu up to stage six and taijutsu to level six strength. Counts as a stage seven jutsu usage.														
853	5	2	Metal: Dancing Sword	Metal: Dancing Sword	The user summons three weapons from the earth, any combination of katana, battle axes, spears, or naginata. Each weapon is made entirely of glimmering metal and hovers in the air near the user. The weapons can be directed to attack targets within fifty feet of the user, flying forward and taking up positions as if held by invisible warriors. The weapons fight of their own accord, as if wielded under the user's own strength and skill with each. The user must maintain concentration while the weapons fight, keeping them from using other jutsu or attack on their own. The weapons fight for up to two posts, then fall to the ground and crumble. Due to their rapid construction, the weapons break of they are hit by attacks. Intelligence 24: Up to five weapons may be made and controlled. Intelligence 31: Up to seven weapons may be made and controlled.														
853	5	3	Metal: Saw	Metal: Saw	The earth below the user rumbles and breaks as a massive, spinning saw blade tears its way up into the air. The circular blade is six feet across and its edge is covered in razor teeth. The user places their palms flat on either side of the blade and spins once, like throwing shotput or a discus, then releases the saw. The blade's weight lets it only fly twenty feet before diving to the ground, but it rotates with such speed that it passes easily through trees and people.														
853	5	4	Gold: Dragon Spear	Gold: Dragon Spear	A dragon's head, posed with mouth open and eyes blazing, erupts from the ground at an angle. The force of the blow alone is enough to stagger most targets. However, its brass eyes shine and then the gold melts, still carrying the momentum of its arrival. Molten gold falls over ten foot circle like burning rain, eating through cloth and searing through flesh. Wherever the gold falls, its hardens, weighing down targets unfortunate enough to take the full brunt of the assault. After two posts, the hardened gold vanishes.														
853	5	5	Heavy Metal: Arsenic	Heavy Metal: Arsenic	An insidious technique that coats another jutsu in the metalloid arsenic. On the first post after entering the bloodstream, an affected enemy begins to feel both delirious and drowsy, hampering their combat ability. On the second post, the throat tightens and contracts. An afflicted target is partially suffocated, unable to draw enough breathe to speak or exert themselves. The effects of arsenic poisoning fade on the third post.														
853	5	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 19, Tactics 19, Willpower 18, Power 16																
853	6	1	Metal: Hail	Metal: Hail	Steam of liquid metal shoot out of the ground behind the user, each one taking the shape of a weapon roughly the same size as a katana. The user can create a swarm of fifteen such armaments, which then level their tips towards a targeted foe. With a hand motion, the shinobi sends the blades forward in a barrage. The blades can slash through stone and easily slice foes apart; anyone who stands under the rain without a powerful defense is taunting death. Power 28: The shinobi can create twenty weapons. Power 35: The shinobi can create thirty weapons.														
853	6	2	Metal: Axe	Metal: Axe	The user stomps their foot against the ground, summoning forth a colossal axe. The curved blade of the axe is about four feet long with the entire weapon roughly ten feet tall and made of solid metal. The user directs the weapon manually, holding it in their hands through weak chakra bonds and swinging it easily, able to ignore its great weight. The axe lasts as long as the user continues to keep it in hand and can cleave through stone, making it a solid choice as a demolition tool.														
853	6	3	Metal: Extraction	Metal: Extraction	A horrifying jutsu, the user first completes the seals and then must make physical contact with their target. Their chakra invades the enemy's body and infests the traces of metal that exist in all living things. The metal can be gathered together and ripped from a target's body. Small needles of iron rip out of the target's arteries and through their skin. Beyond the full body damage, the sudden drop in blood iron levels causes anemia, complete with fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations. The user must make contact with an enemy for a full post and may not combine this technique with any form of Heavy Metal.														
853	6	4	Gold: Lucky Cat	Gold: Lucky Cat	Throwing a coin or other source of gold over an enemy's head, the user causes the metal to propagate and form into an eight foot tall statue, often a lucky cat. The statue, of course, immediately crashes down to earth from a height of up to twenty feet, its weight enough to cause serious damage on its own. Shortly after impact, against a body or against the ground, the statue explodes into a shower of coins that pierce skin like shrapnel out of a fragmentation grenade. Though the statue 'explodes' it does not let out any heat or kinetic force besides what is carried in the coins. The duplicated coins disappear in puffs of smoke after two posts.														
853	6	5	Heavy Metal: Magnesium	Heavy Metal: Magnesium	This technique is slightly different than other Heavy Metal jutsu, as it simply coats another jutsu in a layer of special chakra rather than in an additional metal. However, this chakra is able to enter an enemy's bloodstream and pull the magnesium together, rendering it unusable by the body. This acute hypomagnesemia causes three posts of weakness, arrhythmia, and tremors. In addition, from the second post on the afflicted target experiences mild hallucinations. After the third post, the gathered magnesium is released back into the bloodstream and the enemy recovers.

853	7	1	Metal: Giant	Metal: Giant	The user lifts their hands towards the heavens, causing the earth to split beneath them. Behind them, a great steel monstrosity rises partway out of the ground. The exact look can be changed by the user, but the exposed part of the colossus is fifteen feet tall, trapped at the waist. Its two arms are gigantic and can be ordered by the user to smash, grab, and hold. The giant slides through the ground at surprising speed as if using the Earth Military Movement doton, its legs never breaching the surface. It fights for the user for three posts, is impervious to enemy ninjutsu below stage seven, and has enough strength to bend steel.														
853	7	2	Metal: City	Metal: City	A truly wondrous technique, this jutsu requires a full post of concentration by the user. On the next post, the earth rumbles and shakes as steel beams and sheets push out of the soil and begin to arrange themselves according to the user's whims. The user can quickly create elaborate metal structures, from houses to bunkers and so on. He may create a single building per post, up to three floors of a hundred square feet each. As long as the user maintains concentration, they may continue to build. In combat, this may not be used to trap opponents in boxes and crush them between walls anything they build must accommodate humans in the vicinity. Trees and other structures are pushes aside by the emerging metal to the edge of the user's field of control.														
853	7	3	Metal: Molten Spray	Metal: Molten Spray	Pooling chakra in their throat, the user exhales. With their breathe comes a torrent of molten, liquid metal that widens into a twenty foot wide wave. The metal rolls forward in a pool until it extends a hundred feet away from the user. The metal is hot, burning anyone it catches and clinging to them with its weight. On the second post, the user can activate an additional seal, forcing the metal to instantly cool and become solid, shining steel. Anything under or within the pool of metal is trapped there.														
853	7	4	Gold: Transmutation	Gold: Transmutation	The user holds immense chakra in their palm and finger tips of one hand and thereafter needs to simply touch an enemy for a moment. Once contact has been made, the enemy's body begins to turn to solid gold. Flesh, bone, and blood all transform into the base element, becoming heavy and useless. The transformation spreads like a blight over the body, able to consume a limb per post. If the affected area is amputated, it will not spread to the rest of the body. Otherwise, the target becomes a statue after three posts, then crumbles to rust as the gold degrades. Stage seven medical may halt the transformation, but not reverse it.														
853	7	5	Heavy Metal: Mercury	Heavy Metal: Mercury	Concentrating an enormous amount of chakra, the user can transform a different Metal jutsu to be composed entirely of mercury. The liquid metal swirls into the right shape for the second jutsu, adopting hardness, weight, and sharpness as necessary. If it breaks the enemy's skin, however, the mercury will pull itself into the target's blood and disperse through their body. The sudden influx of massive amounts of mercury poisons the target, causing full body pain, muscle weakness, rash, and a severe sensitivity to light. Mercury can further cause kidney failure and tachycardia. These effects do not fade with time and the afflicted must seek medical attention to treat the poison.

852	1	1	Stone Force Jewels		DOESNT FIT IN A SPREADSHEET														
851	1	1	Your sword's name here	Kon-konpon -	(Soul Root) Jutsu This jutsu is required by all clan members who plan to summon their soul armor. This jutsu is noted by a tattoo somewhere on their face, which glows whenever a piece of armor is summoned. Note: This technique does nothing itself and is not an actual jutsu to be used. Under this technique should be a summary of the abilities of each piece of the Konyoroi.														
851	1	2	Summon Blade	Seisei-ken	Jutsu The original summon, this is usually just considered an ability to return the Konken to its owner. Where ever the weapon currently is it seems to turn a bright white (though not enough to harm the eyes) then it phases out of existence and then phases back into existence in the owner's hands.														
851	1	3	Soul Lock	Konjoumae	Jutsu This jutsu is not even on the level where it needs hand seals, being a simple use of chakra and a basic utility of clan weapons. This technique removes the worry that one will get themselves into a situation where they cannot use their hands for seals in an emergency situation. When a blade is dropped, it can be made to hover where it is, staying locked in place. If struck by any outside force the blade will simply fall to the ground or be thrown with the force of impact.														
851	1	4	Cleanest Steel technique	Seijou Kane no jutsu	Jutsu Clan weapons are some of the finest crafted in the world, and it shows through this technique. Using a miniscule amount of chakra after few handseals, any solid surface of Konken will become as reflective as a mirror. Even through dirt and grime, the mirror like effect will shine through as long as chakra is channeled into it.														
851	1	5	Neophyte's Spark	Shinjin no Hibana	Jutsu After hand seals, the next time the edge of the soul weapon strikes a surface, the spark of iron against hot iron is created. The simple spark cause a mild sting if the erupting sparks touch skin. It can also cause highly flammable substances to catch aflame.														
851	1	6	Open Slot																
851	2	1	Finest Shine	Migakiageru	Jutsu This jutsu is a low level distraction technique. After completing their seals, the clan member's soul weapon will begin to glow like the hottest metal. Then bright sparks erupt from it, making it shine bright enough to temporarily blind someone for one post and leave spots in vision the following post.														
851	2	2	Summon Gauntlets	Seisei-tebukuro	Jutsu Commonly the Konyoroi piece discovered, these defensive armaments are common because of how light weight they are and their ease of use when still using offensive styles. After the hand seals are finished, the user holds their hands high (holding up their soul weapon) and in a strike of bright light the Soul gauntlets appear over their hands. Soul gauntlets commonly absorb damage just like a normal pair of gauntlets. After taking a direct blow, these gauntlets disappear again in a flash of white light.														
851	2	3	Twirling Steel Technique	Nenten Kane no Jutsu	Jutsu Using the basics of the soul lock, the soul weapon can now be used in this defensive jutsu. After or before seals, the weapon is locked into place right before the user. Afterwards the weapon begins to spin along its center very quickly, creating a basic defense against projectiles and attacks of 10 strength or less (without Tai bonuses).														
851	2	4	Faux Soul	Gonsakukon	Jutsu A replacement technique that replaces the clan member with their current Konyoroi. This requires that they at least be wearing one piece of soul armor. Instead of being hit by the blow, only the soul armor of the user will be in their place, and their body will combust into a blinding white light. Afterwards the armor that they were wearing at the time will vanish with the light. (Blinds for 1 post) (Kawarimi rule applies. Only useable twice per thread)														
851	2	5	Blast of the furnace Technique	BakuhaKame no jutsu	Jutsu This jutsu creates a passive increase in temperature local to the Konkaji. To an observer it seems like flits of sparks are hanging in the air around them. To anyone within a 20 foot radius, they will feel an almost dramatic rise in temperature, causing prolonged physical activity to quickly tire out anyone that doesn't have a good way of keeping cool. Coincidently, the user is the only one who doesn't feel the effects from this. Base Effect: Last 2 post Stage 3: Last 3 post Stage 4: Last 4 post														
851	2	6	Open Slot																
851	3	1	Unexpected Visit Technique	Ikkyou Sankan no Jutsu	Jutsu Calling on the help of the Ethereal Konken of the dead, the user performs a quick set of hand seals to initiate this jutsu. Upon the completion of the hand seals a grouping of miniature swords and spears collect around the user's head and then at a motion are launched towards the target. The weapons are no bigger then kunai in their actual penetrating ability and vanish after striking a solid surface. Base Effect: 2 Weapons created Stage 4: 4 Weapons created Stage 5: 6 Weapons created														
851	3	2	Summon Boots	Seisei-Hanka	Jutsu The boots of the Konyoroi are summoned into being with this technique. After the hand seals are completed the user raises their Konken high and a bright light shines around their ankles, followed by their boots appearing over the garment currently covering their feet. These boots are just as resilient as your average armored footwear, and when struck with a solid blow or punctured, they will vanish in a bright white light.														
851	3	3	Shadow Puppet	Kagesentou	Jutsu Another extension from the soul lock ability, this time allowing the user to move their soul weapon around the battlefield with a manipulation of chakra. The weapon moves at a speed equal to the user's control, and if the user moves their arms as if fighting the weapon will make the same motions. The limits on this are that one hand has to maintain a seal for the duration, and 'letting go' of the weapon will release the connection.														
851	3	4	Strike it hot!	Kencho Atsui!	Jutsu A technique based purely in chakra manipulation, the user completes one seal and then their Konken begins to glow. After this the next time their weapon strikes a surface, there is an explosion the force of an explosive pouch accompanied by a bright white explosion and sparks. This is dangerous to be hit by, but can also be used to force objects open.														
851	3	5	Welder's knife	Yousetsutou	Jutsu This jutsu turns the users Konken into an exact item of destruction. The weapon begins to glow bright orange with heat, and unlike usual is actually becoming extremely hot in the user's hands. The surface becomes hot enough to cut through metals with some resistance, and things like stone or trees are easily seared through. Usually this is more useful for gaining entry into locked places, like a safe or a vault, but can be used to punish an opponent with strong burns if they manage to be struck. This jutsu only last the post it is used.														
851	3	6	Open Slot																
851	4	1	Heart seeker's weapon	Kokoro Tankyuu no Buki	Jutsu After throwing the soul weapon like a boomerang, the user creates the tiger seal. This makes the weapon begin to spin violently upon its center-axis, creating enough spinning force to drill into stone if needed. But what's worse is the weapon moves under the user's direction at a speed equal to their control. This continues for 3 post, as long as the user holds the tiger seal for the duration. If the weapon strikes a target it hits with force equal to twice the user's power, and has been known to penetrate stage 3 jutsu and below with ease. At the end of the last post, the weapon returns to the user's hand.														
851	4	2	Summon Helmet	Seisei-Shappo	Jutsu The fourth soul armor piece is considered less vital, but more utilitarian then the others. Raising their soul weapon high above their head, a bright light shines over their face before it is covered in their personal soul armor piece. These helmets usually have the common durability of a normal helmet, and after being struck by a solid blow or punctured in any way will disappear in a bright flash of light.														
851	4	3	Meeting of the ancestors	Senkun no Issho	Jutsu A purely defensive jutsu. After hand seals are completed, a mass of swords that appear to be made of light converge right before the user. This convergence of swords has a 3 foot diameter. It will block up to stage 3 jutsu. A physical attack can break the shield of swords if the attacker's strength (without bonuses) is higher then the user's power. The Meeting of the Ancestors stays where it is summoned for 1 additional post after the one it is created.														
851	4	4	Rain of the blackened	Kokujin no Ame	Jutsu A blacksmith ready to heat metal must have a good source of heat. This jutsu is initiated by the clan member performing seals and then pointing their weapon to the sky. Suddenly from above there starts a slow rain of sparks, as if standing under a blacksmith's anvil. These sparks are enough to causing singing stings hit direct skin, and cause burns to clothing. The rain continues over a 15 meter area, and is known to cause mild devastation to the nearby area. But most of all, it causes a constant level of stinging heat.

851	5	1	Thunderous Release	Gougoukai	Jutsu This technique requires a large concentration of chakra for a long distance strike. After seals are completed, the user charges chakra into their Konken for a whole post, which causes it to glow bright orange like heated iron. The second post the weapon is then pointed, and then explodes off in the direction pointed with a noise resembling cannon fire in volume. The weapon then travels up to 90 meters with the force of a blow with strength equal to the 35 strength and penetrates stage 5 defensive ninjutsu and below. The force of the landing has been known to leave small craters for stronger ninjutsu users and the attack is said to travel at a speed rivaling even the greatest projectile specialist's throws.														
851	5	2	Summon Chest piece	Seisei-Bugu	Jutsu The strongest and most detailed piece of armor, this chest piece is summoned by the user initiating the jutsu and then raising their soul weapon high above their head. Their whole chest glows in a bright white light before their armor appears in place of their current clothing. Being more resilient then all the other armor pieces, the basics of the chest piece allows it to take two sturdy blows or be punctured twice before it disappears in a flash of white light.														
851	5	3	Arsenal of the unforgotten	Wasurejin-nai no Heikei	Jutsu The dead give their weapons as gifts to the clansmen's cause. After handseals are completed for this jutsu, the very earth begins to rumble beneath the battleground and a pattern of white spots checkers the ground every 2 feet. Suddenly, in the area of 10 meters, Spears, long swords, and halberds rise up across the ground from the spots to strike up to 5 feet in the air. These weapons rise fast enough to impale anyone unlucky enough to be standing on them, yet always come straight up from the earth (never at an angle). These weapons are stuck in place, unable to be removed from the earth. After the jutsu is completed, the weapons remain protruding from the earth, dotting the battlefield and restricting movement as people struggle to find room between them to move.														
851	5	4	Under the Hammer	Dzuki-Kanadzuchi	Jutsu After performing the seals, the user strikes their Konken into the ground (or any solid surface). After it's landing, the ground (or a place along that surface) under a specific place within 10 meters of the user will begin to glow bright white. The user must keep their weapon in place till the explosion is set off. This slow and obvious build up leads to an explosion of sparks equal to a weaker explosive tag going off under the intended location. Not only devastating, but also blinds anyone that witnesses the explosion for 1 post, and causes 1st degree burns by those hit by the sparks that the explosion spreads wide along the battlefield.

851	6	1	Clone: Armor Possession	Bunshin: Yoroi Ryoudo no Jutsu	Jutsu This technique is considered top tier among fighting bunshin. After performing handseals, the User's armor glows and then vanishes from their body, then reappears on a bunshin whose body seems to glow a fluctuating orange. It carries a duplicate of the User's sword, even down to its functions, and each piece of armor the user currently had on works as it would for the clan member themselves. The clone's stats are equal to the users with no tai bonuses. It can use any jutsu it has the stats for in this list except for jutsu to resummon armor pieces or create more bunshin and has the same stage of taijutsu (with S.techs) as the user. After the bunshin is defeated, the armor dissipates with a white glow. Only one bunshin at a time can be created.														
851	6	2	Summon Complete Soul Armor	Seisei-Yoroikonzen	Jutsu By this point clan members have learned to summon multiple pieces of armor at once. This jutsu summons all the pieces of soul armor that the user knows jutsu for all at once, as well as intricately connects them to create a more complete suit (through other smaller pieces of armor like Chausses, greaves, etc, that cover up the small areas of the body that may have still been exposed when separate pieces were summoned. The clan member performs the seals and raises their hand high above their head; they then glow white all over before the armor appears to cover their body. The downside to this way of summoning the armor is that after any armor piece is struck or punctured twice, the whole suit of armor will vanish in a bright light.														
851	6	3	Gift of the Lost	Atae Maigo no Jutsu	Jutsu A strong defensive jutsu. This technique creates an aura of chakra on the exterior of the Soul Armor. For 1 post the user is immune to jutsu with a stage lower then Stage 2 plus an additional stage for every Konyoroi piece they currently have on. The Konken weapon does not count. When this jutsu expires, the soul armor is unsummoned except for the soul sword, and no pieces can be summoned for 2 post. The user is free to move while this protection is active.														
851	6	4	Favor from the Heavens	Hogo Tentou wa Yori	Jutsu The user performs this jutsu while their sword is in soul lock. Afterwards their sword soars high into the sky, then soars back down and strikes the earth, causing the earth to groan with the blow. The very earth below the weapon's landing is depressed and everyone in the area feels the tremor. Most people are easily thrown off their feet by the shaking. The earth splits slightly in a line towards up to 4 targets, and from it seems to explode up sparks that cause 2nd degree burns.

851	7	1	Iron Shaper!	Tetsu Kakkou!	Jutsu Using the power of a complete soul armor, this jutsu creates a devastating attack that can level large areas of battlefield in one shot. After summoning their full soul armor, the user's armor and weapon begin to glow brightly with a blinding aura. A mass of chakra is being expended throughout the armor, charging it for the strike to happen. Then the user moves towards their target, the armor feeling lighter then life, making movement easy and effortless, no physical force can stop the user's movement during this time and they will find themselves having trouble even stopping themselves. They are immune to physical attacks from attackers whose Strength + Stamina (Without Tai) is less then their Power + Control and any jutsu below stage 7. If they strike something within that post, their weapon will explode with the force of several exploding tags, cutting through any defense lower then stage 7, and blinding those that witness the technique for 2 post. After the post this is used, regardless of the blow landing or not, the soul armor vanishes and the user will find themselves drained of nearly all their chakra, if they don't pass out that is. This jutsu may only be used once per thread. Require opponent's permission.														
851	7	2	Curse of the 8 smithies	Hatsu akuba no Kokujin	Jutsu one of the final jutsu of the clan, created to end engagements regardless of the dexterity of the target. It requires physical contact, and more then that to create a capturing grip on the target. After the jutsu is initiated, 8 glowing red ethereal blades appear around the user, circling them in a slow pattern. These swords will circle the user for 3 post, or until the jutsu is executed. Once the user gets a firm grip on their target, 9 ethereal blue bunshin appear, each one taking a blade and the final one merely watching. The 8 armed bunshin each sweep in, one after another, and jam their weapons deep into the target. These weapons do not harm armor, clothing, or even outer skin, but attack directly to the core of the body, destroying the inner organs in horrible slashes and penetrations. The final blow will come from behind the user harmlessly passing through the user and going right through the target's heart. This jutsu is almost always a sure kill. Afterwards, all the weapons and bunshin vanish. Opponent's permission required.														
851	7	3	Final Wishes	Shuukyoku-Sachi	Jutsu This mass damage technique is the finishing move for more battle royal situations. After completing the needed hand seals, a mass of ethereal weapons appear above the user's head, each one glowing a faint orange in color. At the user's command they shoot off at up to 4 targets, divided however the user chooses, each one moving of its own will and with frightening speed. Worse than this, they fly with intent, and will track a target for 1 whole post before giving up. For each blade that strikes a target, they explode with the force of an exploding pouch. One weapon is created for every 4 control. The weapons fly at a speed equal to the 40.

851	8	1	The 9th Blade	Kyuken	Jutsu This mysterious jutsu is said to only have been performed by the eldest member of the clan, and former clan head. After the beginning of the Curse of the 8 Smithies technique, when the weapons are still circling the user, they go into another long set of seals. When they are finally complete, the sky goes black with clouds, and a single solid blade of gold luster falls from the sky and strikes deep into the earth. Moments later, an earth splitting quake, strong enough to level massive buildings and change the face of mountains, will hit within a mile area. The devastation is so terrible that it is said that only the user will know the way to survive it, which holds true with the eldest member still being alive today.														
850	1	1	Forced Sleep	Forced Sleep	All the members of the Shunmin clan are able to force their bodies to go into a stage of sleep. Sleeping doesn't hamper the Shunmin in combat but to the contrary helps him travel inside of his mind and extract all his wildest imaginings. It is self-induced, meaning the user can choose to break out of the jutsu whenever he wishes. This jutsu is a mandatory requirement to use the other jutsu in this list, and can be cast as many times as possible. Duration: 1,3,6 Note: can only be used on the user.														
850	1	2	Mind Weapon	Mind Weapon	As strange as it may sound, the Shunmin are able to summon a weapon from their dreams. Generally, the look and feel of the weapon varies from person to person, meaning no Shunmin has the same weapon. It could be a staff, a sword, or something that doesn't even make sense to someone in the real world. The mind weapon feels real to the opponent and he feels compelled to try to avoid hits from it,. However, getting hit from the mind weapon would result in no harm. For now, this weapon is virtually harmless, but is required for higher abilities. Duration: 1,3,6														
850	1	3	Imaginary Friend	Imaginary Friend	The Shunmin are able to summon what seems to be a companion. Some choose to summon a small animal, some choose a human, and some even make the strangest things that one could imagine. It doesn't matter what your imaginary friend looks like as it is mostly used to converse with. The companion is limited to a distance of 10 feet from his user. Duration: 1,3,6														
850	1	4	Dreamy Transformation	Dreamy Transformation	The Shunmin can choose to change their appearance to look like anything that can they dream of. One might look like a charming prince from a distant land, one might turn into a half-animal, some even cross-dress. Essentially, it doesn't matter what they turn into as long as the Shunmin stays a somewhat human size. This jutsu doesn't grant any special abilities and is mostly used in the Shunmin inner circle and at parties. Henge is much more useful and reliable than this jutsu, but it could have its uses in the battlefield if one were to transform into a bush to hide amongst the flora. Duration: 1,3,6

850	2	1	Paprika	Paprika	The Shunmin are able to modify the battlefield to closely look like either their dreams or nightmares. The place could be gloomy or full of toys and the like. The battlefield is masked from sight perfectly. A pretty useful jutsu overall for creating confusion or losing an opponent. Duration: 1, 3, 5														
850	2	2	Deja Vu	Deja Vu	The opponent, while trying to attack the Shunmin, will have the impression that he has successfully landed a hit. However, the illusion is much more subtle than that. The genjutsu takes effect in the mind of opponent before he has even had the chance to physically act. Meaning the action occurs in the subject's mind but nothing actually happens in reality. This jutsu is useful for the Shunmin to prepare an attack while the opponent is distracted, as the illusory action will be seen over and over again in the opponent's mind. Generally, most realize that something is up. Duration: 1,3,5														
850	2	3	Beetlejuice	Beetlejuice	A genjutsu that simply creates horrible manifestations right in front of the opponent, causing a boo effect. Duration: 1,3,4

850	3	1	Heavenly Strike	Heavenly Strike	Using his mind weapon, the Shunmin is covered with light while Kanji appears in a circle right behind the Shunmin user. Each Shunmin gets to name their own special technique. Making it incredibly bright and nearly blinding the opponent, the various Kanji appear on the weapon as well as behind the user. The user strikes right in front of them, shattering the earth and rushing toward the opponent. Most of the time, the opponent will try to protect themselves from harm, only to find that the attack was just an illusion. Useful to escape tight situations. Duration: 1,1,1														
850	3	2	Army of Softness	Army of Softness	Teddy bears, monkeys, tentacle, or whatever, depending on their mood and their personality, the Shunmin creates 10-foot tall plushies. Each time the opponent hit the plushies, they will apparently pop, be destroyed...and then stand back up again as if nothing happened. This illusion is just meant to be annoying and it occupies the opponent. There is a total of 5 plushies. Duration: 1,3,5														
850	3	3	Vision of Decay	Vision of Decay	The opponent takes a look at the surroundings and himself to only see the surroundings decaying, falling apart and dying at an alarming rate. Even the Shunmin appears to be a zombie. The opponent then sees his hands and feet falling apart and eventually gets freaked out. At the end of the illusion everything returns to normal.

850	4	1	Shunmin Palm	Shunmin Palm	The opponent runs toward the Shunmin, or in whichever direction that he wanted to go, but apparently wherever he goes, he always seem to come back to the same spot. The Shunmin palm simply makes the opponent believe that he is running around while in reality he has been standing in place since the time that he decided to move. When the opponent realizes that he hasn't been moving at all, he will see a giant palm and with what appears to be the universe behind it. He will be in the middle of the palm and the Shunmin will be looking down over him, as if the Shunmin were a deity looking down at a lost soul. Duration: 1,3,5														
850	4	2	The Phantom	The Phantom	A very useful genjutsu in which the user convinces the opponent that the Shunmin is at a slightly closer distance than he seems to be. Effectively, the opponent would perform his attack far away enough from the Shunmin's true location not hit the Shunmin. Then the Shunmin would simply laugh at the opponent and pretend that he cannot be hit. Of course, the weakness of this technique is ninjutsu in general cover a large enough distance that this trick wouldn't work. Duration: 1,3,5														
850	4	3	Dream Cage	Dream Cage	The dream cage can be made of anything that the Shunmin can think of, i.e. bones or even toys, depending on the Shunmin's dreams and personality. The cage forms around the opponent; similar to being encased in a mime box, the opponent would believe themselves to be trapped. Since this jutsu only works on one person, if a teammate decides to walk into the cage, the illusion will be effectively nullified. Duration: 0,3,5

850	5	1	Tentacles of the Underworld	Tentacles of the Underworld	The Shunmin creates tentacles which sprout from every part of their body and rush toward the opponent, seizing him. The seized opponent will be unable to move. The tentacles looks vicious, to say the least, and look like some tentacles that would come out of a Kraken. The opponent can still speak and might want to consider calling a teammate for help. Duration: 0,2,4														
850	5	2	Utsusemi	Utsusemi	The user simply holds his right hand out from his body and after-images appear around the Shunmin. Six illusion clones to be exact. The opponent will have a hard time landing any hit on the Shunmin as he would mostly be hitting the images moving around and popping out of anywhere that the user wishes them to. The opponent would just phase through them, instead of being able to hit the illusory bunshin. Teleporting and jumping from anywhere, the bunshin can come out of any surface. This makes bunshin no jutsu seem like a bad joke. Duration: 0,2,4														
850	5	3	Hell Strike	Hell Strike	This time the Shunmin mind weapon creates an aura of violence and bloodthirsty intention that swirles around the weapon and the Shunmin. When the user slashes with his weapon, he is able to manifest any of the shunmin genjutsu that are stage four and under. This makes the weapon's attack always a random effect, and the opponent never knows what's coming next. However, the weapon must make contact with the opponent. Duration: 0,2,4

850	6	1	Alice Mirror	Alice Mirror	This genjutsu is a vicious kind, switching the opponent's right from left, so for a few instants every command that the opponent tries to take with his body will be inversed. If he thinks to move right, he will move left. If he tries to move his right hand, he will move his left foot etc. If he walks forward, he will indeed walk backwards. A mirror appears in the hands of the Shunmin and the opponent just has to take a look inside the mirror to succumb to these effects. After two posts, the opponent is able to figure out the inversion and even if the illusion is cast again during the battle, it won't be a problem. Of course, the opponent need to have recognized first that it was an illusion. Duration: 0,2,3														
850	6	2	Heaven Treasure	Heaven Treasure	The shunmin began Sitting like a monk and praying, the opponent travels through the six paths of reincarnation: the path to hell where people are tortured endlessly; the path of the hungry ghosts where those who seek powers are being devoured for eternity; the path of the animals, where wild animals are chasing and destroying anybody who jumps into their realm; the realm of Asura, where people are fighting in a never-ending battlefield; and finally the realm of humans, where absolute peace must be obtained or you will be attacked by heavenly guardians. The genjutsu effect is quite simple at the end of the trip: the Shunmin gets to remove one sense from the opponent. This effect can be stacked by multiple castings, until the opponent is as useless as a vegetable. Duration: 0,2,3 Note: At the end of the duration, the sense lost is recovered.														
850	6	3	Night Blanket	Night Blanket	The Shunmin can be walking to any place, indoors or outdoors. He creates some kind of a sparkling mist all around him which makes the places where the Shunmin is look like the universe. The opponent looks around and feels their eyes get heavy, and eventually they fall to sleep. Able to make an entire battlefield fall asleep if the subjects don't manage to break out of the genjutsu. The opponents must be in the mist for it to affect them. Duration: 0,2,3 Note: They are sleeping under the genjutsu duration.

850	7	1	Dream Body	Dream Body	A strange ability and wildly unique to the Shunmin clan, they are able to make missing organs or physical appendages via illusion and still fight as if nothing has happened. They simply use an illusion to create their organs, or whatever else they need to keep on fighting. The mind still believes that everything is going fine. Sadly, if used to save oneself from lethal wounds, death still comes at the end of the duration unless the wounds have actually been healed by a medic-nin. This jutsu cannot used to escape death by beheading, of course. Duration: 0,1,3														
850	7	2	Fairy Tale	Fairy Tale	The sky opens and the Shunmin grows to the size of a giant. Suddenly, the opponent is witnessing the Apocalypse. Everything is getting destroyed by the Shunmin, who is causing rays of light to fall from the sky and destroy everything in their path. If the opponent gets hit by one of the rays of light, he will enter a catatonic state and will eventually even die, lacking medical attention, if he suffers the full three-post duration. Duration: 0,1,3														
850	7	3	Phoenix Strike	Phoenix Strike	The Mind Weapon vanishes from the Shunmin's hand, turning into thousands of lotus petals. Then, giant versions of the weapon break out of the ground, forming a corridor between the opponent and the user. The Shunmin makes a sudden move with his hands and the weapons disperse again into thousands of lotus petals and attack the opponent. This will send the opponent into a deep coma as he sees the most terrifying sight that he has ever seen in his whole life, if the full duration of 3 posts is complete. Duration: 0,1,3

849	1	1	Lightning Release: Flickering Luminous Body	Raiton: Yurayura Hikari Karada	Forcing electricity to dance across their own bodies, the user can create light enough to illuminate dark places, and control the flashes enough to send messages in code to anyone who might be watching. When they're more skilled a shinobi can use this technique to cause to the electricity around their body in a chaotic, distracting, almost hypnotic dance or flare in a blinding light. Base Stage: Produce a light source Stage Two: Disorientate for one post Stage Three: Blind for one post														
849	1	2	Lightning Release: Static Strings	Raiton: Seiteki Suji	The user may create a sort of electric string for matters of electricity, attached to their fingers. Once someone or something passes through the string, the user is alerted by a mild shock. In the beginning it serves as a surveillance tool, though later it causes shocks in those it touches, making muscles spasm and twitch. Base Stage: Not visible to the eye, may only notify user of disturbance. Stage Two: Can cause minor shocks upon contact, causing target to trip or stumble. May also solidify into visible electric strings that can be used akin to real strings. Stage Three: Do not need to be attached to the user's fingertips.														
849	1	3	Lightning Release: Override	Raiton: Mukounisuru	Concentrating, the shinobi can create a five-meter diameter electric field around them. It is not particularly strong. Living things will not be affected at all. However Overide was not meant to be used against living things. All electronic devices within the field will dieÃ¢â‚¬â€communications units, security cameras, or magnetically locked doors fail to function. After using this jutsu, one can maintain the field by expending another stage one jutsu usage each following post.														
849	1	4	Lightning Release: Electric Shock Clone	Raiton: Dengeki Bushin	The Lightning Clone is a weak incarnation of lightning that resembles its creation only in silhouette. It is an ethereal, insubstantial thing that glows and sparks. It is incredibly weakÃ¢â‚¬â€incapable of surviving even the lightest of blowsÃ¢â‚¬â€but it moves at one fourth the user's speed (including bonuses) and on contact with an enemy it will disperse in a flash of electricity, quite painful. It is however useful only as a distraction and irritant. Base Stage: 1 Clone Stage Two: 3 Clones Stage Three: 5 Clones Stage Four: 7 Clones														
849	1	5	Lightning Release: Serrated Edge	Raiton: Kiwa no Kyoshi	Collecting electricity along the edge of a weapon, whether bladed or bluntÃ¢â‚¬â€which can be the user's own handsÃ¢â‚¬â€and cause it to rise from the weapon in sharp, serrated edges that tear into flesh as any real ones would. They're electricity in the end, however, and when they come into contact with someone they're zapped by it, made slightly numb by the escaping charge of the weapon. Stage Two: The electricity shoots through weapons and armor even while blocked, numbing body parts indirectly touching the weapon. Stage Three: The numbness has grown strong enough that deft movement would be impossible, making this a viable method of disarming an opponent.														
849	1	6	Open Slot: Willpower 4, Tactics 4																
849	2	1	Lightning Release: Deafen	Raiton: Rousuru	Collecting electricity between fingertips, user points towards a target and snaps their fingers. The sudden crackle of electricity creates an instant of loud, screaming noise, but the Jutsu directs the bulk of the sound toward the target, deafening them for a post unless they have some way to protect their ears.														
849	2	2	Lightning Release: Current Transfer Skill	Raiton: Nagare Isou no Jutsu	An overall simple yet very effective technique, the Cloud-nin creates a sort of electrical current on his hand, this current can then be transferred onto any weapon he happens to be holding. The next physical attack he performs is charged with this electrical current, if he blocks a weapon attack with his own weapon the current transfers over shocking the attacker. If by chance the user is not carrying a weapon he can transfer this current into his opponent's weapon shocking him, or can even hit him with this current. The shock itself is mild, resulting in sudden muscle jerks in the location touched. Base Stage: Must maintain contact with weapon Stage Three: Weapons charged can retain the current for 1 post after losing contact with user. Useful for projectiles														
849	2	3	Lightning Release: Concentration Marker	Raiton: Keichuu Saitensha	After going through a short cycle of handseals, the shinobi creates a small ball of static on the tip of their finger. They may hold out their finger toward a target and shoot it forward or simply place it on a surface around them. It sticks and may not be removed, though it is harmless on its own. However, with other techniques it is has the potential to be deadly. While it is attached all non-construct, non-stationary Cloud technique is drawn to the staticÃ¢â‚¬â€and therefore whoever the Marker is attached to. The Marker remains on its target for three posts, but vaporizes as soon as it comes in contact with any Cloud ninjutsu.														
849	2	4	Lightning Release: Lightning Bolt	Raiton: Rakurai	After making a few handseals, the user holds out their hand in the direction of the target. Electricity arcs out from their hand toward the target on a jagged path. It does not last long; only for a moment, but that is enough. On impact the bolt shocks the victim, wracking their body with electric shocks that cause their muscles to spasm. Stage Three: May be maintained for two posts Stage Four: Causes second degree burns on hit														
849	2	5	Lightning Release: Five Fingers	Raiton: Goshi	The user gathers chakra into their hands until their bristle and spark with electricity. Holding out their hands, lines of jagged lightning spark from each of the user's fingers toward the target in an irregular, difficult to predict path. These semi-solid fingers of lighting can pierce inches through skin before dissipating, leaving a tingling sensation and horrid pain. Stage Three: The user can user their other hand at the same time, doubling the potential sources of damage.														
849	2	6	Open Slot: Willpower 7, Tactics 7, Control 6																
849	3	1	Lightning Release: Volt Spike	Raiton: Den'atsu Kasui	Holding out their hands, a surge of lighting leaps from the user's fingertips to into the ground where the user indicates. It is nearly instantaneous and leaves no room to move, but it seems to have no influence in the first place. This is proven false on the following post. Anywhere within ten meters of the piece of ground struck, sparks of electricity begin to dance about the ground and leave the distinct smell of ozone, giving anyone nearby a cue to get away. Lightning screams from the ground into the sky a moment later, searing through them and leaving moderate electrical burns behind. Stage Four: Three spikes rise from the ground instead of one. Stage Five: Those struck twitch and spasm on the ground for a post before they regain their senses.														
849	3	2	Lightning Release: Small Lightning Shield	Raiton: Raikou Shou Tate	Holding a metal object, the user gathers electricity into it and uses it as a focus. They project an undulating white shield made entirely of lightning, two feet wide and completely solid. It may defend against stage two ninjutsu and level two strength. Unenhanced projectiles are no match for it. When struck the shield shocks the object striking itÃ¢â‚¬â€and perhaps whoever used itÃ¢â‚¬â€whether it breaks or not. Every post the shield is active they must expend a jutsu usage. Base Stage: Two feet wide, blocks stage/level two. Stage Four: Three feet, stage/level three. Stage Five: Five feet, stage/level four.														
849	3	3	Lightning Release: Detonation	Raiton: Bakuhatsu	Flashing a few quick handseals, the user causes all their Raiton Bunshin to disperse simultaneously and release an enormous electric charge into the air around them. Anyone close to the clones at the time will be overwhelmed by the power of it, suffering from a vicious spasm that will take them to the ground but never make them senseless.														
849	3	4	Lighting Release: Great Pulse	Raiton: Idaina Myakudo	Gathering chakra into their bodies and clapping their hands together, the shinobi releases a sudden burst of electricity from their bodies that goes in all directions in a three meter radius. The lighting coils around the bodies of all within, causing their muscles to twitch and stutter in microconvulsions for the next two posts, making fine control and taijutsu difficult, reducing their speed by one level for a post. If someone is reduced to no speed they collapse in full convulsions, unable to control their body. Only those with this jutsu are immune. Stage Four: By expending a usage a post, the user can make this a constant aura around their person. If the afflicted remove themselves from the aura for a post the influence is gone. Stage Five: By expending a usage a post, the user can cause anyone in his aura to continuously lose speed levels, losing one level when they are first in the aura, two on the second, three on the third and so on.														
849	3	5	Lightning Release: Electrical Transformation	Raiton: Denki no Henkan	Denki no Henkan allows the user to momentarily abandon their physical form to become electricity. They can move along conductive surfaces at a rate equal to their speed, even when such a route would not normally attract electricity, making light sparks and emitting a smell of ozone that can tip off that something is off. The user remains aware of the area around them within five feet, even while transformed and can leap to any metal object they can sense and have a clear shot too. Some shinobi have been known to use this as a method to trace power lines or move secretly by affixing themselves to a metal object in order to avoid suspicion. They can be forced out by violence or by being drenched in water. This technique lasts for two posts before jutsu usages may be used to refresh it.														
849	3	6	Open Slot: Willpower 10, Tactics 10, Reserves 8																
849	4	1	Lightning Release: Lightning Instantaneous	Raiton: Raikou Shunshin	The user disappears into a lightning bolt that arcs into the sky, rain and shine, and disappears. Another lighting bolt appears--no more than a mile awayÃ¢â‚¬â€that the shinobi has been before, and the lighting turns into the user ten feet before it reaches the ground. In combat it may only be used to escape. Stage Five: They may take up to four willing or restrained persons within arms reach with them.														
849	4	2	Lightning Release: Lightning Netting	Raiton: Raikou Kanaamu	A technique that created a spiderweb of electrical strings within fifteen feet of a point, attaching itself to roof and ceiling, tree and brush . . . Anything and everything. All those who pass through this web spasm as they touch the strings, and attempting to step through usually causes a chain reaction of convulsions until they fall to their knees. Those who know this technique are also immune to it.														
849	4	3	Lightning Release: Lightning Eel	Raiton: Raikou Unagi	The user creates an eel that can flow freely along their Lightning Netting and Static Strings. They may lunge out from the streams/threads and curl around a target's limb. Said limb is paralyzed as long as the eel remains attached to them. Because eel is also attached to the string/net/ electricity current from which it swims around, the target won't be able to move away unless they destroy the eel. More eels can be created at higher Stages, each can be directed individually so to attack multiple targets or overwhelm one target. Eel remains for 2 posts after coiling around target. Base Stage: 2 eel Stage 5: 3 eels Stage 6: 4 eels														
849	4	4	Lightning Release: Ball Lightning	Raiton: Kyuuden	Named and themed after the strange meteorological element, the user conjures a sphere of humming electricity struggling violently against the bounds of the user's chakra. The shinobi propels Kyuuden in a line toward a target with their chakra, usually at the ground. When it hits a surface kyuuden explodes in a tangle of lightning, dancing around the bodies of anyone within five meters of the impact point, leaving moderate electrical burns across their bodies and causing horrible trouble with fine motor functions for two posts, including those needed to make handseals.

849	5	1	Lightning Technique: Nue	Raiton: Nue	The user draws on ambient electricity in the air to create a mimicry of a creature of myth descending from clouds. With face of a monkey, body of a raccoon, legs of a tiger and tail of a snake, the electric chimera is a sight to behold. Twice the size of a lion, its compact size is compensated for its high speed and aerial movement. It's claws and tail is capable of cutting through wood and metal plates, causing heavy slashing injuries and 2nd degree burns. Capable of breathing out Stage 4 Lightning Bolt. Can be destroyed by Stage 4 nin techs and Level 4 Strength.														
849	5	2	Lightning Release: Sphere of Influence	Raiton: Eikyou Ken	The user expands a sphere 18 feet in radius around their person that lasts for three posts. All stationary metal objects within the sphere will become a base from which a column of lightning will rise up. Unless the metal objects are moved or dislodged from their positions, the columns will remain. Any subsequent cloud nin tech during Sphere's existence may, if the user chooses, leap out from any of the columns. If anyone touches column, they'll be shocked/paralyzed for 1 post in area touched. 16 Tactics: 18 Feet Radius 23 Tactics: 24 Feet Radius 30 Tactics: 30 Feet Radius														
849	5	3	Lightning Release: Rising Storm Technique	Raiton: Shinkou Arashi no Jutsu	Collecting electricity through his entire body he immediately pushes all of it into the ground below him, almost instantaneously bolts of lightning begin rising from the ground in a rhythmic ripple-effect out from him. The ripple-effect expands out in 5 rings with 3 feet between each ring for a total of 15 feet from the user. Projectiles are deflected in the process but ninjutsu Stage 5 and higher can drive though this maneuver. Attackers with stamina of Level 5 and higher can also break through, but target will suffer second degree burns and be painfully shocked in the process.														
849	5	4	Lightning Release: Chain Lightning	Raiton: Kusari Raikou	A useful technique generally used in an attempt to take out a group of enemies by surprise. Forming electricity into both hands the Cloud Nin launches a continuous stream of Lightning at one opponent, causing 2nd degree burns and severe shocks. Once the technique hits one person it immediately launches itself at the next non-friendly person who posts. The lightning chain specifically targets water that is found in the body, so bunshins are generally left untouched unless it's a Water Bunshin. Up to three jumps can be made.														
849	5	5	Lightning Release: Body Overcharge	Raiton: Karada Fukikakeru	After a series of seals the shinobi fills their very neurons with chakra, driving their synapses to fire faster and their bodily processes to run more effectively. They push themselves into a state of hyperactivity, their strength and speed boosted by one level for two posts. Their body bursts with electrical energy, and any who touch is touched by the shinobi will be surprised by an intense shock and second degree burns on their bodies. After their two posts are up the chakra drains from the body, leaving the shinobi exhausted for two posts during which they lose a strength and speed level.														
849	5	6	Lightning Release: Hands of Torture	Raiton: Hando no Semeku	Descriptions: Considered by most to be more of a torture technique then an actual attack the Jounin can lay his hands on his opponent and send several thousands of volts of electricity into the target. Depending how many times a Cloud-Nin has hit the opponent with this during a thread will depend on what happens. One post of being hit by this technique causes minor burns, chest constrictions, blurred vision, and overall pain. An additional post of being hit by this any other time during the thread will cause on-site second-degree burns, partial blindness, and an inability to breathe. A third post of exposure will cause a third degree burn on the spot that the hands touched and will cause major orificial hemorrhaging cause by internal bleeding, and unconsciousness. The fourth exposure causes death, and pretty much leaves the area smelling like burnt flesh.														
849	6	1	Lightning Release: Electron Beam Cluster	Raiton: Sennari Denshisen	The final evolution of Lightning Beam series. Rather than a single beam being throw across the distance, this one remains stationary but grows out. At every 9 feet, the bolt branches out into 3 beams. This separation occurs three times over the course of the entire technique, making the final coverage of 36 feet in length, 21 feet in width and height. This is often used against opponents who dodge or attempt to distance themselves from the user, as the further the target moves away, the more incoming beams they would have to counter. However, with each split, the power of the beam is lessened by one Stage, making the final 27 beams Stage 3 in damage. At Stage 5 and 6 equivalent splits, the bolts can easily tear smoking holes through flesh, wood, metal and stone and cause full body nerve decapitation upon contact. Stage 4 and lower, the beams cause same damage as equivalent stage Lightning Bolt.														
849	6	2	Lightning Release: Lightning Blossom	Raiton: Raikou Chiru	Causes any Cloud ninjutsu tech still active to blossom and explode in a flurry of medium-sized electric bursts over the length of the post, like a flurry of firecrackers than a single bomb. Though not as powerful as other single-detonation ninjutsu of its stage, with each burst somewhat lesser than explosive tags, there is more cumulative damage and harder to dodge/escape as these countless "blossomings" are randomly happening everywhere across the battlefield. Destroys all the Cloud techs it blossomed from.														
849	6	3	Electric Gyroscope Technique	Dendou Kaitengi no Jutsu	This technique offers the user both offensive and defensive capabilities, presenting some interesting strategic options. The user forms the necessary handseals and, by focusing his chakra, creates a pair of rings of electricity around himself, that spin about like a gyroscope, maintaining a constant electric field throughout its radius, which is half a meter from the user. If anything from outside attempts to enter this radius, the rings will shoot a blast of electricity potent enough to knock back a person and completely deflect ordinary projectiles. The shield will effectively block any taijutsu and ninjutsu Stage/Level 5 and below. An attacker with stamina above Level 5 will be able to enter the radius of the gyroscope, but will still suffer an electric shock as he enters. The user is able to move around while the shield is active with a -1 Speed level penalty. 22 Reserves: Jutsu lasts for 2 posts. 29 Reserves: Jutsu lasts for 3 posts. 36 Reserves: Jutsu lasts for 4 posts.														
849	6	4	Call of Lightning Technique	Yobigoe no Raikou no Jutsu	A dangerous technique, Call of Lightning is powerful and at the same time nigh impossible to control. Forming the necessary hand seals the shinobi begins to collect mist in his immediate area much like Kirigakure no Jutsu, however it begins to rise and form into a thunderstorm cloud instead of laying dormant. Now powered by chakra the cloud will begin to rain numerous bolts of lightning across the battlefield, the power of which has ability to cause massive third-degree burns, majorly constricted breathing, and possible fibrillation. This technique lasts until the maker of the storm cloud posts twice, during which they can direct one such bolt of lightning to strike somewhere within the storm.

849	7	1	Lightning Release: Avatar of Lightning	Raiton: Raikou no Keshin	A technique that will either win or lose a fight, with no middle ground. After completing the jutsu the shinobi's body will alter in coloration and shimmer until their body is nothing but a shining blue-white outline. They exist in a halfway-state between lightning and flesh, utterly impervious to physical damage, (but not ninjutsu) capable of causing third degree burns, passing through solid objects and manifesting Raiton without handseals. After three posts in this state the user becomes wholly flesh, their equipment burned away by the technique and too exhausted to use jutsu or move at more than a crawl.														
849	7	2	Lightning Release: Heaven's Judgement	Raiton: Kouten no Saiketsu	Following their seals the user holds both their hands in front of them, fingers outstretched. Electricity sings over their body, first in trickles, then in a flood, spilling out from their fingers and coating a cone seventy feet long and thirty feet wide at the longest in beautiful webwork lightning, hot enough to cook skin off flesh. The user may maintain this technique for two posts before their prepared reservoir begins to taper off.														
849	7	3	Lightning Release: The Descent of Shina	Raiton: Shina no Kourin	After a series of intense seals a cloud descends from the sky, whether it is created out of clear skies or pulled from the midst of a lightning storm matters little. Electricity crackles and hisses from the cloud as it plummets with incredible speed, leaving no question of its nature. When it hits the ground this cloud sweeps over it, extending fifty feet over the ground in all directions. Friends find the energy of the cloud miraculously avoids them, while enemies are struck by lightning on the spot and fried to the marrow, dead.														
849	7	4	Lightning Release: Raiden's Fury	Raiton: Raiden no Moui	A technique often used for the sake of demolitions purposes, the user flashes a number of seals and ends with their arms crossed and eyes trained on the spot they wish to call their technique down on. They rise a few feet off the ground and electricity surrounds their bodies with a halo of light while electricity rages in the atmosphere, glaring down within a twenty meter radius of the shinobi's target like a spotlight. During the user's next post lightning strikes the spot so quickly it seems like a solid pillar of light, and when it's done everything their light shined on is ashes or ruins.

848	1	1	Conductive Wave Technique	Shirube Nami no Jutsu	Trigger: Seeing the thrown weapon By throwing a shuriken or kunai, and performing the proper seals after it is in the air, it appears to be enhanced with high powered electricity. When it strikes a surface, it gives off a powerful jolt of electricity in a 5 foot diameter. If it hits a person, the electric shock is delivered directly. But the shock is only strong enough to make someone want to remove themselves from the area, like pulling their hand from a wall or leaping away. It hurts, but the kunai hitting would have hurt more. Duration: None Base Effect: One thrown weapon Stage Two: Up to three weapons Stage Three: Up to five weapons														
848	1	2	Projection Technique	Toei no Jutsu	Trigger: Physical contact After seals, this technique requires the user to touch the target with their bare skin. When contact is made, a single'thought' is transferred to the target along with a small static shock. The thought could be a single vague image, a phrase of a few words, or even something as loose as a concept hard to put into words. This thought slips to the target's mind, but in a way that isn't disruptive. Unfortunately, it will be seen as foreign, but it doesn't mean they will know the source. Because this illusion doesn't last, the thought is fleeting. Duration: None Stage Three: The transferred thought no longer registers as foreign.														
848	1	3	Thunderseal Technique	Raifuujin no Jutsu	Trigger: Proximity to ofuda paper seal When this technique is used on a prepared paper seal, the first person to get within a foot of the seal will set it off. The person that triggered the seal will hear a deafening crack of thunder as if it is going off right on top of them, removing their hearing for a post. If the user of this technique is within 150 feet, they will know the technique has been triggered because they can hear it too. Duration: None Stage Three: Triggers within five feet, reaches everyone within 15 feet Stage Five: Triggers within 10 feet, reaches everyone within 30 feet														
848	1	4	Media Breakdown Technique	Baitai Kawasu no Jutsu	Trigger: None Requiring only a single seal and vision on the target device. This illusion will make it seem like any devices with electronic output are unresponsive. The illusion only works on a single device, but will influence anyone who tries to access it will find readouts blank or stuck on an error, and the device will only make erroneous noises. Any other aspects of the device go unchanged, and any other signs it is working like normal are key to realizing this illusion is in place. Duration: None (Out of Combat). 1/3/6 (In combat)

848	2	1	Splitting Clone Technique	Bunretsu Bunshin no Jutsu	Trigger: None Creating two clones that are the spitting image of the user, these illusions can move just as fast, but are meant to be distractions. They cannot actually hurt anyone, must stay within a 40 foot area of where they were made, and any contact they make is like ripping through a marshmallow. When hit, they turn into a nebulous cloud for a moment, before reforming as two clones. As long as the user of this technique is still and holding the final seal, concentrating only on maintaining the jutsu, the duration is endless. It would be instantly ended by kai, but otherwise it will keep going. If the user participates in combat or is disrupted in some way, the duration begins as they are no longer maintaining their chakra. Duration: 1/3/5 Base Effect: two clones Stage Three: four clones Stage four: six clones														
848	2	2	Turning Weather Technique	Kaiten tenki no Jutsu	Trigger: None Used to disorient targets in the field, this technique will create a visual illusion of sudden storm clouds. It can be used on a group of closely bundled targets, but can only be maintained on one group at a time if they split off from each other for long. The storm clouds will roll in fast, and then cover the sky, threatening to rain or lightning but never quite doing it. This will cause difficulty for those counting on the sky for navigation, time of day, or landmarks. If they pay close enough attention, the targets would realize that the clouds move too fast, and always seem to be heading away from them no matter what direction they turn. This technique lasts as long as the user isn't noticed, or the usual duration if engaged in combat. Duration: 1/3/5														
848	2	3	Heavy Lightning Release	Buatsui Raiton	Trigger: Seeing the final seal After the final hand seal is complete, when the user moves their hands away from each other an arc of lightning will be between them that will then fly out toward the target in a wide arc. If they are hit by the arc of lightning, it will wrap around their body like a giant heavy rope, then one end will form a weighted ball made of lightning. The weight sends small painful jolts of electricity through the target whenever they move, and gives the sensation of some weight. If the target's genjutsu training is lower, their speed is lowered by 1 for each stage difference. Duration: 0/2/2														
848	2	4	Standardized Beacon Technique	Ittei Hoka no Jutsu	Trigger: Witnessing the marking of a kunai This Lightning Military technique was created to give units working in dangerous and ever changing conditions a way to organize themselves in the field. When the beacon technique is used, a kunai is shown to everyone. At any point later this kunai can be lodged into a solid surface and it will trigger the illusion. A beacon erupts into a thin column of light that vanishes into the clouds above. Only willing targets that saw the kunai marked can see the beacon of light, through any obstruction or illusion, and from then they can always see it as long as they are within 300 feet. Because the targets are willing, this technique can last a whole day, and can be refreshed on a target with a simple seal. Duration: Special

848	3	1	Hidden Assassin Technique	Hitoshirenu Shikaku no Jutsu	Trigger: Smoke Bomb and Key Phrase After saying any intimidation phrase, and then tossing down a smoke bomb, anyone that saw and heard both of them is a victim of the illusion. The user will appear to streak out of the cloud of smoke at a super fast speed with arcs of lightning left behind them. The difference in genjutsu training increases the speed of the illusion by 2 for every stage difference. The illusion stabs a knife into the target's chest, and there is the intense pain of the stab to the chest. Then just as fast, the illusion vanishes, leaving behind no wound. The pain of the blow remains as if the attack was real until the victim can rest and recover. Duration: None														
848	3	2	Lightning Release: Volt Nailbed	Raiton: Den'atsu Tsumeki	Trigger: Using'Volt Spike' the previous post A combination technique with Lightning Release: Volt Spike, Nailbed complicates escape for the target. The number of spikes is visually doubled, with the false spikes seeming to create the same effect as the real ones. There is twice as much electricity charging, and the Nailbed spike will also unleash a bolt of lightning toward the sky. Duration: None Base Effect: Doubles the number of spikes Stage Four: The false lightning will also cause a sense of pain, shocking the person if it hits. Stage Five: Triples the number of spikes														
848	3	3	Writ of Authority	Ken'i Reijou	Trigger: The repeated phrase'Pay attention.' Whenever the trigger phrase is said, the next document shown to the targets will appear to be a mark of higher authority than theirs. The technique replaces whatever the document does say with the vague concept of a badge or writ of authority. By itself this can get a shinobi into places, or shut up riff raff, unless they get curious enough to try to dissect what the document is talking about, in which case they would eventually realize the illusion is gibberish. This can also be used to mask what a document would say, as the actual contents will be blocked by the illusion. As long as the shinobi is holding on to the item, the illusion stays in place. The duration will begin as soon as they are no longer in contact with it. Duration: 0/1/1														
848	3	4	Mental Compass Technique	Seishin Rashinbin no Jutsu	Trigger: Being stuck in a genjutsu Sometimes knowing you are in a genjutsu is not enough to get out of it. This technique pierces illusions that give false or mazelike images. If the obvious path is being disguised by a genjutsu, like creating multiple paths or turning the user in circles, this technique will keep the user going the right way. They will be attracted to the right way to go, even if that means piercing the illusion. Against those particular types of genjutsu, this works like genjutsu kai, except it reduces duration by 3 per 2 stages of training. It counts as a Genjutsu Kai use. Duration: None

848	4	1	Cloud Cover Camo Technique	Kumori Meisai no Jutsu	Trigger: Any kind of smoke or cloud The Cloud Cover technique can be used to vanish, their body seems to evaporate into a wave of fog. Afterwards, the user appears to be a wave of fog or large puff of smoke as they move. Because the technique only masks their appearance and smell, it is necessary to stay quiet while moving. Even with that, if you attack someone, the technique's camouflage is weakened and anyone peering close enough has a chance to see you. This technique can be initiated right in front of someone by using the trigger of actual smoke or clouds, either produced by a technique or a smoke bomb. The duration for this technique only applies while in combat, or being scrutinized, otherwise it lasts as long as the user can make a seal to maintain it. Duration: 1/2/4 Stage Six: Two allies can also be camouflaged														
848	4	2	Five Point Seal: Lightning Barrier Technique	Go Kasho Fuu: Raikou Seki no Jutsu	Trigger: Proximity to Seal After making hand seals and then pressing their hands against a solid surface, a simple five point seal that scorches itself into the surface with lightning. When someone else comes within 15 feet of the seal, it triggers with a crack of thunder and then waves of lightning roil off of it filling a 30 foot area with waves of crippling electricity. If the user has more genjutsu training than any of the people caught in the range of the illusion trap, their speed levels are reduced by the difference. Every post, a taijutsu level will return until they are back to normal or the genjutsu wears off. Duration: 1/2/4														
848	4	3	Lightning Military Fortress Mind Technique	LMG Yosai Seishin no Jutsu	Trigger: Hit with a genjutsu Genjutsu experts within the Lightning Military Government have been drilled in a technique of genjutsu protection that requires fighting an illusion with an illusion. If the shinobi believes that an attack coming at them is actually an illusion, they can use a quick two hand seal combination to covers themselves in an illusion armor of dancing lightning. This works against all aspects of an illusion attack, able to block the assault, or knock away encroaching restraints. If the enemy genjutsu plays out in the user's mind, this technique doesn't require seals and can be triggered by will alone, manifesting instead as a chosen cherished person that will stand guard over their body. This will block genjutsu of stage three or lower that manifest as an attack that could be blocked. For the duration, it also lowers the remaining duration of genjutsu on the user by 1 post, every post. Duration: 1/2/4 Stage Five: Blocks stage four or lower Stage Six: Blocks stage five or lower														
848	4	4	Forbidden Technique: God-Release Servant of Shina	Kinjutsu: Shina no Dorei	Trigger: Bare palm contact with the target's head Considered a forbidden technique to practice among Hidden Cloud shinobi, Servant of Shina actually requires a powerful electric shock to pass between the user and the target. It is enough that both will be left in searing pain. The technique hijacks victim's instinctive fight response, flipping the switch on who should be seen as dangerous and who is an ally. Without a command, the target will think that allies pose an immediate and deadly risk to their life, and enemies should be protected. If the spasms, shaking, and wide-eyed movements are any sign, this technique does not actually make the victim take orders. Their actions are from a lower part of their brain, that cannot understand orders or pleas. Because of the terrifying nature of the application of this technique, both the user and the target have -2 in all their taijutsu levels, to a minimum of 1. Typically this technique wears off quickly, but in a non-combat situation the Servant of Shina technique can be used to torture a target until the effect will have a seemingly endless duration. No one would confuse the brainwashed fool for their normal self, and with enough corrective work from medical-nin, interrogators, or proper shock from those they recognize and love, they will come back to be themselves. Those thoroughly brainwashed by Servant of Shina have a distinctive mark, a burnt mark in the shape of a hand somewhere on their head. Duration: 0/2/2

848	5	1	Discharge Technique	Hibanahouden no Jutsu	Trigger: Touching the target with anything metal after the seals This intense genjutsu makes the target feel like their body is absolutely bursting with static electricity. Their hair feels like it is standing up, and they get goosebumps all over. Every movement seems like it is charging up even more power. When they touch anything besides the ground they will feel a body shaking jolt of electricity. For the next post their strength levels are lowered by the difference between the user's and the target's genjutsu training, to a minimum of 1. If this pushes the target's strength level down to 1, they will collapse. After the shock goes off, the technique immediately ends. The post after their strength is lowered, the target's taijutsu levels go back to normal. Duration: 0/3/3														
848	5	2	Lightning Release: Lightning Beam Playful Circus	Raiton: Kosen Kyokuba	Trigger: Seeing the handseals Similar to the Beam techniques within Raiton, this appears like a beam of energy that is shot out from the shinobi's hands after performing the seal. The beams of crackling energy bend in toward the nearest target, arcing in the air in spirals that can make it hard to avoid getting hit. Each beam is like getting hit by a lightning bolt technique, causing painful muscle spasms and the smell of burned flesh before the illusion fades and it is obvious that the attack was never real. The muscle spasms drop the target's speed and strength levels 1 each for the difference in genjutsu training, to a maximum of 3 and a minimum of 1. Every post they will regain 1 taijutsu level until they are back to normal. Duration: None Control 24: can split into 3 beams Control 31: can split into 9 beams Power 25: lowers taijutsu levels by an additional 1 Power 33: lowers taijutsu levels by an additional 2														
848	5	3	Lightning Military Advanced Surveillance Technique	LMG Kodona kanshi no Jutsu	Trigger: Inhaling smoke If the target has recently inhaled smoke, even in small amounts, this genjutsu can connect with them even from 50 feet away. After making the proper seals, the last seal is held and the user can see through the eyes of their target. This creates the odd sensation of buzzing in the head of the target, which can alert them to the presence of an enemy technique. A willing target can be connected to from up to 300 feet away, as long as the user can spot them. Duration: 0/2/4														
848	5	4	Forbidden Technique: God-Release Shina's Kiss	Kinjutsu: Shina no Seppun	Trigger: A kiss on the face With a kiss after making the proper seals, a powerful jolt of electricity will flow out of the target and into the user. The technique will daze the user and the target, hurting the user to the point of making it hard to concentrate enough to mold chakra that post or their next, unless to perform this technique again. The kiss drains the target of a specific knowledge, their loyalties. Each post that this technique connects, the user will gain a clear and accurate image of someone the target considers their loved one or superior. The nefarious part is that for the duration, that respected person's presence is replaced by the user in the target's mind. The user was their parent, or their teacher, or their leader, and the only thing they can think of when they try to bring those people up. Using this technique on a person multiple times will refresh the duration while stacking the effect. When used out of combat, and as a torture technique, Shina's Kiss can drain a person of everyone they love or care for, and replace it with their torturer. Like Servant of Shina, this leaves the victim in a dangerous mental state, though not obviously deranged like Servant of Shina. Medical care can fix them, and in rare cases so can extreme force of will when confronted by those they were forced to forget. Kiss leaves a telltale sign of a singed kiss-mark on the person's head.

848	6	1	Absolute Weather Control Technique	Zettai Tenkou Kansei no Jutsu	Trigger: None To all the targets in an area, the sky seems to change to terrible weather that the user controls on a whim. This could be a torrential downpour, a terrible blizzard that chills to the bone, or slicing winds that threaten to throw the target off their feet. Their vision and hearing can be muted by the terrible store, though they won't be completely removed. Every post that the targets are stuck in this, the user can give them -3 taijutsu levels spread as they please to their attributes (dropping them to a minimum of 1) to represent the weather and terrain making the target's movements difficult. If performed from a hidden position, this technique can be maintained on a target, following them no matter where they go. Once the user is discovered, the illusion is realized, or combat begins, the duration starts. Duration: 0/2/3 Tactics 21: -3 taijutsu levels Tactics 27: -4 taijutsu levels Tactics 33: -5 taijutsu levels														
848	6	2	Lightning Military Synchronization Technique	LMG Doki no Jutsu	Trigger: A whiff of smoke An advanced coordination method for teams operating in the field, Lightning Military Synchronization allows one shinobi to circulate visual senses and locations to a number of allies over a 70 foot area. In practice, this overlays the user's sight to one eye of the targets, who should be willing allies that took a whiff of a smoke capsule sometime before in the thread. The technique can be noticed by a sense of buzzing in the skull. The central user can switch whose vision is being shared to everyone with a single seal, and everyone will have an innate sense of where that person is in relation to them. Since this technique is voluntary, it has no duration. In an emergency, an enemy that has smelled smoke that post can be given a visual feedback loop that will blind them for a duration, but during that time the user cannot be using Synchronization on their allies. Duration: None (0/2/3 if used offensively) Control 21: up to 4 allies Control 27: up to 8 allies Control 33: - Up to 16 allies Power 20: Up to 70 foot area Power 28: up to 140 foot area Power 36: Up to 280 foot area														
848	6	3	Hidden Mind Technique	Hitoshirenu Shin'i no Jutsu	Trigger: Key Phrase and Explosive Tag The target must be able to hear the user shout a prepared phrase, though any intimidating statement will do. After that, the user makes handseals for this technique before they detonate an explosive tag, and if the target is hit by the knockback of the tag, they see a lighting bolt reach out and strike them. Their senses go white, and when their vision returns the whole world is frozen in the exact moment of the lightning strike, everything silent and perfectly still. If they try to think, or speak, they will hear an echo that goes on and on without interruption. When the illusion drops, they are usually standing right where they were, or laying on the ground. Duration: 0/1/1														
848	6	4	Forbidden Technique: Avatar of Shina	Kinjutsu: Shina no Dai Hito	Trigger: Eye to eye contact after being hit by a technique Avatar of Shina can be triggered from a distance, as long as the target was hit by a Shina or Raiton technique in the round right before and they lock eyes with the user. With a set of rapid seals, the genjutsu triggers and the target finds themselves on a barren peninsula, on the waterfront, while black thunderclouds rumble overhead. The location is clearly fake, but will feel familiar, like home. The user of the technique is there, as a construct, standing on the waterfront with them. Then the victim snaps back to reality, only having lost a little time. For the duration, anytime the victim attempts to mold chakra for a technique that threatens the user, they can make a single seal and the victim will instead be sent back to the waterfront scene for a few moments. In reality, the person seems to freeze up, their hands going slack, before they awaken again. When used as part of a torture method on a captured target, the avatar of Shina becomes more real for the victim. They will see it everywhere, walking among the people, in offices, on distant hills, always watching them. At random moments they will find it difficult to mold chakra, and they will be unable to act against the person who used the technique on them even without the user making a hand seal to stop them.

848	7	1	Second Strike	Rakurai Nikai	Trigger: Being hit by a raiton A terrifying but straightforward technique. If the target was hit by any raiton technique that presents as lightning, the user only has to finish the elaborate handseals of this technique. If they do, their target is stuck. The target's body overflows with arcs of powerful electricity, and then there is a crack of thunder. Lightning transfers to the target in a split second, zigzagging through the battlefield and piercing any obstacles necessary. It strikes the target in the heart, as far as the target or their allies are concerned this cannot miss. This technique causes the briefest instance of mind-shattering pain as if every nerve is being fried before the target goes numb all over. In addition to indescribable pain, this lowers stamina levels by 7 + 1 more stamina level for the difference in genjutsu training, and makes it impossible to perform taijutsu special techniques. The reduction in stamina levels remains for the rest of the thread, though the numbness recedes (but doesn't completely leave) after the duration. If the target's stamina reaches 0, their nervous system collapses and they will go into a coma. Recovery from this genjutsu requires intensive medical care. Duration: 0/2/2														
848	7	2	Nine Point Seal: Lightning Reins	Kyu Kasho Fuu: Tadzuna no Rai	Trigger: Proximity to seal After a hand seal, the user uses both hands to burn a 9 pointed figure into a surface. It crackles with immense energy that can be noticed by sensor techniques with ease. The user can use a release seal, and the closest target within ten feet has been trapped. The target will see a massive bolt of lightning come from the sky, or pierce through the ceiling, striking them and paralyzing their whole body as the lightning causes every muscle to convulse in agonizing spasms. For the duration, they cannot move of their own will. If their strength is lower than level 7, they can be forced to move at a walking pace in a direction of the user's choice, or they can be forced to the ground. It feels like they are being dragged by their neck. For the rest of the thread, any time after this technique's duration is over, if the target is hit by a raiton this genjutsu is triggered again automatically. Duration: 0/1/2														
848	7	3	Boundless Rage of the Lightning God	Raiden no Mugen Ikari	Trigger: Witnessing raised hand After the seals are completed for this technique, the user raises their hand in the air and to everyone who sees them, it looks like they are struck by lightning. On the other side they look like they have undergone a transformation, their hair white, their body crackling with electricity, their eyes dark red. For the duration of this technique, the user can direct an illusionary construct of themself that is filled with divine strength, speed, and durability. They appear to move faster than they do, leaving trails of lightning behind them and a mirage of them appearing at their destination before they get there, and every attack they make lashes out with five additional attacks in the blink of an eye, each laced with lightning that shocks and thumping with the full roar of thunder. Their voice, their steps, and their physical attacks, are all deafening to anyone within 60 feet that is perceiving the illusion. Getting hit by an actual attack from the user will stun a target for their post unless their stamina level is higher than 7, in which case they are only staggered. Duration: 0/2/4														
848	7	4	Forbidden Technique: God-Release Gift Of Raiden	Kinjutsu: Raiden no Megumi	Trigger: Targets must have been previously hit by a technique, and witness the user Gift of Raiden influences every target within a 60 foot area around the user. Everyone that has been previously hit by a raiton or Shina technique in this thread will feel an electric charge building up within them as the user goes through a long set of 13 seals to perform the technique. On the last, the user seems to get struck by a lightning bolt, shaking their whole body. Everyone within the 60 foot radius that saw the seals in completion will see lightning strike to them and be hit with the full blast. The attack is similar to Servant of Shina, changing the loyalty of everyone hit in an instant. Foe becomes friend, allies are seen as inherently life-threatening. The user is crippled by the violent force that ripped through their body, their taijutsu levels all lowering by 2 for the remainder of the thread. Duration: 0/2/2

847	1	1	Melting Sand	Hyoukai Sabure	Jutsu The most basic and necessary ability for this tree. It is through the techniques that all Crystal required for this tree is created. There are two abilities in this jutsu. The first is the ability to sense and gather sand beneath the ground. The second is that of making the sand into crystal through the use of a catalyst, lightning. The user gathers the sand below the earth into a place where lighting can easily be force through it. The user than gathers chakra, transforms it into lightning using the principles taught in the Lightning country, and forces it through the sand, melting it and creating crystal. All of the chakra used to make the lightning is now contained in the crystal and can be wielded through the manipulation of the flowing chakra.														
847	1	2	Window Panel	Mado Hame	Jutsu The Harimusha clan member literally pulls up the liquid Crystal and fills it with chakra refining it into a thin sheet of crystal. The crystal sheet is as tall as the shinobi as well as two and a half feet wide and two inches thick. This jutsu also serves as a catalyst for more powerful and important jutsu, but at this level it can be used as a shield to stop a single projectile before shattering. The crystal does nothing when defending against ninjutsu or melee attacks but it may cause irritation if struck with a hand. Base Effect: One window may be created. Stage 2 Effect: Two windows may be created. Stage 3 Effect: Three windows may be created. Stage 4 Effect: Four windows may be created;														
847	1	3	Breaking Crystal	Hyoumenka Hara	Jutsu Another very basic clan jutsu. By funneling chakra into any crystal, mirror, or glass the creation is forced to shatter into tiny shards. While it isn't technically dangerous alone it can make quite an ingenious trap with stronger jutsu later on. Do keep in mind that isn't its only use as it can maximize the damage of certain jutsu, cancel already in progress attacks, and create distractions. Base Effect: Affects objects of said material within a 10 foot radius. Stage 2 Effect: Affects objects of said material within a 20 foot radius. Stage 3 Effect: Affects objects of said material within a 30 foot radius. Note: Any crystal shards from broken or shattered crystal will have no offensive properties unless a jutsu utilizing the shards is performed. This is true for all subsequent jutsu.														
847	1	4	Crystal Bowling Ball	Hara Bo-ringo Butoukai	Jutsu Using the crystal created from Hyoukai Sabure it can be molded into a heavy crystal sphere that resembles a bowling ball. Three small holes are usually formed at the top of the ball so that someone's fingers may be inserted for easy use of the ball. The ball can be rolled or tossed at an enemy but oddly enough due to its delicate nature often breaks and bursts into tiny crystal shards. These shards can cause cut but nothing to deep.														
847	1	5	Crystal Slippers	Hara Uwazouri	Jutsu When activated this jutsu lasts the rest of the battle as long as a constant supply of chakra is fed to the feet. This causes chakra to keep the Harimusha user stable on any crystal floors that are created so they will not lose their balance. It allows them to run, glide, sprint, walk, and jump off of crystal as if it was normal stone or grass. Note: Will not work on walls or inverted surfaces until Kinobori no Jutsu is known and does not increase speed.														
847	1	6	Open Slot																
847	2	1	Crystal Item Creation	Hara Kajou Soushi	Jutsu By using a handful of crystal the Harimusha can make any small item that he wishes. At this level only small items such as kunai, shuriken, senbon, and even crystal containers can be made. The crystal usually shatters upon impact, including if it does break the skin, so that the enemy cannot throw it back and it may be able to get crystal shards stuck in a wound. The crystal may also be made transparent or opaque so that things such as explosive notes may be hidden in it, which only refers to the crystal container.														
847	2	2	Crystal Body Switch	Hara Kawarimi	Jutsu Yet another variation of one of the most common jutsu on the entire planet. Normal Kawarimi replaces the user with a nearby object, usually a log, while in Hara Kawarimi's case the user is replaced with a thick slab of crystal. Usually when hit depending on the strength, the crystal either crack and break into several pieces or receive minor structural damage. If the enemy uses a stage two or lower jutsu or has a strength less then half the creators power the slab of crystal simply has a chip removed while damaging the attackers hand. Like normal Kawarimi this may only be used twice per battle in conjunction with regular Kawarimi. Meaning that only a max of 2 Kawarimi's may be performed per thread.														
847	2	3	Walking Mirror Clone	Toho Kikan Bunshin	Jutsu A clone that is a mirror the size of the user made from crystal. The clone shares 1/10th the users stats and may use one known jutsu per thread granted it is a crystal technique and it has the proper stats. Base Effect: One clones may be created. Stage 3 Effect: Two clones may be created. Stage 4 Effect: Three clones may be created.														
847	2	4	Crystal Rose	Hara Bara	Jutsu A simple jutsu in which the user creates a special piece of crystal resembling a rose or other flower. The unique construction of the â€œflowerâ€ allows the crystal to pick up any sounds within 10 feet of it. The sound resonates within the flower to a frequency that can be picked up by a special earpiece also made during creation. The sounds can be clearly transmitted from the flower to the earpiece within a 400 meter radius. The flower is usually used in information gathering where stealth is important or a transmission contains sensitive material that cannot be intercepted. Up to two flowers can be created per thread, but only one may be listened to at a time.														
847	2	5	Crystal Hand	Hara Te	Jutsu After finishing a series of hand seals, two crystal hands will burst out of the ground attempting to grab the enemy about the ankles and hold them in place. The hands are just slightly larger than the user's and can stretch 1 foot from the surface. If the hands grab the opponent, he will be bound for one post (grabbed and bound in the same post) unless he has a base strength equal to half of the Harimusha's control. Then he can break free.														
847	2	6	Open Slot																
847	3	1	Fiber Crystal Fields	Sen'I Hara Nora	Jutsu Fiber crystal is easily one of the most annoying things ever. It cuts, stings, sticks, and plain old annoys everything in sight. By breathing out a cloud of fiber crystal in any which direction it litters the ground within twelve feet with tiny sharp pieces of fiber crystal. Anyone dumb enough to step in it has it erupt into the air as a dust cloud of crystal where it sticks to their skin and causes irritation and cuts. Base Effect: Jutsu lasts for 2 posts. Stage 4 Effect: Jutsu lasts for 3 posts. Stage 5 Effect: Jutsu lasts for 5 posts.														
847	3	2	Slip and Slide	Tsukegami Soshite Waku	Jutsu By using Hyoukai Sabure no jutsu as a base the Harimusha can transform the ground beneath them into extra slippery, solid crystal. The created crystal is usually hard to walk on or keep your balance on for a long periods of time. Usually Hara Uwazouri (Crystal Slippers) is needed to walk on the crystal without falling. Base Effect: An area with radius of 20 feet is covered in crystal. Stage 4 Effect: An area with radius of 25 feet is covered in crystal. Stage 5 Effect: An area with radius of 30 feet is covered in crystal.														
847	3	3	Looking Crystal	Sewa Hara	Jutsu Using Mado Hame the Harimusha can connect several panes of Crystal with chakra. These windows essentially become a way to look into another area with out being there. The user can change which window he is looking through by creating minor chakra surges throughout the window. These surges can be used to change the size of the original panel but can never be smaller than 4"x4". This jutsu is ideal for spying or searching for people or even getting a view at an enemies back side among other things. To use this, a window must be within 30 yards.														
847	3	4	Lightning Crystal Kunai	Raikou Hara Kunai	Jutsu By forming a crystal kunai with Hara Kojou Soushi no jutsu the shinobi can store the lightning used to actually create the crystal inside of it. (The blade, not handle) This causes the crystal to release sparks as it moves through the air and even glow a slight red color. The lightning kunai can then be thrown at the enemy, obviously, and upon impact with an enemy it sends shocks through out the targeted limb. The shocks contain the power of Raiton: Raikou Boruto no Jutsu (Stage 2).														
847	3	5	Mirror Arsenal, Confusion	Kikan Heikishou, Konemi	Jutsu Possibly one of the most hectic jutsu of the tree. The shinobi makes several small mirrors with any available crystal. Then using chakra to make them levitate into the air in a circular pattern around the battle the user can almost create utter chaos when throwing a projectile. When a projectile is released for every mirror an additional projectile of the same design is released at the target from the direction of one of the mirrors. When used in combination with clones it is nearly impossible to tell which one is real unless the enemy has a keen eye because the fake projectiles often release glimmers of light before hitting. The mirrors last a total of one post. The mirrors create one holographic projectile for every real one thrown. Base Effect: Two mirrors are created. Stage 4 Effect: Four mirrors are created. Stage 5 Effect: Six mirrors are created.

847	4	1	Crystal Chasm	Hara Tanima	Jutsu Refining any available crystal in the ground the shinobi creates a hollow square. The block is almost ten feet deep, ten feet wide but only six feet long. When a victim steps on it or if they are on top of it when it is created under them, the top piece shatters causing anything and anyone on it to fall inside the pit. After this occurs one of three things can be done, the first being the most obvious. The first one causes the top sheet of crystal to reform trapping the enemy inside of it acting as a prison. The prison can be broken with a ninjutsu of stage 3 or a strength (with bonuses) equal to the Harimusha's control. The second use is simply letting the broken crystal fall into the pit with the victim obviously slicing them up. This is often combined with Hyoumenka Hara no jutsu to cause the crystal walls to break as well for even more slicing and dicing action. The third and final use is setting up traps inside the case such as explosive tags trapping the target inside with whatever the trap is.														
847	4	2	Crystal Weapon Creation	Hara Buki Soushi	Jutsu A more advanced version of the normal Hara Kajou Soushi no jutsu. Before only small things can be created but at this can create things such as katana, short swords, small axes, daggers. Basically anything that is a weapon but still not that large such as a broad or cleaver sword. These weapons are semi durable and can be used in combat amongst normal weapons but after being used to much they are known to shatter so making more then one may be advised. Only up to two weapons may be created at a time. Please note that normal weapon rules apply and you may not, for example, use two cleaver swords at a time.														
847	4	3	Crystal Spike	Hara Gosunkugi	Jutsu A commonly used jutsu for almost any clan member. The clansman causes the crystal beneath him to shift in a circle until a perfectly shaped spear of crystal is released upwards from the ground. The spear is about three feet in length and several can be created at a time. Each spike can then be â€œlaunched' at the target as if from a cannon after the shinobi pulls them out of the ground. Please keep in mind when making several spears they do not come from the same swirl, rather you make several swirls at the same time. Base Effect: Two spikes may be created. Stage 5 Effect: Three spikes may be created. Stage 6 Effect: Five spikes may be created.														
847	4	4	Grasping Crystal	Shuunran Hara	Jutsu The Harimusha can send chakra into any available crystal but instead of expanding it to cover the entire area, a pillar of bending and curving crystal is released towards the enemy. When it is first released it is only about two feet high but can literally stretch up to twenty feet to grasp a jumping enemy in its icy cold interior. Upon making contact the crystal wraps itself around the enemy's feet or legs and crystallizes upwards usually stopping at the waist. If the target is caught in the air they are actually held in the air. The binding crystal lasts two base posts but someone with a higher strength + bonuses than the Harimusha's Control + reserves can break it with ease.														
847	4	5	Breaking Fields	Hyoumenka Nora	Jutsu The Harimusha member uses a large sum of chakra to turn all of the ground in one direction into pure crystal. The affected area can be no larger than 5 meters long x 1 meters wide. After the first phase is complete the crystal is often shifted up to make the ground irregular and almost mountainous and after that the Harimusha forces the ground to literally explode outwards in a wave of crystal with a blast radius of 5 meters. Anyone caught inside of the explosion often finds themselves with many, many cuts and some crystal pieces sticking out of their skin. While this jutsu is not fatal it is very painful and makes one hell of a combination with Saiten Ten no jutsu.														
847	4	6	Open Slot																
847	5	1	Crystal Clone	Hara Bunshin	Jutsu A much better version of the Walking Mirror Clone. This clone is not done with mirrors but is a physical manifestation in the likeness of the original shinobi. This jutsu will create a number of clones that do not require continuous chakra input from the user. The clones have full base stats as well as 1/3 of any bonuses beyond that. 16 Reserves: One clone may be created. - 23 Reserves: Two clones may be created. - 30 Reserves: Three clones may be created.														
847	5	2	Piercing Tentacle	Ketatamashi Shokushu	Jutsu By shaping any available crystal the Harimusha can create what looks like a single tile in the ground. The tile can travel along any terrain style for up to twenty feet before going out of range and the user must hold their final hand seal to move the tile. Upon the release of that seal and the formation of several more seals the tile bursts outwards into a very thin, sharp, and smooth tendril made of pure crystal. The tentacle can travel at high speeds towards the enemy and turn up to 360 degrees. Upon being released it can travel an additional thirty feet before coming to a halt. The tendril has the power to impale the target and even break bones if the enemy is unlucky enough to have a bone hit. 16 Reserves: One tentacle may be created. - 23 Reserves: Two tentacles may be created. - 30 Reserves: Three tentacles may be created. Note: If the tendril fails to strike someone no matter how long it is instead of shattering or turning back into sand the long crystal blade hangs in the air. Also note this can be used in combination with Hara Tanami.														
847	5	3	Invisible Orb	Meimei Kyuutu	Jutsu An odd technique that serves as a shield. By creating a dome of crystal around the user that usually extends out several feet in every direction the shinobi creates an artificial defense. The solid crystal dome requires a strength(Bonuses included) equal to or greater than the users power + Control to shatter or a stage six or higher ninjutsu to shatter. The dome will last for one post. The dome will crumble to pieces after the post limit has passed. Holding it out for so long forces them to take one post to recover in addition they cannot use the dome again for three posts. Also, the user must have a hand either on the ground or the wall of the dome at all times while the shield is activated. If their hand is removed, the dome will begin to break as if the post limit had been reached.														
847	5	4	Giant Crystal Object Creation	Hara Kyojin Mono Soushi	Jutsu Basically the final form of crystal item creation. At this point the user can take a large sum of crystal and literally form it into any shape they want granted that it isn't over two feet bigger than they are. The crystal is far more durable than the one handed version so it takes longer for it to shatter (Granted you aren't missing and hitting solid rock) but only one item may be created at a time. Things like cleaver sword/axes, Bo staffs, and maces may be created but there isn't anything stopping you from making a life like statue of yourself, if you are into that kind of thing.														
847	5	5	Crystal Skin	Suishou Hada	Jutsu Solid crystal in its liquid form completely covers the user's body making them a solid white figure. The crystal then hardens to an extreme level but is kept malleable and flexible due to continued contact with the source of chakra. The user retains full range of motion and can move, see, and hear as if the crystallized surface were not there. The armor requires a good deal of the user's stamina and Control only lasting the number of posts equal Control divided by 6. 19 Control: The armor is impervious to ninjutsu of stage 4 or lower and physical attacks by those with a base strength of 17. - 26 Control: The armor is impervious to ninjutsu of stage 5 or lower and physical attacks by those with a base strength of 21. - 33 Control: The armor is impervious to ninjutsu of stage 6 or lower and physical attacks by those with a base strength of 25. 18 Reserves: The armor lasts 3 posts. - 25 Reserves: The armor lasts 4 posts. - 32 Reserves: The armor lasts 5 posts. Note: This jutsu does NOT increase one's strength or attack power for the sake of balance and simplicity.														
847	5	6	Open Slot																
847	6	1	Hara Maru	Hara Maru	Jutsu The Harimusha member performs the necessary hand seals and then slams their palm on to the ground while yelling the jutsu's name. As they do so, a wave of crystal will emerge from their central location and stretch out in every direction. It will cover everything (with the exception of people and animals) for 75 feet in every direction with a layer of crystal, including trees, bushes, homes and what ever else is in its way. The crystal is as slippery as wet ice and is extremely difficult to walk on without the aid of Reinigiri, Suimen Hokou no Gyou or Hara Uwazouri. The purpose of this jutsu is to not only put the opponent at a distinct disadvantage but also to create a wealth of crystal ready to be used by the Harimusha.														
847	6	2	Disco Ball: Death	Disuko Butoukai: Oujou	Jutsu Ah what an odd name, quite humorous too. Basically the user creates dozens of sheets of crystal and melts them together to form a gigantic disco ball of sorts. The ball is attached to a chakra string and is hoisted about twenty feet over head of the battle where it hangs ominously, or well maybe it would just make the enemy think you have a really tacky sense of fashion, and bad idea of what is good music. Anyway, by carrying around the string the user can pump chakra directly along the wire and into the ball forcing several pieces of the crystal to erupt outward as crystal tentacles. The tentacles launch down towards the ground in a fashion similar to Ketatamashi Shokushu no jutsu, and the large tendrils will also withdraw back into the ball after making an assault. 21 Intelligence: Disco ball will last for 4 posts. - 28 Intelligence: Disco ball will last for 5 posts. - 35 Intelligence: Disco ball will last for 6 posts.														
847	6	3	Crystal Giant Cicada	Kurisutaru Kyojin Higurashi	Jutsu Using a large sum of crystal and chakra the Harimusha member can craft a giant made of pure crystal. While no giant are identical and each has their very own minuet details they are all the same in essence. Each giant stands up to ten feet tall and typically has details that resemble a gigantic cicada including gigantic crystal wings, and multiple legs. Due to the material the giants are made of they are extremely slow and not agile at all. They can hardily dodge attacks, and barely keep up a jog that would make an old man look fast. But while all of these are true these giants are extremely durable and extremely strong. Getting hit by one would surely equal having a bone or two broken and probably leave some rather nasty gashes. If the shinobi chooses to he can make the Cicada's burrow underground in order to sneak up on an enemy. As for the durability like I stated before they are extremely hard to break, it requires a strength of at least fifty or a stage six jutsu but it would probably be much wiser to just run from them. Please keep in mind that these giants last for a base of three posts and cannot be summoned again until ten turns have passed. Stats- Strength: 30, Speed 5, Stamina 30 22 Reserves: One cicada can be created. - 29 Reserves: Two cicada can be created. - 36 Reserves: Three cicada can be created.														
847	6	4	Through the Looking Crystal	Tsuujite sono Sewa Hara	Jutsu This essentially takes Sewa Hara no jutsu and takes it to the next stage. The pathways connecting the window are far more stable so that certain things may cross through it. Things like weapons, projectiles, items, and tags may go through it but anything like a jutsu will cause it to break. (Including jutsu created items) The pathway is too uncontrollable for live flesh to touch it and chances are anyone trying to go through it would cause the person to literally rip apart. Keep in mind the creator must send chakra to it to open the pathway so throwing something back is a little hard and can only be done simultaneously when the chakra touches the window. To use this, a window must be with in thirty yards.														
847	6	5	Angel Wings	Mitsukai Tsubasa	Jutsu A graceful jutsu of the Harimusha few see and live to tell about. The technique requires the user to know Suishou Hada as the wings are an extension of the skin. Upon creating the wings, the user automatically knows how to use them as an extension of themselves. They require no prior training or instruction. The wings have an average span of about 14 feet from tip to tip. The feathers are made completely of crystal and are as sharp as kunai. The wings can be used offensively but are limited to mainly swoops, slashes, and swipes as there are not very dexterous. The wings can also be used as a defensive measure. By wrapping the wings around oneself, most projectile attacks can be deflected as well as some physical attacks. The wings have the ability to block two stage 5 jutsu a thread but will be so tattered and torn after the second that they will not last after the second attack. The wings may only be summoned once a thread. Note: A base strength equal to the Harimusha's control is needed to break through the wings with physical contact. Also, flight is out of the question.

847	7	1	Maze of Lost Souls	Meiro Rosuto Kontan	Jutsu Easily the most powerful jutsu for the entire clan and one few people often reach. This breathtaking and amazing jutsu has three phases that will bring it to its peak of power. First and foremost the user must obviously charge a large sum of chakra over an entire post before using this jutsu. When that is completed they can release that chakra into any amount of crystal and simply have that crystal expand to encompass a fifty yard radius. That chakra is then released causing a large square of Crystal reaching about ten feet high to surround the entire area. Following the first square thousands of more opaque crystal walls of the same height jut out from the sand forming what would seem to me a maze. Endless corridors, confusing turns, dead ends, and many paths that lead back to where the enemy started fill this vile maze, they don't call it the maze of lost souls for nothing, hell it only has one exit. To keep an enemy from simply jumping out of the maze the top of the maze is coated with a translucent crystal that lets light in but sadly for the victim nothing out. The user himself could easily maneuver through the maze by molding the crystal with his chakra so that it simply parts itself allowing the user to walk through the created hole. While that alone is enough to annoy an enemy to no end and most likely get them lost that isn't the end of it. The third phase comes next and it is the most dangerous phase as well. When the Harimusha member finds himself with in twenty yards of his enemy he can activate a number of jutsu that make this confusing maze into a deadly maze. Jutsu such as Ketatamashi Shokushu no jutsu, Hara Tanima no jutsu, Tare Shanderia no jutsu and many others can be used while inside here and still at a range thanks to an amazing jutsu called Sewa Hara no jutsu. To break through a pane of crystal the enemy must have a strength (Bonuses included) greater than the Harimusha's Control + power. A ninjutsu of stage 5 will break the inner panes of the maze but not the outermost. A stage 6 jutsu is required to break the outer walls and ceiling. The crystal maze lasts as long as one half the creators' reserves. The jutsu takes such a large amount of chakra that the creator often finds himself tired after creating it so they must take one turn to recover before moving on. Once the technique is totally done and gone through all faces and dissipates the user may find themselves unconscious. This may only be used once per thread. Note: Note that the crystal coats over all the terrain flattening it back into the ground.														
847	7	2	Marking Point	Saiten Ten	Jutsu Quite a deadly jutsu, by forming a complex set of hand seals a certain area can be marked with something that can only be labeled as a chakra beacon. While in essence it isn't a pure chakra beacon it is simply a crystal pillar that raises a few feet off the ground that emits large waves of chakra to any crystal in the area. These waves of chakra cause any crystal to shatter into extremely sharp and rigged shards. The next post all the broken crystal slowly, at first, lifts of the ground and points towards the beacon. With in what feels like a second all the crystal begins to fly towards the beacon slicing and dicing anything in its way and any unlucky soul that is caught in the middle will most certainly die. Once the crystal reaches the beacon it shatters and clings to it until all the shattered crystal in the area converges on one single spot creating a giant ball of broken crystal. Note: If not properly prepared the crystal will also hurt allies and yourself since you can't technically Control it.														
847	7	3	Spearhead Field	Saizensen Ryouiki	Jutsu The user holds their hands palm up while concentrating large amounts of chakra into the ground via Hyoukai Sabure. During this process, the hands of the user will seem to be covered in violent electricity as they form the crystal needed. Once a field with a radius of half a mile has been prepared, the attack is ready. Quickly, the user thrusts his hands into the air bringing them together at the apex, hands forming a cup. As they do this, crystal spears will begin to launch out of the ground at incredible speeds reaching up to 20 feet. The area will be covered by giant crystal spears in a matter of moments. A small circle where the user stands at the center of the field will be the only spot within the radius absent of spears. Note: This jutsu only requires opponent permission if he or she is within the radius of the attack.														
847	7	4	Ultimate Crystal Clone	Kyuukyoku Hari Bunshin	Jutsu The user, having reached the zenith of crystal Control , is now ready to learn and utilize their most powerful clone. The clone, made of pure crystal, is formed into a humanoid mass resembling a manikin. When the clone is made, it is given the crystal wings that almost all Harimusha know at this level. If they do not know Mitsukai Tsubasa, the clone will not have the crystal wings. The clone is armed with all of the Harimusha's clan jutsu of stage 6 and lower but may only use two jutsu before collapsing into a pile of sand. Also, the shinobi's main weapon is cloned as well so that it may fight using a Tai style. The clone has full base stats of the user and 1/2 of their taijutsu bonuses. The user can summon one bunshin at a time, but twice a thread.

846	1	1	Enfade	Fuuka no Jutsu	Making a quick, single handseal, the user chooses an object before casting the illusion. The user whistles, and if the whistle is perceived then the illusion is triggered. The target in question suddenly appears to have been heavily weathered with vegetation growing over it: making a thing appear as if it hadn't been touched in years in a matter of an instant. Buildings appear to be horridly cracked, vines and plants growing in and around them: weapons suddenly seem brittle and wrapped in vines. Attacking with a weapon, or touching something seeming effected will dispell this effect instantly.														
846	1	2	Flower	Hana no Jutsu	Descripiton: The user opens their hand to reveal something, and if the target watches then the genjutsu is triggered. The user appears to have created a single flower; dandelion, rose, what have you. Then if they look at the ground there will be lots of flowers, any stable ground they look at is covered in flowers, obscuring the actual details of the ground.														
846	1	3	Love of Nature	Tensei Aikou no Jutsu	Upon hearing the trigger words 'Look around you', the forest and nature around the target will suddenly seem highlighted mentally. It isn't so much that everything else is out of focus, as much as anything natural is more in focus, drawing importance to it and making it hard not to take notice of it.														
846	1	4	Grass Stalks	Kusanone no Jutsu	The user holds the final seal of this jutsu for an extra moment, using it as the trigger for the genjutsu. Then when they make a throwing motion, sharp needles of grass seem to fly towards the target with a noticeable '˜fwip' sound. The needles are never actually felt though. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1

846	2	1	Nature's Espionage	Etai Teichi no Jutsu	After concealing their form in any way (from kicking up dirt, throwing dust, or throwing smoke, etc.) anyone who witnesses the cover is caught in this genjutsu. The user takes on an appearance similar to any natural occurrence near them, the colors of their skin as well as their hair and clothing become the same as the background, making them difficult to notice in comparison to their surroundings. They cannot look similar to man made objects. If the user is touched by someone, even an ally, this genjutsu is dispelled.														
846	2	2	Rise of Nature	Hamukau Etai no Jutsu	If the enemy sees the last handseal of this genjutsu, they will suddenly see the plants in the area moving towards them slowly, growing inch by inch. The plants never actually touch the enemy though. The movements are rather threatening, they sometimes grow upwards and try to slam down on the enemy, or wrap around their leg. Even if there are no plants, they begin to grow from the ground. Afterward, they disappear.														
846	2	3	Allergic Reaction	Kafunshou no Jutsu	Upon opening their hand as if throwing something, which triggers the genjutsu if noticed by the target, a small cloud of spores flies at the enemies face. For the remainder of the genjutsu they will fill a tickle at their nose, once per post, causing an urge to sneeze. For some odd reason, no matter the duration left, this can be dispelled by kai in one shot.														
846	2	4	Clamp	Kasugai no Jutsu	The user makes a single, two handed handseal, before stomping one foot to the ground. If the opponent notices the stomp, the genjutsu is triggered. Under the enemy, a venus fly trap the size of their leg pops out of the ground by swiftly popping up, then attempts to bite at their leg. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	2	5	False Spikey Balls	Heki Gosunkugi-Tama no Jutsu	After handseals the user coughs into their hand (which serves as the trigger if seen) before taking in a deep breath of air. When the blow out, anyone who witnessed the trigger will see green golf-ball sized balls spit out in a flurry. When they soar through the air, they will grow in size and extend sharp spikes. These balls never actually hit their target, and cannot even cause illusionary damage. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1

Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 2														
846	3	2	Nature's Wrath	Doki Etai no Jutsu	The user whistles after handseals and if the target hears it then they are caught. This genjutsu takes immediate effect. Plants seem to break through the ground behind teammates, enemies, animals, anything living in the area that they are aware of. These plants quickly cover them and after a long, mighty scream and a sudden spray of blood, 'drags' them underground. Afterward, they appear to 'sink' out of the ground. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	3	3	Aerial Assault	Kakuu Kagai no Jutsu	After forming the handseals, the user raises his hands to the sky. Those that look at his raised hand are trapped in the genjutsu and the shrill sound of an eagle letting forth a mighty cry can be heard. Ripping down from the skies comes forth a mass of eagles that seem to darken the sky almost completely; blocking the user out of sight from the opponent. Regardless of evasion, the birds seem to hit, they pick and peck at the enemy mercilessly for the post. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	3	4	False Root Spear	Heki Tsukene Yari no Jutsu	Simple enough. if they happen to see the user as they finish handseals, A spear made of roots attacks the target,. Where it comes from is up to the user. This feels very much real before collision, and bears incredible similarity to the Ninjutsu of the same name. There is an obvious reason for such a similarity. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	3	5	Demon Roots	Oni Yari no Jutsu	At random spots around the battlefield, one almost always close to the target, the ground explodes into a mess of exposed roots. This is activated by the target seeing the user while performing it, and if they stay still the shrapnel will cause overwhelming illusionary pain. Luckily, this fake barrage can be easily dodged.

Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	4	2	Godly Strength	Kamigami riki no Jutsu	After completion of seals, the user claps loudly, anyone who hears the sound is caught. The user will appear totally normal. That changes when they start moving. Every step they make the earth cracks. A single breath causes trees meters away to rustle. Punches seem to rip giant craters into the ground, and even a limb so much as tapped by the user will suddenly feel like it was snapped in half. Everything returns at the end of the genjutsu; none of the craters or broken things are real, mere genjutsu making them appear as they did'¦well, unless the user was actually that good, but that's doubtful.														
846	4	3	Thousand Grass Cutter	Senbai Suu no Jutsu	The user throws a hand up into the sky, if the opponent looks at the hand they are caught. The motion causes a rain of grass stalks, all three inches in length, to fall towards the earth in a swirl. They seem to float daintily towards the enemy for the first second, and then afterward, they become much more deadly. Each single stalk seems to be sharper then even the greatest blades, slicing through weaponry, armor, and the body of the opponent. Even if the opponent moves they will find their mark. Naturally, due to their size, they can't go far into the body, just an inch. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	4	4	False Thorn Dragon	Heki Keiryu	After stomping on the ground for a trigger, the earth seems to swell up until a 4 meter long European dragon made of vines and thorns from the ground. During its one post of activity the beast well spray a wave of thorns towards any targets before it. This gives the appearance that the beast is not only attacking those trapped in the genjutsu, but their allies. Not only the thorns are dangerous, but being hit by the beast flapping wings can be just as painful. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	4	5	False Instant Relocation	Heki Kusa Shunshin	(New) This genjutsu is triggered by holding a tiger seal. Anyone who perceives the seal will see a large flurry of grass rise up around the target and cycle around them as if they are performing Kusa Shunshin. But that is not all. Within the cycle of grass the user can escape, and a single illusionary clone is created of the target. This clone cannot move from where it appears, but it can wave and taunt a target from its location.

846	5	1	Chameleon	Gisou no Jutsu	After causing a debris based distraction (dust, sand, smoke) the user becomes invisible to those he does not wish to be seen by (read: enemies; teammates may see him/her normally), blending in totally with the background. If he was to make a sound, it would be heard, but otherwise, his scent is hidden from detection. This can be used on the user's items as well, but as soon as it leaves their touch it will become visible again. Being noticed breaks this genjutsu.														
846	5	2	Monstrous Plants	Kaijuu Koubu no Jutsu	Once making eye contact with a target, they will see plants of the user's choice burst forth from the ground, quickly growing to any size of their choice; though it cannot exceed the size of a summon such as Manda or Gamabunta. They mutate in the very same post, becoming monstrous mutations of what they once were. Sunflowers may become a large plant full of kunai-shaped seeds in the middle and a mouth that could swallow things whole, and you get the whole idea. Any injuries they create disappear after the duration. Base Effect: 2 plants can be made -Intelligence 24: 4 plants can be made --Intelligence 31: 6 plants can be made														
846	5	3	Hell Leeches	Makai Hiru no Jutsu	This Jutsu is activated vocally. Any sound will do. Leaping up from the ground, a leech latches on to any exposed flesh the target's body, sucking hungrily at his body for two posts before falling off. During this time, the victim feels immense illusionary pain, as if being impaled by a rusty spear or katana. That's not all, though. The leech burrows into the skin, and the skin closes in after its entrance. The feeling of a leech burrowing through your internal organs is not a pleasant one. If they use this Jutsu again after it has expired, it merely feels like the leech has begun moving again. With repeated usage, it becomes more painful.														
846	5	4	False Exploding Plants	Heki Kibaku Kusaki no Jutsu	Descripiton: The user makes a single handseal, before touching any plant. Afterwards, they quickly get away from it, and usually stay away. The next post, the plant will seemingly explode with the force of one exploding note. Min Duration: 2 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 2														
846	5	5	False Life Tree	Heki Ukiyo-ki	Descripiton: This genjutsu requires the user to kneel down and smack the ground, anyone who witnesses this is trapped in the genjutsu. Where the ground was tapped a tree sprouts then grows to massive proportions. Soon the tree is 5 stories tall, seeming to even break through rooftops and shadow the city for those trapped in the genjutsu. While they are under the effects of this genjutsu, they visualize all of their ninjutsu as failing. Katon sputter soon after leaving their mouth, and targetted ninjutsu fly way off course and are quickly given up on.

846	6	1	The Deadly Vetch	Karasunoendou nai no Jutsu	A torture genjutsu that can only be triggered in calm situations. The shinobi places a palm on the target's chest and holds it there to trigger the genjutsu. Once a go, a large plant seems to grow from beneath their palm (Nothing like the vetch of its namesake), and grows 4 massive vines that wrap themselves around the target. Within the first post the plant wraps itself tight enough for a mighty pressure to be felt as it squeezes them. From then on, any post where the user says the word '˜spike', the anywhere the '˜Vetch' is touching will feel like massive spikes are being shoved into the person's body, and then retreating.														
846	6	2	Crippling Vines	Fugu Zairu no Jutsu	After saying, 'Look out behind you,' Four vines sprout up behind anyone who hears the user, gripping their arms and legs. Keeping him still for but a moment, they suddenly sprout out to the area of their tendons, suddenly growing thorns over the tendons. Needless to say, the tendons are severed, making the brain believe that all of the tendons in the arms and legs have been cut, making the opponent become a shuddering statue of pain; soon falling over. After the duration this sensation stops abruptly. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 1														
846	6	3	Eight Vines	Hatsu Zairu no Jutsu	By catching eyes with a single opponent, this genjutsu is triggered. Suddenly, four vines grip the opponent's arms and legs, etc. Four vines sprout from the ground yet again: two dig into the opponent's ears, another repeatedly slaps the opponent on the face, and the final one attempts poorly to dig into their nose.														
846	6	4	False Timber!	Heki Mokuzai!	After yelling the trigger word, "Timber!" (or Mokuzai! for some) any opponent who hear will be caught in the genjutsu. Any trees that are nearby will seem to come down to collapse on the target, the whole forest falling in waves. Being struck by these trees seems real, and every sound and action from the cut of the trees to the disturbance they have on the ground seems to genuine until the genjutsu fades.

846	7	1	Bunny Vetch	Karasunoendou Usagi no Jutsu	A battle ready version of the Vetch, by throwing an object for the target's to see. Everyone who witnesses it is suddenly hit in the chest or back by a small seed that then grows into the large 4 vined Vetch. Unlike the previous jutsu, this one does not require a trigger word to make the spikes release, and every post it will do so at the start of the post, digging unviewed spikes deep into the target's flesh. This genjutsu has the added benefit of causing pure terror in those affected, even if they have previously been affected by the genjutsu.														
846	7	2	Toxic Shock	Dokusei no Jutsu	Triggered by a phrase of choice from the user, The opponents who hear the user feels a sudden tingle in their noses before losing the ability to sniff or even breathe through their nose (or so they think) as a mould has grown there. Then the agony starts, an illusionary pain said to be akin to acid eating at your face. The flesh deteriorates, as does the bone, soon leaving the target(s) front face to just kind of fall off, their eyes still held by the bone, with their brain slowly slipping out. It can work on three targets, max.														
846	7	3	Suffocation	Sanketsu no Jutsu	As the user opens their hand and breathes into it, all opponents who see the action are caught in the trigger. A sensation is felt in the targets throat and lungs as if a powder is caught in it, filling them utterly to the point that taking a breath becomes impossible. This usually causes gasping for air, but to their brain they aren't getting any air. They soon fall to the ground, the brain believing it self to be dead, knocking them out. The post after the duration, they awaken. If they realize this is a Genjutsu, it can be dispelled by a simple Kai regardless, Few people will actually know that, though.

845	1	1	Nature Creation	Etai Souken	Description : Often the first jutsu that academy students of Kusagakure learn, this jutsu allows the user to 'create' a source of Grass or anything in this list that they might require for a jutsu before peforming it. Naturally, this is an incredibly useful jutsu. This can be used to create basic grass in an area and can be used passively on seeds within the user's range, allowing them to grow faster then normal. At first this jutsu creates grass within a 15 feet radius. With higher levels of Ninjutsu Knowledge, this jutsu can be more powerful: stage 2: you can create 30 feet of grass -stage 3: you can create 50 feet of grass --stage 4: you can create 70 feet of grass														
845	1	2	Grass Clone	Kusa Bunshin no Jutsu	Requirement: Control 3, Intelligence 2 This jutsu creates clones from nearby flora, creating patchwork grass clones with grass counterparts to whatever equipment the user is carrying. All these weapons are as strong as their counterparts. Naturally, this cannot copy the special effects of weapons or items. They wouldn't be able to pull out a nice little explovise note of grass. They have the 1/10th the speed and strength of the user, but have 1 Stamina when it comes to defence. A single hit is enough to cause a stalk to untwine and make the whole thing fall into a pile of grass stalks. One clone is created. With higher levels of Grass Ninjutsu knowledge, more clones can be created: Base Stage: you can make 1 clone -stage 2: you can make 3 clones --stage 3: you can make 5 clones ---stage 4: you can make 7 clones														
845	1	3	Grass Minor Wall	Kusa Maina-Hei	Requirement: Power 3, Willpower 2 A quick defensive jutsu. Making a single handseal, this causes a wall made from entangles stalks of grass about three meters tall and three meters wide to rise abruptly from the ground infront of the user. It is thick enough that small glimpses can be seen through it, but besides that it would be hard to see what's going on behind it. One taijutsu hit is usually enough to rip through the wall though and it usually only serves to slow attackers down.														
845	1	4	Grass Needles	Kusa Ni-Doru	Requirement: Intelligence 3, Reserves 3 Description : Either after creating a few small stalks of Grass in their hand or grabbing some from the earth, the user spreads a incredibly small amount of chakra throughout them, usually not even bothering with handseals. Afterwards the grass is thrown towards a target and take on a sharp point during their flight. This makes it possible for the needles to pierce like senbon. 4 Senbon are created with this jutsu.														
845	1	5	Forever Life	Sueshijuu Wakai	Requirement: Power 4, Control 4 Description : This subtle but powerful jutsu creates a passive coat of chakra on all the plant life in a local area. This layer of chakra protects the plant life affected from ninjutsu attacks that would otherwise rip them asunder. Of course, if a ninjutsu stronger/equal then the user's highest Grass Ninjutsu is used then the plant will be effected like normal. Plants can be destroyed by overpowering this jutsu, this is done by using a number of jutsu with stages equal or greater then the highest grass ninjutsu the user has. This effects all plants created by ninjutsu, and effects a 10 foot radius. Base Stage: 10 feet radius in all directions -Stage 2: 20 feet radius in all directions --Stage 3: 30 feet radius in all directions ---Stage 4: 40 feet radius in all directions This does not work on any jutsu that creates a moving creature of plants.

845	2	1	Seed Entangle	Shyushi Karamari	After charging a seed with chakra, it can be flicked at a target. Once it hits, the seed will erupt into long pieces of foilage and constrict movement on that body part by squeezing it tightly. Arms are wrapped tightly, legs constructed. This is highly effective against hands and faces, as it can make it difficult to manipulate the fingers or talk. The seed can be easily torn off by anyone though.														
845	2	2	Spikey Grass Balls	Gosunkugi Kusa Tama	The user Makes a gulp-like motion, as if he was about to spit a loogie. Instead, what comes out are tiny, golf-ball sized green balls, quickly soaring through the air. They fire forward at the enemy. As they go through the air, they can grow up to three times their size, each ball then sprouts several thorn-like mini-spikes on it that can easily rip into the skin as easily as regular metal does. The balls are spit up all in one shot. Base Stage: can spit up 2 Balls -Stage 3: can spit up 4 Balls --Stage 4: can spit up 6 Balls														
845	2	3	Natureâ€™s Clairvoyance	Hinsei no Senrigan	This simple technique allows for amazing recon work to be done within the Kusa-nin's own element. Any plant life can be charged with chakra by this jutsu, making it a perfect guard for the whole thread. The plant in question can sense when another with chakra passes by it, but has no particular facilities to tell anything beyond that. It is also possible to be able to tell exactly how far away from the plant the chakra source is. This jutsu last one thread, but can only be active on one stationary plant at a time. Base Stage: users can sense up to 10 feet away -Stage 3: can sense up to 20 feet away --Stage 4: can sense up to 30 feet away														
845	2	4	Grass Field Annoyance	Kusa Hara Hitonakase	Requirement: Power 7, Control 7, Intelligence 6 Seeping chakra into the ground under them, the user makes a single handseal. Suddenly the grass in the area of effect grows long, grass even growing where there was none, it will even sprout under water to reach past the water's surface up to the battle at hand. The field grows tall enough to brush along the average person's shins. The grass stalks become long and sharp, able to hinder the movement of enemies and give them small cuts. The hold is a weak one that anyone can break out of. Last for 2 post. Base Stage: 10 feet radius -Stage 3: 20 feet radius --Stage 4: 30 feet radius

845	3	1	Root Spear	Tsukene Yari	Requirement: Power 8, Control 8, Reserves 6 Description : The user focuses a small bit of chakra to a single foot before stomping it down on the ground. Roots rise from the ground quickly and violently at a desired location in sight of the user, usually under the opponet's feet. They can be angled diagonally or merely go up straight. The tips are sharpened to a point, making this a useful technique for Genin as it can cause piercing wounds if it manages to strike someone. The spear travels up no further then 3 feet from the ground. Base Stage: The user creates one spear -Stage 4: the user can create a second spear --Stage 5: they can create three spears														
845	3	2	Grass Chain Wrap	Kusa Kusariei	Requirement: Intelligence 8, Tactics 6, Willpower 8 Used as the most basic level of binding technique, the grass chain wrap is started with a seed in one of the user's hands. The seed suddenly burst to reveal a long vine that can be lashed out at a target that is within 5 feet of the user. If the vine gets anywhere near the user, it will extend and attempt to wrap itself around whatever body part it can get ahold of. This holds the two bound and held to the whim of the other, as if one shinobi decides to stay in place during his post, the other shinobi will have trouble moving unless his base strength is higher then the other's stamina, in which case they can pull a resisting shinobi off balance. This wrap last for 3 post.														
845	3	3	Horror Plant	Osore Kusa	Requirement: Power 9, Control 9, Intelligence 7 Description : A terrible jutsu as its namesake suggests. With a single handseal the user causes a small flower to bloom on his head by touching him. As the flower bobs up and down it deposits pollen around the victim's face and once it touches either exposed skin or becomes inhaled the true affect appears. It gives them an intense migraine. A trained shinobi should be able to fight through even a distraction as severe as that, but it is enough to disrupt absolute concentration. The flower has thorns on it, so it may be painful to pull it out, and trying to remove it causes the migraine to worsen considerably. By spending one entire post removing the flower it can be done. Usually sprouting on the forehead where it can dangle down and disrupt the victim's vision, it will fall off after 3 posts if left unattended.														
845	3	4	Plant Weapons	Kusaki Kengeki	Requirement: intelligence 9, tactics 9, Control 7 Description : By grabbing a plant and altering its growth the user is able to make his own weapons. Naturally, all weapons are as deadly as their normal counterparts, but cannot exceed a katana in size. The weapons resume their normal, natural look when they leave the user's hand. While sharp and dangerous, these weapons are rather flimsy if they clash with real weaponry.

845	4	1	Thorn Dragon	Keiryu	Requirement: Power 12, Control 11, Reserves 10, Intelligence 12 The ground before the user rises into a mass roughly six meters across and three meters long. Suddenly, a large winged dragon made of thorns and vines burst forth from the mass with a body 4 meters and a wingspan of almost double that. This fearsome beast is armed with two long pirecing horns, razor sharp claws and a lashing tail that ends in a trio of wicked spikes. Its body and natural weapons are as hard as steel like such dragons of legend though instead of breathing fire this plantlike replica is capable of shooting out huge, two feet long thorns (up to 5 at a time). It lasts three posts. Whenever a katon is used on it, the dragon loses (stage of katon) duration posts, thus a stage four, five, or even seven katon will instantly incinerate it, should it hit. Stage 3 Katon will merely set the thing aflame, and it will be reduced to cinders at the end of the user's next post. Only one may be active at a time.														
845	4	2	Grass Forest Field	Kusa Hayashi Hara	Once again raising a field of grass, the grass begins to grow larger and larger until each strand is almost a meter wide and 2 meters tall. This can be done in a twenty-five meter raidus. The user is able to stand upon the top, allowing him to see all that goes on below him while those inside will have a considerably harder time. This lasts five posts.														
845	4	3	Grass Instant Relocation	Kusa Shunshin	Requirement: Intelligence 14, Tactics 13, Willpower 11, Control 10 Description : Creating several tall roots around around them, the roots suddenly spiral up around the user, removing the user from sight. They suddenly shrink down, disappearing back into the ground. The user then appears in a area of his choice up to a mile away that he has seen before.														
845	4	4	Personal Grove	Jikihi Kodachi	Requirement: Power 15, Control 15, Reserves 13, Intelligence 14, Grass GM Approval Description : One of the higher level Chuunin jutsu for a Kusagakure shinobi, a Shinobi 'inscribes' a part of the forest with their chakra, and can esentially claim it as their 'grove'. Now, by simply slamming a hand on a unrolled kanji-filled scroll, they can summon their grove anywhere. Where it was originally will become a clearing of grass. This grove will be moved to the current battlefield, as if it naturally existed there. When the thread is unsummoned (after the thread) it will regenerate to its original state. The details of the grove must be described in the 'other' section of the character's sheet. Base Stage: The Grove may be up to 15 meters. -Stage 5: The Grove may be up to 20 meters. --Stage 6: The Grove may be up to 30 meters.

845	5	1	Exploding Plants	Kibaku Kusaki	Description : The user makes a single handseal, before touching any plant. Afterwards, they quickly get away from it, and usually stay away. The next post, the plant will explode with the force of two exploding notes.														
845	5	2	Pirahna Plants	Shikon Kusaki	Requirement: Power 18, Control 17, Reserves 17, Tactics 14 Description : A powerful earth-warping jutsu, the first sign of Shikon Kusaki is the ground rumbling beneath a target's feet. After a moment, if the target is standing on natural ground (does not function inside modern non-wooden structures) the earth will split in two to reveal it is being swallowed up by a large venus fly trap that is opening its mouth. The plant's mouth is about 5 feet long, and swiftly opens and rises to attempt to snatch up whatever is above it. Those grabbed when the plant closes its mouth will find they are heavily constructed, not only having trouble breaking free but if left in there for a post bones may even be broken or harmed. Base Effect: Creates 1 Plant for 1 target -Those with Power 25: Can create 2 Plants and take on 2 targets --Power 32: Can create 3 Plants Base Effect: The plant can be escaped with 10 strength -Control 24: The plant can be escaped with 15 strength --Control 31: The plant can be escaped with 20 Strength														
845	5	3	Grass Wilds	Kusa Mikon	Requirement: Intelligence 17, Tactics 16, Willpower 16, Power 15 Description : When this jutsu is used, the nearby plant life begins to collect, roots pulling up to create animal beast. While all of them are no bigger then a large dog, the animals can be everything from squirrels to wolves; coming with teeth and claw. They have the user's physical stats with 1/3 of the Taijutsu Bonuses. They may use Grass Needles, shooting them from the mouth. Finally, if ordered to track something, they will follow it endlessly. The user will know where they are and are alerted if they have located a target.

845	6	1	Ultimate Grass Clone	Kyuukyoku Kusa Bunshin	A more advanced Kusa Bunshin, Only one may be active at a time. Plants are used once again to make this bunshin that is easily recognized as just that. Its body is made up of tightly entwined plants and materials. Unlike most bunshin, this one does not untangle from a single hit, and its plant body will instead be torn apart and bleed out (sap instead of blood). It has the exact Stamina, Strength and Speed of the user, with 2/3rds their Taijutsu bonuses. However, there's an added bonus to this: they're bodies are manipulatable. Naturally, they can't become more then they are, but they are able to turn arms into axes, swords or swords. They can also use a single Grass ninjutsu (except other clones) before disintegrating.														
845	6	2	Defense Grass Counter	Boubi Kusa Tentou	Grass has always had a large dominion of plants and such under their control; but against other elements, it was incredibly weak. Snow would bury it. Earth would rip apart the roots and even the very air it thrived on constantly could turn against it with a simple wave of a hand. A single seed is imbued with a mass of chakra, before being flicked at a target. Fire will not affect the tiny seed, and blades will be devastated by its effect, even after slicing it in two. Once a target has been hit, the seed bursts open to reveal a similar sight akin to Shyushi Karamari (seed entangle), many vines wrapping around the enemy. Normally used to defeat defensive Jutsu, the vines 'search' the armor/skin of the enemy for a weak point before exploiting it. Defenses of stage five and below are affected by this Jutsu, and torn to shreds by prodding thorns born from the seed. Armor likewise, if it hits. But like seed entangle, it can easily be pulled off afterwards.														
845	6	3	Death's Grass	Shibousha Kusa	Requirement: Power 23, Control 23, Reserves 22, Tactics 16, Willpower 15, Grass GM Approval With a wave of their hand, the user causes nearby plant matter to spring into life. Shooting out from the ground or nearby flora, long whip like tendrils quickly wrap themselves around a chosen victim, covering them from their toes to their neck in vines and leaving them bound and hopefully immobilized. On their next post, after a successful capture, the user forms the handseals for the second part of this jutsu; all of the tendrils suddenly grow one millimeter barbs into the enemy's flesh and with a sudden burst of movement all of the vines twist one foot counter clockwise, easily ripping a large portion of skin from the target. Enough to put them in horrible agony and restrict their fighting capabilities. Of course, they can escape this if any of their Physical stats are higher then the user's Power stats. Ninjutsu users whose power is higher than your control may rip through the vines with whatever Jutsu they have at their disposal.

845	7	1	Hell's Cherry Blossom Torrent	Makai Sakura Se	In a way similar to a Wind ninjutsu technique, the user creates several hundred leaves of any type of plant. They are projected into the sky, and the user makes a row of handseals. Suddenly, the leaves begin to spin together in a tornado-like fashion. Quickly, it grows to a size that could easily pick up a house, the hundreds of leaves ripping to shreds anything that is caught in the tornado. Anyone caught in the torrent will find the leaves are at such a velocity that several of them flying at you the same time could slice off a limb, with singular ones going straight in and out. Even if someone was to survive the jutsu, they would find themselves heavily injured. It lasts for two posts, before the wind stops and the leaves fall to the ground. It may only be used once per thread.														
845	7	2	Hidden Pollen	Hitoshirenu Kafun	Requirement: Intelligence 30, Tactics 27, Willpower 26, Power 22, Control 20 The user makes a row of handseals, before thrusting his palms forward. Out comes a thick, yellowish mist that covers the battlefield in a thirty meter radius. This layer of pollen is so thick that it is easily observed as a cloud of dust. It would be hard to even see your hand stretched out in front of you. Naturally, the user may see through this, and is as well immune. The pollen itself, however, is the basis of the jutsu. Anyone inside other then the user will find themselves getting suddenly drowsy. This causes anyone who is caught within to dip in and out of sleep. It lasts for six posts, and two posts of exposure will make one fall asleep for two posts.														
845	7	3	Body of Thorns	Keikyoku no Shitai	A simple idea that has only recently been brought to life. Keikyoku no Shitai begins as the user charges chakra into the seed, which he plants at some point on his body. After the user forms a few handseals, the chakra that feeds the seed will cause it to morph into what first seems to be a body of armor, hard as stone. From the userâ€™s new â€˜backâ€™ will emerge eight black vines that stretch to five meters long, and are equally durable, and have sharpness equal to your average sword. These vines can be controlled by the user's will. It lasts for three posts, and may not be used again in the thread.														
845	7	4	Daffodil	Suisen	The user, putting a seed at some point along an arm of his choice and forming a few handseals can initiate this jutsu. A purely offensive technique, the userâ€™s next task is to force his arm into contact with some point on his targetâ€™s body. Springing to life, the plant bursts from itâ€™s seed in the form of many, many tiny vines that pierce the targetâ€™s skin. While individual vines are sliced rather easily, all must be destroyed to cancel this Jutsu. To do so the target must use a stage seven Ninjutsu or Taijutsu against them. If they do not take these measures, the vines will spread through the targets veins where they pierced and attempt to rupture them, therefore killing them. Preparation takes one post, the attack must be done in the next post. Requires either permission or a death-enabled thread to be used.

844	1	1	Wood Mastery	Moku Seiha	Although Mokuton users usually fight within the forest, near trees, able to use Mokuton Ninjutsu at least a mile in the vicinity of trees; there are certain situations where shinobi must leave their village, and fight in more desolate areas, such as the desert of the Wind Country or the snow of the Snow Country. Because of such difficulty in missions for Mokuton users, this technique was developed. By honing mental skills and developing a bond with the wood element, the user can perform a few handseals, put his hand to the ground, and cause an oak tree to rapidly grow from the ground. As the process is sped up with chakra, it only takes about a minute for it to grow, and it stays alive as long as the user uses chakra around it. This way, Mokuton techniques may still be used.														
844	1	2	Wood Sphere Technique	Moku Tama no Jutsu	This technique is very basic and usually fundamental for genin to use whenever they want to utilize distance combat with their ninjutsu. After performing a couple of handseals, the left hand grabs the right-hand wrist and holds it tightly, the right hand forming a cup. Molding chakra, a large wooden sphere appears in their hand, coated in chakra. This is usually used to toss at an enemy to slow them down or hurt them from afar. When thrown, it has the feeling of someone being hit with a blunt object, usually hurting a bit, but not something that could win a battle. All in all, it's a good technique if the user wants to hurt the enemy from afar or trip them by aiming at the legs.														
844	1	3	Wood Distraction Technique	Moku Meutsuri no Jutsu	This technique isn't really offensive or defensive, but it's true to its name, causing a distraction for the opponent and usually causing their attention to wave and an opening for an attack. The user must be near trees for this to work, and it's usually done behind the opponent. The user channels chakra into the nearby trees, and by choosing a batch of trees, he forces the top of them to shake, as if a powerful wind was forcing them to sway rapidly, but only in one area. As it seems abnormal, many think a more offensive power will rise from the trees, but in reality, all they do is shake.														
844	1	4	Wood Defense	Moku Benso	As Mokuton techniques can be weakened by some elements, being flammable and able to absorb too much weight in water, a sort of protection is needed from such attacks. By passively coating defensive chakra over each technique, Moku Benso allows all Mokuton techniques to develop a sort of resistance. Although they can be burned by Katon jutsu, they will be as easy to burn as flesh is, and won't catch on fire as easily as normal logs. When attacked by a Suiton, they will not become waterlogged unless the user wills them to. Taking this technique is usually fundamental for Mokuton users.

844	2	1	Wood Shuriken Technique	Moku Shuriken no Jutsu	After a small series of handseals, surprise! Wooden Shuriken appear in the user's hand. Usually used when the Mokuton user is short of projectiles, these are equal to shuriken in power, edges sharpened enough to cleanly stab and sometimes rip through flesh, depending on how skilled the user is at throwing projectiles. Base Effect: 2 Shuriken created -Stage 3: 4 Shuriken created --Stage 4: 6 Shuriken created														
844	2	2	Wood Pillar Technique	Moku Chuuseki no Jutsu	This is only used to catch the opponent off guard, but it usually does it in an efficient way. Like all techniques, this does require a few quick handseals to perform. A circular platform of ground below the directed opponent is changed into wood, and raised upwards in about a second, up to only four inches off of the ground, and then instantly dissipates. Because it's such a quick force, it usually lifts the opponent into the air, often flying backwards, but no real harm can be done with this jutsu. It's excellent for opening the chance for more attacks, though.														
844	2	3	Wood Bind Technique	Moku Baindo no Jutsu	The wood bind technique is usually used as a means to trap fast or weak targets in close combat. After seals are performed, the user must lock themselves onto the target, usually by grabbing their wrist or arm. Wherever they grab the target, a wooden bind is connected to the user's hand, robbing the user access to their hand and locking them to the target. This bind last for 2 post.														
844	2	4	Wood Wall Technique	Moku Kabe no Jutsu	Probably the most useful defensive Mokuton technique for genin to use, by performing a set of handseals, a large wall rises above the ground in front of the user. It's a fairly sturdy, large wooden wall, spanning six feet in width and eight in height. Although it can easily be blown over by many upper-level taijutsu and ninjutsu, it can endure stage 1 ninjutsu and 7 strength attacks (without bonuses) without falling. It rises the second the technique is performed, usually reacting quickly enough to block attacks of the level it can stand. After one post, this wall withers away to nothing.

844	3	1	Wood Armor	Moku Yoroi	This is a passive ability that requires no handseals, but does waste a good amount of chakra and takes a long time to learn. In an instant, the user can form a small coating of wood on their body, able to reach two feet in height and width, but they can manipulate the size to their liking. It's usually used to lessen the blow of any sudden attacks that they lack any other defense to block it. Although this can only lessen the blow of stage 2 ninjutsu attacks or 10 strength or more if it's Taijutsu. The user is striking hard wood, so it may hurt their hands when attacking. The armor falls uselessly to the ground after one post.														
844	3	2	Wood Staff Technique	Moku Yakuin no Jutsu	This jutsu allows the user to materialize a sturdy, six foot staff on the ground in front of them. If they lack a sort of defense and are fighting someone else with a weapon, this may be useful, especially due to the reach advantage such a weapon has. It's still made of just a weak ninjutsu, so it can take less damage than an actual staff, snapping easier, but it's handy for varied situations. The user can also take a tree-branch and harden, straighten it so it's just like a staff, and doing this, much less chakra is used.														
844	3	3	Wood Trip Technique	Moku Ensoku no Jutsu	Like the Wood Pillar technique, this Mokuton jutsu allows the user to change a part of the ground into wood, but this time, a sort of sidewalk is formed, directly under the directed opponent. It extends horizontally to the left and the right of the opponent, about six feet long. Suddenly, acting as a conveyer belt, the wood moves to either the left or the right at a much swifter speed than the rising of the wood pillar, tripping the opponent if it's successful, unless they actually expect what's going to happen. Useful for openings.														
844	3	4	Wood Capture Technique	Moku Nottori no Jutsu	A technique used to immobilize the user by capturing them in a way that they cannot move, this involves being bound to the trunk of a tree. The opponent must be near a tree, within seven feet of one for this to work, as a prerequisite. By performing a couple of handseals, bark from each side of the tree shoots outwards, extending to the opponent and curving around him/her. The bark become thickened and extremely stable, and is brought back in attempting to slam the enemy up against the tree, binding them, incapable to movement. Although this technique does no actual damage, it keeps a sturdy hold on the opponent, leaving an opening for an attack. The tree version of Stone Countries' Inner Decapitation technique, in the sense of stopping the enemy from further attacks. This technique lasts for 1 post, and can be broken if the opponent's strength is higher than the user's control.

844	4	1	Wood Clone Technique	Moku Bunshin no Jutsu	One of the most useful and widely-practiced techniques of the style, this technique, after performing one handseal(rabbit), creates a wooden clone of the user. When done, a wooden sculpture appears to step to the side, coming out of the user's body, and then adopts the actual look of the user, looking like a human instead of just a sculpture. This clone has stats equal to 1/3rd the users, including Taijutsu bonuses. Base Effect: 2 Clones are made -Stage 5: 3 Clones are made --Stage 6: 4 Clones are made														
844	4	2	Wood Sculpture Technique	Moku Horimono no Jutsu	By performing a string of four specefic handseals, a wooden sculpture can be made, very miniature, only a little taller than ones foot. These sculptures must resemble a four-legged animal, but the user's imagination can form whatever kind they like. These sculptures are actually alive, although made of wood, and can be commanded to go forwards by the user. They aren't very quick, so this technique is usually used in secret, the animals sneaking around before they approach the opponent. These sculptures have the ability to explode, causing sharp shards of wood to fly in every direction for about five feet until they drop. They have the ability to painfully stab someone, but are nowhere near as destructive as typical bladed weapons. The most these shards do is painfully splinter the enemy, slowing them down. Base Effect: 1 Animal is made -Stage 5: 2 Animals are made --Stage 6: 3 Animals are made														
844	4	3	Element-Proof Technique	Soshi-Ronshou no Jutsu	Moku Benso (Wood Defense) This passive ability is essentially a more powerful version of Moku Benso, heightening the Mokuton's resistance to more overpowering elements. With more and more defensive chakra used into the techniques, if a katon or suiton technique is used against a Mokuton jutsu a level higher than it or more, the wood is unaffected. It may be knocked back a great amount depending on the power, but it will not catch on fire, nor will it be dampened by water. If a katon or suiton is used at the same level or higher, Moku Benso will come into play.														
844	4	4	Wood Dome Technique	Moku Enchou no Jutsu	This technique is a powerful and progressive one. By performing a set of handseals and slamming both hands to the ground, a large wooden dome, about ten feet in height and eight feet in width rapidly rises from the ground. This requires a great amount of chakra to use, and is usually only performed if the user is in dire trouble and wants to elongate the time of the battle. They can't rest while they're inside, they have to keep their hands on the ground for the duration, or else the dome will weaken. However, for the concentration and chakra wasted, this dome can absorb two post of strength 20 (without bonuses) attacks before breaking (in the second post) and the same for stage 3 ninjutsu (and one stage 4 ninjutsu). Each post it is kept up the user loses one use for all other jutsu (in accordance with the jutsu uses). Base Effect: Can be kept up for 2 post -Stage 5: Can be kept up for 3 post --Stage 6: Can be kept up for 4 post														
844	4	5	Wood Slap Technique	Moku Panpan no Jutsu	Another form of sculpting, this Mokuton technique is the most offensive from this stage and below. By performing a string of five handseals, a giant wooden hand sculpture, fingers facing upwards, rises out of the ground. The hand is about 6 feet high and 7 wide. This technique is true to its name, and directly after it's above the ground, the wooden hand, as if an arm was controlling it from below the soil, moves forwards quickly, and ends in a large slap to the ground, intent on crushing the opponent. It is particularly fast, and best used to catch enemies off guard, from behind. It can move a good 15 meters on its own. Base Effect: Can move 15 meters to attack -Stage 5: Can move 20 meters --Stage 6: Can move 25 meters														
844	4	6	Open Slot																
844	5	1	Wood Travel Technique	Moku Ryokou no Jutsu	This is entirely a passive technique, not meant to defend from attacks nor act offensively, but only to get someone places. Although usually used to get around trees and travel high up in a forest, if the user is able to use Mokuton elsewhere, they can. A wooden platform is formed below their feet, and they usually get into a surfing-like standing position. The wooden platform then extends off of the ground, carrying the user wherever they want to go, acting as a sort of extending wooden slide. The user can direct it, allowing the wood to travel in basically any direction as quick as they would be able to run. This wastes little chakra, as it's used to travel large distances, and is mainly to preserve physical energy. Once the user is off this moving platform of wood, it dissipates. Someone could chop the 'slide' down, but the user would most likely just resume it in seconds.														
844	5	2	Wood Protection	Moku Hoko	A nearby tree is required for this technique. The user is able to virtually step inside a tree and out of it, and when they emerge, they look quite different. Their bodies are covered in an encasing armor of wood, forming a sculpture of themselves around them, leaving only holes for eyes to see. The armor is very tough and they can move easily in it, although movements may be slowed due to the extra weight. Can protect against a few slashes from swords with 15 strength or less and 20 from blunt strength. Can withstand at least one attack from stage 4 ninjutsu At least three from stage three Three for stage two as well At least four for stage one														
844	5	3	Wood Pierce Technique	Moku Heki no Jutsu	By performing a few handseals, the user can cause very large wooden yet sharpened spikes to rise out of the ground with the potential to murder someone if connected. Because the edges of the spikes arent smoothed at all, just by being scraped at the side can cause very painful splinters in the skin, and if one connects to a part of the body that isn't fatal, with wood, it'll hurt a great amount. Base Effect: One spike -Power 24: Two Spikes --Power 31: Three Spikes Base Effect: Can originate anywhere within 15 feet -Control 25: 20 feet --Control 32: 25 feet														
844	5	4	Wood Box Technique	Moku Sajiki no Jutsu	Exactly how it sounds, by performing a string of handseals, a gigantic wooden cube rises around the opponent. There is nothing offensive about this technique at all, it's a very durable box, and even stage 5 ninjutsu or 20 strength have difficulty breaking out. It's ten feet in height and twelve in width, and it usually just traps the opponent for the duration of the technique. This only restricts the opponent, and it's best used as a team strategy, allowing others to rest while one uses this technique to hold the enemy back for the time being. If the opponent's willpower + strength or control is higher than the user's willpower + control, they can easily break free. Otherwise, the user spends chakra while he/she maintains the technique. As long as they maintain the seal for the technique and hold still, the box can stay up indefinitly.

844	6	1	Wood Men Technique	Moku Tonogata no Jutsu	Basically a more advanced version of Moku Bunshin, but instead of cloning the user's self, they simply make soldiers made out of wood, devoid of faces or features. These look very simple, like a naked body out of wood, save the anatomical status, no physical features show up, other than sculpted feet and hands. They increase in the Wood Clone's abilities of stamina and speed, and improve on physical power, able to strike effectively. These clones mimic the physical abilities of the user, having the same physical statistics of them, including Taijutsu bonuses. Although they aren't as powerful as the user may be, they make a great defense and are wonderful to use in addition to the user's own attacks. 2 Wood men are made.														
844	6	2	Life Tree	Ukiyo Ki	One of the most astounding techniques in the entire Mokuton list, this summons a gigantic, outstanding tree from the ground, directly in front of the user. This tree is chakra-enhanced, giving it the ability to be used as a haven of safety. In the shade of the tree, all life is protected. Ninjutsu and genjutsu below stage 7 are nullified (all of the user's jutsu are nullified regardless), and physical attacks are significantly weakened, to the point that powerful strikes feel like soft pats on the cheek. Chakra-powered items will be nullified, as well as harmful gases, which will still appear, but no poisonlike affects will take place in the tree's vicinity. Bladed items will be dulled under the tree. It's used as an area of rest and solemnity, something a Mokuton master will use when they are in trouble. As they cannot attack from the area, it's purely defensive. This technique takes a full post to grow, and it is not complete until the beginning of the next post. While the tree is still growing, it can be destroyed by ninjutsu or taijutsu means. This technique has 3 posts duration.														
844	6	3	Wood Toss Technique	Moku Tosu no Jutsu	Moku Chuuseki no Jutsu (Wood Pillar Technique) Like its predecessor, this technique changes a circle of dirt below the opponent into wood, yet the circle is enlarged to a great degree, spanning six more feet in all directions. Once it's turned into wood, the wood rapidly lifts the opponent upwards, like in Moku Chuuseki, but much quicker. This time it lifts the opponent about ten feet in the air and quickly dissipates at that point, usually making the opponent fly upwards a great deal. Although it's usually used for an opening, the fall has the potential to cause great damage if the victim cannot somehow save themselves from the impact.														
844	6	4	Timber!	Mokuzai!	This technique requires the Mokuton user to be in the vicinity of a forest, and the victim to be near many trees. With a couple of handseals, trees can be cut with chakra and collapse onto the opponent. They are all directed to the opponent with chakra, and it all occurs quickly. A very destructive technique. Base Effect: 2 Trees are fell -Willpower 30: 4 Trees are fell --Willpower 37: 6 Trees are fell

844	7	1	Log Rolling Technique	Maruki Atsuen no Jutsu	After about twenty handseal, the user slams both of his hands on the ground, and a gigantic log appears in front of them in a cloud of smoke, appearing to be two-hundred feet wide and fifty feet tall. It is propelled with chakra, rolling quite fast, honing the ability to destroy practically everything in its path, until it's stopped by force. Can only be used once per thread. When summoned, all trees in the area of the log are absorbed into it, making a large clearing. Before the log is created, the user makes the trees shake wildly, in attempt to frighten all animals away that it may harm.														
844	7	2	Sculpture Mastery Technique	Horimono Shuujuku no Jutsu	Moku Horimono no Jutsu (Wood Sculpture Technique) Truly a mastery of sculpting items out of wood, the user can now summon whole buildings from out of the ground. Once they've memorized a certain establishment architecturally, they can mimic the building with this technique, and create anything from a bath house to a normal home to sleep in. Extremely useful for those that enjoy luxuries while travelling. Can only be used once per thread(Even though there would be no need for it to be used any more). This technique lasts for ten hours, as, although a massive technique is neither offensive nor defensive in action. That time is usually used for relaxation.														
844	7	3	Wood Fortress Technique	Moku Toride no Jutsu	The ultimate defense for a Mokuton user, when this is performed, a square, 100 foot wall made up of nothing but sturdy logs raises from the ground, protecting those inside, usually used to protect an area of the village against a fearsome attack. It can defend against all stage 6 ninjutsu and strength 40 and below (without taijutsu bonuses), but higher levels will begin to break through the barriers. Chakra is coated over the walls, hardening it to an extremity, giving it the ability to block all bladed weaponry, the weapon usually breaking before any damage is done. If the weapon is indestructible, they need 30 strength and below to break through. Even then, it's sturdy and can withstand a fair amount of power, but can eventually fall. It's fifty feet in diameter. Can be used once a thread. This technique lasts seven posts.

843	1	1	Manipulate Mixture	Ayatsuri Gomoku	A fundamental technique. Manipulate Mixture is the first thing that any Shinobi Apothecary learns, the capability to infuse a mixture with chakra to cause a vital change. While the technique learned here is used in many other jutsu, it is useful as a jutsu itself for one specific purpose, making any non-poisonous substance potable. What this means is that even a vial full of sewer water can be made as 'nutritious' as normal drinking water. The jutsu will usually make the liquid bubble for a short moment before it suddenly calms.														
843	1	2	Alter Taste	Kougou Ganmi no Jutsu	A simple technique with many different applications. This can make any contained amount of liquid have a taste vastly different from its own after simple handseals. After the jutsu is completed the liquid will glow for just a moment, but then the liquid can take on any taste that the user determines. This can include subtle changes like 'hint of cinnamon', or major changes like 'Apple to orange'.														
843	1	3	Stink Bomb	Shuuki Bakudan	After giving this vial a brisk shake, the contents start to bubble and turn yellowish. The bottle is then thrown and upon shattering it spreads (usually over a 3 foot area) a liquid with a noxious odor, with a smell akin to even the strongest skunk scent. Anything the liquid touches in the very moments it lands are stained with the liquid and its smell, which can persist in clothing for days and even with stern washing, takes a day to clean off a person. A favorite among aspiring Brewmasters.														
843	1	4	Essence of Lugie	Seizui Kushi	The first spitting technique that many Brewers learn, this technique includes swallowing a swig from the appropriate vial before spitting it towards their target. Released from their mouth is a volley of spitballs the size of golf balls, each hardening like stone as they fly towards their target. These are used as a volley of simple projectiles since their rate of movement can bruise or knockout those unaware. 4 solid balls are created but when traveling more than 10 feet away they lose a lot of their velocity.

843	2	1	Red Juice	Aka Shiru no Jutsu	A special tonic used for those that can't learn not to take a hit in a fight. Blood loss is a common problem, leading to fighters growing weaker as a long battle is drawn out and bleeding to death is always a danger. Using an ingredient popper to add a small red leaf to a vial, the bottle's contents quickly turn a thick red and must be ingested immediately. This causes the body to start replenishing blood at a quick rate, staving off the fear of blood loss related symptoms for 5 post. A double dose of the main ingredient can be created to hold off symptoms for an hour (non combat application).														
843	2	2	Healing Salve	Chiyu Nankou no Jutsu	Not a quick jutsu by any means, but those looking for a chance to heal early in their career have this concoction on hand. Popping the correct ingredient and then shaking the vial violently makes it turn into a thick white paste. Smearing this carefully on small scrapes and wounds makes the pain from them quickly forgotten and helps prevent infection.														
843	2	3	Mace Shot	Biransei Funsha no Jutsu	This simple vial is prepared before any battle, by taking a swig of it the user then spits a strong jet of the brownish liquid at their target. If it manages to strike someone in their eyes or along the nose, the liquid's vapors will cause the opponent to tear up uncontrollably. The sensation on the eyes is as if they are on fire, usually causing effective blindness until it clears up the post after the effect starts. Stage Three: The effect last for 2 post Volume Up: The jet of liquid can be made a spray, giving it short range but making it possible to effectively hit multiple targets 5 feet in front of you in a cone 5 feet wide.														
843	2	4	Popper	Keshi	A simple shake starts this Brewmaster brew a bubbling, its contents just a clear liquid that seems to boil and shake. This vial is actually made tougher then most others and instead of breaking upon contact it usually bounces or sticks in place. A moment later the vial's contents expand quickly, causing the glass to erupt so fast that it sends shards in every direction, creating a makeshift and weak shrapnel weapon that will cause small slices and cuts for those caught within the 5 foot blast. Stage Three: Two vials can be prepared fast enough to throw at once. -Stage Four: Three Vials can be prepared fast enough to throw at once. Volume Up: The blast sends the shards up to 10 feet														
843	2	5	Liquid Confidence	Eki Youbou	Description:A patented 'Brewmaster' technique, liquid confidence is a dangerous drink that only apothecary themselves are prepared to undertake. After a seal the user takes a long drink of a purplish brew and instantly their stomach starts to bubble and brew. Nothing happens the post it is taken, the user is merely stuck with an upset stomach. The post afterwards is when it all goes down. Soon their body and mind start to feel dead, the user's vision going slightly fuzzy as their nerves over their body deaden, making pain body-wide forgotten. This effect last for 2 post, but during this duration their speed level is half of what it usually is, their body slow at reacting to incoming danger. Stage Three: 3 Post Duration Stage Four: 4 Post Duration														
843	2	6	Open Slot																
843	3	1	Volume	Maki Maki	This jutsu is a learned process to enhance a vial's contents further with chakra. By doing a certain set of seals, a vial is enhanced, so even techniques that otherwise would not need seals done before them would now need a short set of seals. A jutsu that is enhanced by Volume will have its effects listed after the jutsu itself, but its usual result is an unnatural rise in the content of the vial. Any jutsu that already requires seals will now take even longer to complete and other apothecaries can recognize those particular seals if they have stage three or higher in this list.														
843	3	2	Tester's Immunity	Kousaya no Men'eki	A passive immunity gained from testing lots of different creations that would usually destroy the common man. This allows for drinking immunity to poisons that are ingested directly as long as they would not be lethal. Of course this only offers protection from poison introduced via eating or drinking.														
843	3	3	Healing Vapor	Chiyu Yuge no Jutsu	A creation made to be thrown, this requires the application of a small green leaf and the seeds underneath before the vial begins to react. Once the ingredient is introduced the vial is volatile enough to explode into a cloud of blue dust upon impact, this cloud is barely 3 feet in diameter, but those caught in the center of it will find its effects like a simple ointment, 1st degree burns are healed and coughs or congestion are cleared up immediately. The cloud quickly dissipates the very round of posting that it is used though. Stage Four: Clears up cuts as well Volume Up: The cloud now covers 6 feet of space, which can cover two shinobi close to one another.														
843	3	4	Liquid Key	Eki Kagi no Jutsu	This acidic liquid requires simply dropping another liquid in it using a dropper. The liquid does not seem to react but it is now ready. This potion is actually harmless to humans and animals, opening the bottle you could pour it over your hands or even drink it. But anything else, clothing (a common source of pranks), weapons, walls, all react to it like it is a powerful acid, being eaten away very quickly, able to eat through an inch of material in one post. Sadly the liquid does not explode outwards when its vial is shattered, simply sitting there in a puddle. Commonly the liquid key is taken onto the fingers and applied to walls or doors to burn a hole into them, or opened and splashed towards others to burn away worn armor or equipment. Each application of Liquid Key stays active for only the post it was applied. (Opponent's permission required to use on a person's equipment)

843	4	1	Liquid Happy	Eki Yukai	An experimentation in purposeful inebriation and a Brewmaster favorite, Liquid Happy is a concoction that requires special care. A set of handseals divert chakra to a dark blue vial, the vial seems to quickly turn a brighter blue. The user then must guzzle it quickly before the reaction is over. While it has no effect that post, next post a powerful feeling of euphoria will take over the user, making them feel tingly all over and regardless of their usual demeanor will make them rather jovial. This forced triggering of joy has only one true positive effect, any other attempts to change the mood of the inebriated must be stronger than the Chakra generated signals to their brain. This blocks emotional changes brought on by genjutsu stage four or below.														
843	4	2	Loosen	Basa Basa	A healing potion that is simply shaken before it is thrown, this green liquid burst into a cloud of smoke upon impact. Anyone who inhales the green cloud is subjected to an artificial stimulation of their nerves and muscles, causing a momentary discomfort of the muscles but also removes any temporary paralysis caused by a jutsu stage 4 or lower that may be inhibiting their movement. This of course does not stop a genjutsu from making a person believe that they cannot move. The cloud is about 4 feet in diameter. Stage Five: Removes paralysis from up to stage 5 Stage Six: Removes up to stage 6 Volume Up: The cloud is now 12 feet in diameter, making it large enough to effect several shinobi.														
843	4	3	Soothing Wave	Ibu Nami no Jutsu	By applying a small blue berry to a particular potion it turns into an opaque white liquid. Upon being thrown the vial it is in will burst into a large white cloud that is never thick enough to truly be much more then a few seconds of distraction. Anyone who inhales the contents of this cloud has their senses cleared, dissolving common irritants and blockers from the eyes, ears, nasal passage, and renewing the sense of taste and touch by destroying common neural inhibitors. This rather large cloud can be up to 20 feet wide but of course works on anyone in the field. This cloud fades by the user's next post.														
843	4	4	Irritant Field	Biransei Hara	This jutsu merely uses handseals to create the dangerous reaction within, the putrid brown liquid vial thrown shatters in a splash that reaches 15 feet in radius. While not seeming to cause any effect, Doujutsu that can see chakra will easily pick up the chakra permeating the ground the liquid fell on. Anyone who moves within the area effected besides the apothecary themselves will find themselves under attack, their eyes will start to water and they will find it difficult to breath as the gas in the air tries to close up their throat. Even their skin will begin to itch. Merely moving out of the area affected is enough to clear up the effects. The field itself clears up after 4 post. Stage Five: The effects last for one post after leaving the area. -Stage Six: The effect last for two post after leaving the area. Volume Up: The field is now 30 feet in radius.

843	5	1	Great Escape	Ko Toubou no Jutsu	A pseudo-explosive that is commonly used to escape a battle, but can be used to take away the advantage of others. This bottle caked in black does not need to be shaken or anything in preparation, but once it is thrown (hopefully clear of the user) it creates a loud disorienting bang as the vial explodes high into the air with black soot. Wave after wave of black muck falls from the sky over an area of 20 feet. Those within the area are literally covered in the falling material, piles of it falling onto them that quickly turn into little piles upon their clothing. The rain of muck clouds vision like just like any cloud, but unlike a simple cloud the falling material is too heavy to be blown away by wind. Those within the area of the rain will also find that their heat or night vision will quickly be covered, making the lens stop working properly (Those outside the area can look into the area just fine). Techniques made to look into clouds of smoke or fog also do not function to see into this rain of muck. This rain last for 2 post, leaving a layer of black gunk over the ground in the area. 17 Control: Last for 2 post -24 Control : Last for 3 post --31 Control : Last for 4 post Volume Up: The area of the cloud is now 40 feet														
843	5	2	Foam Bomb	Awa Bakudan	A potion used for blocking or defensive purposes. This vial when thrown explodes directly opposite of the surface it lands on. The contents turn into a bubbly rush that covers things that are close or rises into something resembling a column without an object to grab. Commonly this is done by throwing the vial straight down and letting it cover the user in a shallow cocoon or letting it rise into a wall. The wall then solidifies, becoming harder than simple rock. This wall is strong enough to block strength up to level 5 and jutsu up to stage 4. The user's next post and after the cocoon can be broken with as little as level 1 strength and any offensive jutsu so those trapped in it may escape. (Alternatively this can be used to defend another by making the vial break near them or to hold another single person in place if you manage to hit them with the vial)														
843	5	3	Mending Wind	Chiyu Kaze no Jutsu	A powerful cloud of healing energy imbued into a liquid, this vial requires a small nut to be plugged into it before use, but after the dropper has been entered the vial is thrown and when it smashes open a large plume of blue vapors will rise up and overtake those within 15 feet. Everyone within the cloud will feel the mending chakra in the field flowing over them. It only hangs in the air for a post, but it removes small scrapes, cuts, bruises, 1st degree burns and assist in the healing of coughs and colds.														
843	5	4	False Panacea	Heki Mannouyaku no Jutsu	The Panacea is the holy grail of potions, the most powerful elixir, able to heal anything and everything. But... it is still a goal out of reach. By using an ingredient puncher to add a mix of herbs to a vial of clear liquid, the bottle quickly goes dark crimson from the noxious drink inside. It must be ingested by the intended target within moments of this reaction. For their post (or their next post if the Apothecary drinks it) their wounds begin to instantly heal, bones mend like magic, energy replenished, they feel like all of their woes are gone. But this effect only last for 2 post after. After the potions effect has worn off the user's wounds open fresh, their bones fracture and they collapse, regardless of their condition before they are totally drained of their energy as they collapse into a pile of their own red spit.

843	6	1	Essence of Web	Amimono no Seizui	Shaken vigorously and then thrown, wherever this vial of white liquid shatters, exploding outward like a bubble being popped, it covers nearby things in a material akin to super glue. It has been found to have trouble sticking to soil and plants, but sticking skin to skin or skin to man made objects it has no problem with. Many test subjects have considered the sticky fluid to be harmless... until they tried to make handseals and found their hands glued together. The fluid covers only the area directly around where it lands and it takes strength level 6 to pull glued objects apart, though skin or clothing will quickly come away with it. The fluid hardens over 2 post before falling away harmlessly. The vial only covers about 1 foot of space where it lands.														
843	6	2	Liquid CouRAGE!	ekieiki	Another attempt at purposeful inebriation, this bubbling red liquid is imbibed one post and the effects come the next. The user is overwhelmed with rage and killing instinct, while they are not inherently violent to anyone they see, people they consider threats illicit an uncanny response. The primary effect is that they ignore common sense and drive straight towards their targets to attack, fooling their 'mind' into believing that this cannot be achieved is ineffective as they have effectively taken reasoning away from their own mind. While they may believe they cannot walk any further, their body will attempt it anyway and will find success. While this tonic is in effect users have reported having literal tunnel vision, their eyesight limited and foggy. If there are no 'threats' visible during their post the Brewmaster will feel inclined to attack the thing they find most threatening (even if this is a teammate). Genjutsu effects that limit movement are ignored for the duration (Though any other part of the genjutsu works fine). This effect last for 2 post normally, usually ending in a burp that clears the conditions from the body.														
843	6	3	Burning Cloud	Kumo Nenshou	A dangerous liquid as much as a dangerous attack, mixing a small dried leaf using a dropper then making a single seal, this clear liquid turns bright red and becomes warm enough to even burn the Apothecary should they take too long to get rid of it. The bottle explodes of its own volition mere seconds later, but shattering it will do the trick as well. A reddish cloud rushes from where it breaks, a mess that smells acidic like rotten fruits. Those caught within the 40ft explosion of dust will find themselves assaulted, everything exposed seeming to burn and warp. Clothing and armor starts to melt away in red lines and skin starts to warp or char as if being burned. Momentary exposure can cause burns here and there on the skin, being exposed for a whole post is enough to horrifically scar someone's appearance and hamper their health and surroundings are scarred or melted away including trees and walls. Volume Up: After the initial explosion the cloud now hangs in the air for another post.														
843	6	4	The Last One	Saigo-Ichi	An explosive technique that does not use any one vial in particular, but their rather volatile mixtures. By stringing several seals together, all of the vials along their belt begin to glow white in a way that is hard to ignore. Not moments later all of the vials will explode, sending out a wave of glass shards with them. The explosion is usually strong enough to blow massive holes in walls and leave huge dents in the earth, it is easily powerful enough to envelope and destroy the Brewmaster that uses it. The only way to escape such a fate is through use of a bunshin or throwing the belt just after creating the seals.

843	7	1	Golden Formula	Kin Shiki no Jutsu	Any technique from this list can be enhanced in this way before use with a simple series of handseals, making the seals for a technique that already requires them twice as long. This makes it so that the potion or concoction also has the healing properties of Chiyute through-out the system of those hit. If it is ingested then it will heal internal injuries and mend simple bone fractures, if it is a cloud or similar then it will mend the outside wounds of those within the area of effect. This obviously does not do much with techniques that would themselves cause harm. Making a technique a 'golden formula' does count as using the jutsu 'golden formula' for the sake of jutsu uses.														
843	7	2	The Taste of Death	Oujou no Ganmi	Potions more often then not can also become deadly poisons, this technique aims to prove that. By performing a series of handseals before using a technique from this list (or performing extra seals) this introduces a poisonous mixture of chakra to any technique that is being used. Any concoction effected this way is poisonous by mere contact with the mixture, whether through cloud or objects created from it. This poison greatly weakens those affected, bringing on chills after one post, destroying senses the post after till the sense of sight is no more then moving blobs. This does not kill right away, but if no healing is supplied (by any medical personal with shinobi medicine) within the next day the target's heart will succumb.														
843	7	3	That ****ing Creation	Sore-Kutabacchimae-Souken	This is a creation that many Brewmasters refuse to teach about and many more refuse to even carry with them when they know it. A post worth of seals makes a particular vial on their belt turn black. Two post after this the vial does what is usually described simply as 'cataclysm', this cannot be stopped by the user after they have done the initial seals and even breaking the vial and scattering the liquid will only a make a weaker and more widespread disaster. The vial explodes with a grey cloud, in no small way, weak buildings will be leveled along with their neighbors, stronger buildings will collapse, whole swaths of forest are eaten alive and left blackened heaps. This is not from the explosion itself, but the chemical from the explosion eats through everything in its path in mere seconds, leaving no trace of what was once there. The explosion sends the chemical created as far as 65 feet in every direction.

843	8	1	True Panacea	Junsui Mannouyaku no Jutsu	The True Panacea is a miracle, including purest ingredients and great works of chakra in one small vial only enough to work on one target. This is the only 'true' mastery of Apothecary techniques and takes generations to accomplish. This clear liquid always seems to bubble with sparkling light but over a matter of the 2 weeks after its creation the chakra within it will slowly fade unless more chakra is poured in by someone who knows this technique. The True Panacea is able to cure all ailments of man, any human being who is given the dosage of this potion will have all wounds cured, even old scars both internal and external. The one thing it cannot cure is death, something outside the realm of mortal science.														
842	1	1	All Directions	Shihouhapou	Trigger: The opponent must see the user's handseals. This technique distorts the hearing of an opponent, causing whatever sound the user makes to appear to be coming from every direction. Shihouhapou is commonly used to confuse the target concerning his foe's location, or to intimidate one's adversary by convincing him that he is surrounded. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 6														
842	1	2	Depth Distortion	Okuyuki Katawa	Trigger: Eye contact between target and user. This technique affects the depth perception of a target, distorting it so they are unable to accurately judge the distance between themselves and an object. For example, an opponent under the influence of this technique would have trouble determining the speed of an incoming projectile, or may misjudge a quarry's position as being further away. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 6														
842	1	3	Static	Kuuden	Trigger: The target must hear the user say the technique name. Kuuden targets the sense of hearing of a foe by forcing the sound of static in his ears, making it difficult for one suffering from this affliction to hear sounds over the annoying noise. Often used to hamper communication between foes, as well as a distraction. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 6														
842	1	4	Closed Sight	Shimaru Shikaku	Trigger: Eye contact between target and user. This technique targets the peripheral vision of the target by reducing his range of vision from 160 degrees to 60 degrees, essentially causing them to see only what is directly in front of their eyes. Due to this, the afflicted will find themselves unable to register attacks coming from either flank, and will in turn also find targeting foes for attack more difficult than normal.

842	1	6	Open Slot																
842	2	1	Through the Looking Glass	Kugurinukeru Meikyou	Trigger: The target must see the user's handseals. With a few hand seals, the user shatters their opponent's vision. For the duration of the technique, the target will see the world as if they were looking through a pane of broken glass. This type of compound vision tends to make it a lot harder to decide exactly where something is by presenting a multitude of images and if nothing else, it is extremely annoying although inherently dangerous. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
842	2	2	Location Distortion	Basho Katawa	Trigger: Eye contact between target and user. This simple technique shifts the target's perceptions of the world two feet forwards and two feet to the left. While they are affected they will believe that they just pass right through whatever they try to touch like a ghost trying to make contact with the real world. Basho Katawa works best if people just ignore the target but any sort of forceful contact upon the target will snap him out of this state. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
842	2	3	Whisper Technique	Mimiuchi no Jutsu	Trigger: The user must be looking at the opponent's body. The user can create a sound or a word (not a full sentence) and direct it to the target, so only the target can hear it, inside his mind, while thinking the sound comes from right next to him. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
842	2	4	Illusion Bell Needles	Suzu Senbon no Genkaku	Trigger: The opponent must hear the bell sounds. A technique that uses special bells attached to throwing needles. The bells ring at a certain frequency and the sound directly affects the brain. Disorientation immediately hits the opponent during this thread, where the opponent sees everything in blurs and multiples. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5

842	2	6	Open Slot																
842	3	1	Pantomime	Mokugeki	Trigger: The target must hear the user say the technique name. For the duration of the technique the target will believe they are trapped in a small, invisible and soundproof box. They will be granted the full abilities of a mime and as such they can trace the walls, bang on the sides, and scream without making a sound, and with perfect accuracy. The technique is dispelled if anything enters the box. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
842	3	2	Chained Mind Technique	Atama Kusari No Jutsu	Trigger: The opponent must watch the hand movements. This technique uses intricate hand movements and subtle chakra waves to render the target hypnotized and incapable of movement. The target is required see the user's hands or the technique will not take effect. This effect will only last as long as the shinobi continues to perform the hand movements and the target can see the his hands. As long as the hand movements are performed, both sides are rendered immobile. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
842	3	3	Forgetfulness Technique	Kenbou no Jutsu	Trigger: Eye contact between opponent and user. When invoked, Kebou no Jutsu allows the user to cause the afflicted forget one Ninjutsu or one Genjutsu technique of the user's choice for the duration of the technique. However, he must have seen the target perform the technique in the past (either earlier in the current thread, or in a previous encounter). The victim's memory returns to normal following the end of the thread. This technique can only be used once per thread. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 3 Max Duration: 5														
842	3	4	Voice of Compromise	Jouho no Koe	Trigger: The opponent must hear the voice of the user. The user focuses a small amount of chakra into his vocal chords as he speaks, allowing it to escape with his voice. While using this technique, anything the user says will be perceived by listeners as a positive message. Jouho no Koe can have numerous effects, such as endearing the speaker to his audience. It tends to have very little effect on established enemies, or people in a high state of emotion, although it has been known to calm down agitated people.

842	4	1	Painful Ringing Technique	Itai Kanetsuki no Jutsu	Trigger: The opponent must hear the bell sounds. This technique is performed in exactly the same way as the Suzu Senbon no Genkaku. However, instead of causing nausea and vertigo, it progressively causes more pain as long as the target listens to the sounds of the bells. On the first post, the pain is nothing more than an annoying headache; the second post is on par with a serious migraine; the third post is incredibly, throbbingly painful. On the fourth post and up the target is usually unconscious. To stop Itai Kanetsuki no Jutsu, the target must either disrupt the user's concentration, destroy the bells or endure it. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
842	4	2	Inflict Emotion Technique	Ataeru Kanjoo no Jutsu	Trigger: The opponent must see the handseals. This technique allows the shinobi to temporarily change the emotions of the target to his liking. The emotions imparted can be anything from ecstasy, despair, overconfidence, grief, etc. After the effects have passed, the victim remembers the one who used the technique, and almost always with hostility. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
842	4	3	Brain Massage	Nouzui Momiryouji	Trigger: The target must hear the user say the technique name. Through sound hypnosis and a form of Himei no jutsu, the user can make the opponent see and feels many hands and arms come and wrap themselves around the opponent's head. This is able to bind him/her in place as intense numbness activates. Although the opponent is not actually bound, it is usually because the opponent's body feels numb and is under genjutsu that he feels he is numb. The opponent can still move, but only if the opponent can get his mind through the numbness. Even then, the opponent is slowed down considerably. Min Duration: 1 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
842	4	4	Voice of Persuasion	Tokitsukeru no Koe	Trigger: The target must hear the user's voice. Tokitsukeru no Koe applies all the effects of Jouho no Koe at a heightened level. In addition, the user can now make requests to his listeners and, assuming they are not too unreasonable, they will be favourably considered. However, this technique is still limited in its level of influence; for example, someone using this technique may be able to convince an enemy to retreat, but probably not to surrender. Also, the technique remains much less effective against impassioned people, especially if the anger is directed at the user. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3

842	5	1	Beat Motion	Kodou Dousa	Trigger: The target must touch the opponent. By subtly altering the way the target's brain interprets sound, a ninja who uses this technique can cause their opponents to twitch or convulse at every sound they hear. Most sound at normal volume levels - footsteps, someone coughing - will cause slight and nearly unnoticeable twitches in the target. Louder sounds like clashing steel or someone shouting will cause a momentary spasm, usually in the arm or leg muscles. Extremely loud sounds like an explosion or someone raking their nails down a chalkboard will cause the target to collapse and shudder momentarily. Anything in the upper echelons of human hearing (say, 150 decibels) would cause violent and nearly bone breaking convulsions and if anything this loud was maintained for more than two posts the target would surely break their own back. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
842	5	2	Emotional Suppression	Kin'atsu no Shujouteki	Trigger: The opponent must hear the user say the technique name. This technique affects the mind of the target, rendering them numb of feeling and void of emotion. This skill is typically used to calm one's own emotional panic, or to play havoc on the minds of a foe's allies. However, this skill has also been known to be used an effective tool against emotionally driven opponents. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
842	5	3	Shroud of Darkness	Kurayami no Oii	Trigger: The opponent must see the handseals. Kurayami no Oii calls into being a sheet of inky darkness over an area of roughly five hundred square yards in length and 40 yards in height. This mass of darkness cancels all forms of natural light, causing the area to become a perfect inky black, rendering individuals inside the affected area blind by the complete lack of light. However, the creator of the shroud is able to see clearly and unhindered. An active doujutsu can see through the darkness of the shroud, and the shroud is dispelled if any form of attack strikes the user. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 4														
842	5	4	Voice of Influence	Eikyou no Koe	Trigger: The target must see the handseals as well as hear the name of the technique. The scope of commands or requests, compared to Tokitsukeru no Koe, that the user can make has broadened considerably. For example, team members that have not worked together for long could easily be made to fight each other. It takes quite a high amount of resistance on the part of the victim to overcome the effects of the technique. Eikyou no Koe lasts as long as the user remains speaking, but it cannot remain effective for more than three posts. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3

842	6	1	Dampen	Sameru	Trigger: None. A rather unique technique that focuses the illusion on the user rather than on the opponent. Sameru disrupts the user's brain signals, causing the nerve endings of the user to become less effective. As a result, the user is able to block out pain much easier. However, this dampening of the nerve endings is a double edged sword, as it can make discerning the amount of damage taken very difficult, and also greatly hampers the user's fine motor functions. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3														
842	6	2	Bringer of Darkness Technique	Kokuangyo No Jutsu	Trigger: Eye contact must be made. This Genjutsu adversely affects the portion of the victim's brain that regulates vision. While the brain is disrupted, the victim is effectively rendered blind. Also, due to the fact that the darkness is brought about through an affliction of the user's own mind, rather than eyes, doujutsu users are not immune to this particular form of blindness. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3														
842	6	3	Numbness	Shibirekan	Trigger: The target must hear the technique name. Similar to the technique Sameru, this technique weakens the brain's connection with nerve endings. Unlike Sameru, Shibirekan targets others rather than the user. As a result, the victim finds his fine motor functions lacking, and the act of running can become a real burden. However, the victim's own sense of pain is also hampered, therefore allowing them to concentrate through wounds that would normally make rational thought difficult; though this also can cause the victim to misjudge the severity of his own wounds. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 2 Max Duration: 3														
842	6	4	Voice of Command	Kamei no Koe	Trigger: The target must see the handseals as well as hear the name of the technique. Anyone using this technique is quite skilled at manipulation. Using the same process as in earlier stages, the user may make requests, suggestions, or even give orders to their listeners. These listeners hear the user's voice as a pleasant, well-spoken voice and rational, and anyone who speaks against the user sound harsh and crude. The listeners may even begin to feel hostility toward such people. However powerful the effects, though, they will still wear off after a period of time. Manipulation-wise, opponents will only hear the user's voice as a very strong suggestion. While the user may sound quite persuasive, this does not guarantee any sort of requirement to follow orders. The most that happens is the pleasant and rational sound of the user's voice. Anything beyond that is up to the victim. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 3

842	7	1	Nausea	Hakike	Trigger: The target must see the handseals. This technique affects the target's sense of smell. By shutting down all but the most unpleasant of the nose's regions of scent, this technique effectively overloads the foe's brain with rancid, rotting, and generally unbearable smells. Due to the utter strength of the smells perceived, it is not uncommon for even those with the strongest of stomachs to begin vomiting uncontrollably, and combat is in all cases greatly hampered by the overwhelming feeling of sickness that now dominates their body. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 3														
842	7	2	Voice of Terror	Kyoufu no Koe	Trigger: Eye contact must be made as well as hearing the user's voice. The user begins to take his vocalization skills down a different path in this technique. Kyoufu no Koe employs a combination of the concepts of Kamei no Koe and many other visual Genjutsu. The user begins to tell a story, while keeping eye contact with the target. As long as the contact is held, the victim sees and feels himself acting out the events of the story. The victim is not actually acting out anything, however. Instead, he just stands perfectly still, listening to the story. This technique may also be used on someone who is asleep, not requiring eye contact in this case. While asleep, the victim begins to dream the scenario that the user narrates. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 3														
842	7	3	Amplify	Fuyasu	Trigger: Eye contact must be made and the name of the technique must be heard. This rather insidious Genjutsu greatly distorts the hearing of the target, causing them to hear all sounds in roughly 150 decibels. When under the affects of this technique, even the most simple of sounds, such as the scrapping of your finger against a kunai, can become unbearably loud and painful. The user is almost certainly left disoriented for a short amount of time. Min Duration: 0 Base Duration: 1 Max Duration: 3														
842	7	4	Voice of Domination	Seiha no Koe	Trigger: Eye contact must be made and the name of the technique must be heard. At this level, the user is incredibly skilled in the art of vocal manipulation, as well as persuasive speech. Anyone listening to the user while he is using this technique, would instantly feel that whatever he says is true, and that they absolutely agree with him. A charging enemy will stop dead in his tracks, just to listen to the wonderful sound of the speaker's voice. Oddly enough, it is more difficult to make an enemy retreat than to make him join your cause. Enemies ordered to retreat will often begin to weep and beg the user to let them stay. However, a listener will carry out nearly any request short of killing himself, or harming something very dear to him. This can only be used once a thread and opponent permission needed.

842	8	1	The Emperor's Voice	Gyokuon	Trigger: Eye contact, name of the technique, and touch. Gyokuon is the ultimate realization of vocal technique potential. The user, by appealing to logic, emotions, morals, or any other mental filters of the victim, can weave complete fantasies and force the victim to accept them as true, no matter how absurd they are. A user could convince someone that the sky is yellow; the happiest man on earth could be made to detest his life; the most worthless being made to think that his life has a great meaning. The most frightening aspect of this technique is its longevity. The victim typically goes on believing what he was told for several months or even years. It could even last until the end of one's life.														
841	1	1	Shout Technique	Issei no Jutsu	By focusing chakra into the vocal chords, the user may amplify his or her voice. This may serve many purposes, such as suddenly giving off a loud cry to startle or distract enemies. It also might be useful to give off your location to allies, although any enemies in the area may overhear as well.														
841	1	2	Noise Technique	Hibiki no Jutsu	This jutsu sends a small sound wave off in any direction, for about 20 feet. Upon reaching its destination, it dissipates, giving a small noise similar to crunching leaves or snapping twigs. It can be quite useful to distract the enemy for a decisive moment, or to lure him away from a certain area.														
841	1	3	Pulse	Myaku	Using a minor amount of chakra to strengthen their lungs, the user can release a ball of compacted air that travels quickly up to 15 feet. When the ball impacts something, it hits with force equal to the user's punch. This jutsu is used to teach the basics of air manipulation. Base Effect: Force of the technique is half of the user's strength (scaled appropriate level). Stage Two Effect: Force of the technique is Ã‚Â¾ of the user's strength (scaled appropriate level). Stage Three Effect: Force of the technique is equal to the user's strength (scaled to appropriate level).														
841	1	4	Whistle	Yobiko	Unlike Shout, this jutsu actually imbues sound waves with chakra. At this level of skill, the user is only able to affect a very narrow range of frequencies, the frequency of a whistle just happening to fall in that range. The user manipulates the wave, increasing amplitude and frequency slightly, in order to make the whistle unusually loud and piercing. This jutsu is usually used to teach the basics of sound manipulation.														
841	1	5	Echo	Zankyou	With slight chakra manipulation, the user is able to cause his or her voice (or other nearby sounds) to bounce off solid surfaces. This can be effectively mask the user's exact location, or to just confuse the opponent.														
841	1	6	Quiet	Shizumaru	By releasing a small amount of chakra around himself, the user is able to slightly dampen any sounds given off in the area around him (	20 foot radius). This technique is highly effective for sneaking up on an unaware enemy. However, Shizumaru does not block out all sound. If an enemy is alert, he will most likely still hear the user's movement.													
841	2	1	Wind Needles Technique	Kaze Senbon no Jutsu	This jutsu uses low frequency (below 20 Hz) sound waves to manipulate air particles. It increases the density of the air around the user's hand into several small air pockets and then fires these pockets at high velocity toward a certain target. The wind is usually formed on top of the user's finger and shot at will. It can be shot with dozens at the same time, and do not have to move in a straight line. However it is easier to spot than most needles due to the vacuum of air that it creates and lets the opponent see it. Base Effect: Up to a dozen needles can be crafted. Stage Three Effect: Up to two dozen needles. Stage Four Effect: The needles are now slightly more transparent and harder to detect.														
841	2	2	Balance Destroy	Kinsei Hakai	This jutsu grants the ability to control sound with chakra and direct it into the opponent's ears. This causes somewhat of a disturbance in the eardrums. This causes the opponent to lose his or her balance over the period of their next post. However, the jutsu must be done at a fairly close range (no more than 10 feet) since the effects of sound dissipate over distance.														
841	2	3	Finger Spike Technique	Yubi Kausi No Jutsu	The user's fingernails grow ten inches long and become quite sharp. They can then be used as slashing and cutting weapons in close combat. However, the nails are not yet strong enough to be used to block heavier weapons such as swords. Base Effect: Nails may grow up to ten inches and are brittle enough to break with your bare hands. Stage Three Effect: Nails may grow up to ten inches and are now of sturdy enough to withstand as much punishment as sheet metal. Stage Four Effect: Nails may grow up to fifteen inches.														
841	2	4	Wave Palm	Onpa no Tenohira	The user transmits chakra to his palm, causing the surface of the hand to vibrate. He or she then attempts to strike the enemy with the open palm. Should the attack hit, it would cause little to no physical damage, however the vibrations work their way into the enemy's nerves, causing a great deal of local pain at the spot struck.														
841	2	5	Harmony: Boom	Onchou: Boutou	Onchou: Boutou gathers chakra in the vocal cords of the user, and subsequently releases it as a ball of sound. The ball is roughly the size of a baseball, and also as devastating. However, the ball loses cohesion over distance, and loses the ability to do harm to the target after 20 feet of travel.														
841	2	6	Hell's Ears	Jigoku no Mimi	By concentrating chakra into the ears, the user is able to detect exact details of movement by the means of sound. This requires extreme concentration, and therefore user must close his eyes in order for Jigoku no Mimi to work as intended.														
841	3	1	Air Cutter	Zankuuha	This technique gives one the basic ability to control his or her Arm Cannons. The user focuses chakra into the barrels implanted in their arms and then releases it with a blast. A high powered gust of wind then explodes from the user's palms, knocking nearly anything down in its path. Its range at this stage is limited to about 20 feet in any given direction (linear). Base Effect: Strength of the blast is equal to the user's Power stat as scaled appropriately with Strength. Stage Four Effect: Strength of the blast is equal to the user's Power stat +10 as scaled appropriately with Strength. Stage Five Effect: Strength of the blast is equal to the user's Power stat +15 as scaled appropriately with Strength. Range of the Zankuuha increases to 30 feet.														
841	3	2	Sound Effect Technique	Koukaon no Jutsu	Using the Cannon and Glove in tangent, the user can create a sound effect of choice. The effect might be the sound of an explosion, an animal roaring, footsteps, etc., but cannot be a human voice speaking in sentences; the sound has to be simple.														
841	3	3	Wind harpoon	Kaze no Sen	This jutsu is an upgrade of the technique Kaze Senbon. However, instead of shooting out multiple smaller needles, the user fires a large harpoon made of air from his/her palm. Base Effect: Only a single harpoon may be made. Stage Four Effect: Two harpoons may be made. Stage Five Effect: Any harpoons made have the ability to pierce clean through defensive techniques Stage 4 and below.														
841	3	4	Vibrating Sound Drill	Kyoumeisen	A Ninjutsu technique in which the ninja uses sound waves above one hundred and fifty megahertz to disorient an opponent by attacking their inner ear, causing dizziness and sometimes sickness of the stomach. In some cases, damage to the eardrum can occur, creating a long-lasting advantage in battle. The sound is produced by a multi-toned metallic plate worn across the ninja's forearm, which, when tapped, can produce devastating vibrations. The attacking ninja takes a swing at their opponent intending to be dodged. Once the plate is directed towards the opponent, it is tapped, producing sound waves that the ninja then manipulates with chakra, guiding it to the ear drum of their opponent. Because of its devastating potency, the range of the sound waves of this technique have a range of 5 feet. Base Effect: The opponent suffers from dizziness during the next two posts. Stage Four Effect: On top of the previous effect, the opponent suffers from sickness on the third post (may extend to such things as vomiting or violent stomach aches). Stage Five Effect: Occurring before the previous two effects, the opponents orientation is so debilitated that they are paralyzed for a single post. Required Player Approval to use. If this effect is rejected, the sickness effect lasts an additional post (2 posts dizziness, 2 posts sickness).														
841	3	5	Voice: Angel	Onsei: Tenshi	Onsei: Tenshi focuses on using the voice to cause vibrations and sustain them by holding out a long, tremulous note. The voice that comes forth is heavenly, and soothes all that hear it. However, the sound of this technique must be directed towards one person only, for if it is allowed to spread, the power will weaken and it will not have its full effect. The soothing affect of Onsei: Tenshi lowers the reaction time of the person who hears it, sending them into a mentally relaxed state not different to being drunk for the duration of one post.														
841	3	6	Dissonance: Yell	Fukyouwaon: Wamekigoe	Wamekigoe is much higher pitched than Unari, and is also sung in a minor key to give it a sense of discord. All beings within 10 feet of the user are affected by the force of this attack, whether they are friend or foe. The scream that is emitted is just below the human threshold for sound tolerance, and extreme discomfort is felt by all those who fall within the radius of the effect. Those who hear this scream often cringe as they are stunned by the magnitude of the sound, and more often than not seek to find a way to block the noise from their ears.														
841	4	1	Finger Spike Bullet Technique	Yubi Kasui Teppoudama No Jutsu	The normal finger dagger technique must be learned before you are able to learn this upgraded technique. These nails can be used in close combat but can also be fired off in high speed from the user's fingertips. The user may freely choose how many he/she wants to shoot and can grow new nails if needed. Note: The durability of these nails rely on the Stage Effect of Yubi Kausi no Jutsu. If the Stage Five Effect is used, this too counts as using a Stage 5 technique.														
841	4	2	VHF - Very High Frequency Wave	Mirimeetoruha	By exercising further chakra control, the user is able to tighten the frequency of the sound waves emanating from his harmonic glove. They are able to do far more damage under these circumstances. Any glass in the immediate area will shatter when this jutsu is used and the target of the jutsu may experience debilitating vertigo, strong nausea, or even hallucinations, although they would be uncontrolled by the user. It would be extremely rare for at least one of these symptoms not to appear. In addition, the target will suffer temporary deafness for at least 3 posts. Base Effect: Strong nausea is present after this technique is used. Stage Five Effect: Either debilitating vertigo or hallucinations (opponent controlled) are present after this technique used. But not both. Stage Six Effect: The opponent's eardrum may be ruptured. Requires Player and GM approval.														
841	4	3	Wind Spears	Kaze no Yari	This jutsu combines the principals of Kaze no Hari and Kaze no Sen. In effect, it creates multiple spears of wind that may be fired together or independently. Base Effect: Up to four spears may be created. Stage Five Effect: Up to six spears may be created. Stage Six Effect: Up to eight spears may be created. Their piercing properties are such that even three inches of reinforced steel may not entirely hinder the progress of its path. Defensive ninjutsu are undisturbed, though.														
841	4	4	Shriek	Himei no Jutsu	The user lets forth a loud scream, enhanced by chakra, usually loud enough to make people cover their ears and make their bodies numb due to high frequency sound waves. This jutsu should not be used overmuch, since it strains the user's throat quite a bit. Note: May only be used three times per thread.														
841	4	5	Dissonance: Crush	Fukyouwaon: Kujiku	With this technique the user creates a sound that is low pitched, and is controlled with chakra by the user. The sound waves target the abdomen of the opponent in an effort to bring about a sudden compression on the stomach of the foe. While the damage of this attack is only external, even the strongest of men will be brought to their knees by the sudden impact of this technique.														
841	4	6	Open Slot																
841	5	1	Ultimate Air Cutter	Zankuukyokuha	This jutsu is simply large-scale version of Zankuuha, as the name suggests, which also requires hand seals as well as the implants. The blast can wreak havoc upon anything it touches, although it is also risky to use, as it opens up the user to attack, since it requires both hands to focus all the air pressure. Capable of destroying small boulders and clearing strips of land, its speed is constant with the user's abilities, making it difficult for those of equal rank to dodge it. 16 Power: The power of this technique is such that it may destroy small boulders (the size of your average child). -23 Power: The power of this technique is such that it may destroy medium-sized boulders (the size of your average man). --30 power The power of this technique is such that it may destroy large boulders (the size of an adult grizzly bear) 17 Control: The range of this technique is 20 feet. -25 Control: The range of this technique is 30 feet. --33 Control: The range of this technique is 35 feet.														
841	5	2	UHF - Ultra High Frequency Waves	Kyokuchoutanpa	With an incredible amount of chakra precision, the user refines his harmonic glove sound waves even further. This type of sound has the ability to be potentially very destructive to structures, able to weaken, or even collapse, nearly any solid structure that has some type of cavity in which the sound waves may resonate. If a person is targeted, it can be equally devastating, but in a different way. The victim becomes unable to stand with vertigo and vomits the entire contents of his or her stomach. The eardrums shatter, deafening the victim for the rest of the thread, unless treated by a medical nin. Permanent deafness has been known to occur, as well. Hallucinations are still a possibility, but again, are uncontrolled by the user. 15 Control: The user may induce any one of the three temporary effects (vertigo, extreme nausea, hallucinations) mentioned upon a single opponent. -22 Control: The user may induce any one of the three temporary effects upon up to two opponents. --29 Control: The user may induce up to two of the three temporary effects upon all within a 10 foot radius (including allies). 17 Intelligence: Effects last for up to two posts. -25 Intelligence: Effects last for up to three posts. 16 Tactics: Shattering eardrums and temporary deafness (within the thread) requires player approval. -25 Tactics: Shattering eardrums and creating permanent damage requires admin approval.														
841	5	3	Wind Lance	Kaze no Ransu	In this new incarnation of the Kaze no Sen, the user creates a single, long air bolt of extreme density and power. It then is launched at high velocity toward a target. As it approaches the target, the user may choose to have the lance separate into several hundred needles much like those described in Kaze no Hari. 17 Power: As a lance, this jutsu may pierce Stage 4 defensive jutsu. In needle form, they may pierce standard armor plates. -24 Power: As a lance, this jutsu may pierce Stage 5 defensive jutsu. In needle form, they may still only pierce standard armor plates. 18 Control: A single lance may be created three times a thread. In needle form, up to 75 needles may created. -26 Control: In needle form, up to 100 needles may be created. --34 Control: In needle form, up to 150 needles may be created.														
841	5	4	Hell Shriek	Jigoku Himei no Jutsu	An improved version of the himei no jutsu. The voice of the shriek is twice as high, enough to make enemies go deaf and destroy glass. It sounds so horrible as if it comes from hell itself, making enemies cower with fear and terror. Note: May only be used twice a thread.														
841	5	5	Harmony: Push	Onchou: Oshi	This technique expels a large blast of sound to push back everyone within the maximum range of the blast. It flows forth from the mouth of the user, and hits all within 10 feet of the user. The force sung out is enough to break boulders into pebbles. However, this is all external damage, and a living being struck by this attack would simply feel as if he had been hit by a heavy blunt object over the entirety of his body.														
841	5	6	Voice: Vibration	Onsei: Yure	Onsei: Yure sends forth a force of sound from of the mouth of the user, and then directs it to the abdomen of the target. Upon impact, it causes all of the internal organs to vibrate, causing great pain, often brining the afflicted to their knees as agony overcomes their body. The sound travels in a straight line, and its path cannot be altered.														
841	6	1	200% Air Cutter	Nihyakuwari Zankuuha	Concentrating an incredible amount of chakra into the arm cannons, the user expels an extreme blast of wind with power equal to a category five hurricane (155+ mph). This incredible destructive force is more than capable of leveling nearly any obstacle. A person that is directly hit by this technique will be so seriously injured that he or she will be unable to participate further in the battle unless they are treated by a medical-nin of basic jounin level or higher. In order to build up enough power, the user must charge chakra into his arms for two posts prior to releasing the attack, during which, he or she may move, but cannot use chakra for any other purpose. Even bloodlines are incapable of being used within this charge period.														
841	6	2	Resonance Wave	Kyoushin no Onpa	In this jutsu, the user works to achieve resonance behind the eardrum, severely damaging the inner ear. This causes such imbalance in the victim that he or she will be unable to stand until treated by a medical nin of basic jounin level or higher (or until the thread ends). This jutsu does not cause any other side effects, save for the considerable amount of pain caused by the rupturing of the inner ear.														
841	6	3	Seismic Wave	Jishinha	This jutsu sends sound into the ground and causes a seismic wave that is similar to a earthquake in the surrounding area (about a 30 foot radius). Usually done to off-balance the opponent for an easy kill. Very deadly when combined with Kinsei Hakai, as it gives double the imbalance. However, the user must put at least one hand onto the ground. The jutsu will end, should the hand(s) be removed from the ground.														
841	6	4	Sound Absorption Technique	Kyuuon no Jutsu	Using the air cannon to draw environmental sound into the glove, the user can make his entire area lacking of any sound at all. Voices will not be heard. The sounds of explosions will vanish. There will be complete silence for a short amount of time, usually just enough to kill in silence... 16 Reserves: Produces an effective radius of non-sound for two posts. -23 Reserves: Produces an effective radius of non-sound for three posts. --30 Reserves: Produces an effective radius of non-sound for four posts. 15 Power: The radius of this technique is 15 feet. -23 Power: The radius of this technique is 25 feet. --31 Power: The radius of this technique is 35 feet.														
841	6	5	Harmony: Force	Onchou: Chikara	Onchou: Chikara sends a ball of sound energy roughly three feet in diameter at the foe. The effects of getting hit with this attack are two fold; the first, and the most obvious, effect is the external damage caused by the attack, which is quite devastating to say the least. The impact of this attack is tremendous, and is the equivalent of a powerful blunt force striking the entirety of the body of the target. The second effect is allows the technique to resonate throughout the body of the target, causing jolting in the body's muscles. As a result, the victim struck by this technique is incapacitated for one post.														
841	6	6	Vocal Immoderation	Seion Kado	Seion Kado works in a similar way to Onchou: Chikara, that it also sends a ball of sound energy towards the target. However, instead of causing physical damage at contact, the ball dissipates and the effects of the technique take effect. This diabolical technique targets the victim's ability to control the volume of his own voice, and in turn forces them to loudly shout all things they say. Also, as the victim speaks, his voice will continue to grow louder and louder, eventually placing great strain on the vocal cords of the afflicted. Due to this, the victim usually chooses to silence himself rather than continue speaking, as the pain from the stretching of the cords can be quite excruciating. This is likely a wise choice, as continual speech while under the power of this technique can cause the victim's vocal cords to snap. This technique lasts for 6 posts.														
841	7	1	Rain of Wind	Kaze no Hitoame	The user once again compresses air using sound waves, only in this case, several Kaze no Ransu are created. The usual form of this jutsu involves the creation of these Ransu above the target's head and bringing them down on top of him. This form of attack is incredibly destructive to whatever it hits, and also gave the jutsu its name. In spite of this, the user may create and aim the Ransu anywhere, however they must all travel in the same direction.														
841	7	2	Air Pressure Clone	Kuuatsu Bunshin	A powerful bunshin formed from Zankuuha Arm Cannons. Its strength though is directly proportional to the highest powered Zankuuha they are able to create. Having no Zankuuha techniques means the clone is at 10% the physical stats of the user. Zankuuha gives 25%, Zankuukyokuha gives 50%, Nihyakuwari Zankuuha gives 75%, and Boufuu Kyuutai gives 100%. They are like ordinary fighting clones, (no chakra) but when defeated they explode with the force of that Zankuuha. Only one clone may be created at a time.														
841	7	3	Rupture	Kekkai	The user pours chakra into their vocal cords and screams, using more chakra to manipulate the sound to only travel in a cone forward. The intense fluctuations in pressure caused by the hyper-amplified sound will cause microscopic weaknesses in the skin of any enemy caught in the blast to shear apart, creating thousands of tiny surface wounds. Internal tissues are affected as well at ranges less than 20 feet, creating numerous internal wounds that can take weeks to heal without a shinobi medic's intervention.														
841	7	4	Storm Sphere	Boufuu Kyuutai	An ultimate defense. Instead of shooting air pressure out from palms like the Zankuhaa technique, the user instead sends out air pressure from all over their bodies into all directions. Requires very good chakra control. Any nearby enemies and incoming projectiles gets blown away. Can also neutralize stage 6 offensive ninjutsu techniques within the vicinity. Since it requires so much chakra, it can only be used twice in battle.														
841	7	5	Open Slot																
841	7	6	Open Slot																
841	8	1	Splinter	Sakuhen	Focusing their chakra in much the same manner as Kekkai, the user takes great care to produce nothing but a single frequency of sound that resonates perfectly within the calcium formations that make up a human skeleton. At this precise frequency of vibration, the marrow within the skeleton begins to expand and contract, putting extreme pressure on the bones. If exposed to this sound for a fraction of a second, a target will simply have their skeleton weakened such that it can barely support their own weight. Further exposure (on the order of 1 second total) will cause the target's skeleton to splinter apart within their body. In most circumstances, this will cripple a target, but in extreme cases, bone fragments have been known to enter the heart or brain, killing a target outright.														
840	1	1	Smoke Clones	Kemuri Bunshin	With this technique, the user makes three handseals and breaths out plumes of rolling smoke which quickly take his exact form and appearance. It only takes a single hit to dispel them and they are incapable of inflicting any damage (even their replicated weapons burst into smoke on contact), but their Speed is superior to those of other basic bunshin techniques, retaining a third (including Taijutsu bonuses) of the user's Speed. Base Effect: 1 clone is made. Stage Two Effect: 3 clones are made. Stage Three Effect: 5 clones are made. Stage Four Effect: 7 clones are made.														
840	1	2	Air Filter	Earokaki	After forming a few handseals, the user exhales heavily. Instead of oxygen coming out, though, a steady stream of smoke spills out and forms a bubble around the user's head. While this effectively masks his identity, it also filters the oxygen around him to breathe clean air no matter the situation, even if he sits within a cloud of gaseous poison. The bubble of dark smoke does not hamper his senses in any way and lasts for three posts at a time.														
840	1	3	Signal Flag Technique	Shingouki no Jutsu	Forming one handseal and raising two fingers on the same hand, a thin ribbon of smoke will form and rise into the air. This technique does not offer any combat application, but is used to help guide team movements in the field. The signal is wispy at best, but is easily noticeable by others who have also taken this list; otherwise, the ribbon of smoke becomes easy for the eyes to skip over and miss.														
840	1	4	Veil of Darkness Technique	Yorunotobari no Jutsu	With this jutsu, a hazy personal cloud of smoke envelops the user and moves with him as he moves. The 'fog' has an approximate radius of five feet and serves to mask the fine details on his identity. While others may see a shadowy form flitting about, they will be unable to tell who it is, what he's wearing, the equipment he carries, and so on. Base Effect: The veil lasts for two posts. Stage Two Effect: The veil lasts for three posts. Stage Three Effect: The veil lasts for four posts. Stage Four Effect: The veil lasts for five posts.														
840	1	5	Smoke Pressurization	Kemuri Yoatsu	Through the studies of pressure and air manipulation, Sound Shinobi created an art to condense smoke great enough to give it solid substance. By creating an inordinate amount of smoke, Kemuri Yoatsu packs it all into a tight space and sets it at a certain level of pressure, giving the particles barely any space to move - akin to water molecules shifting states from liquid to solid. While this cannot be used for all techniques in this list, it does grant access to the more offensive jutsu available. Note: Techniques marked with an asterisk require this jutsu.														
840	1	6	Open Slot																
840	2	1	Art of Walking on Smoke	Kemuri Hokou no Gyou	A basic technique, this jutsu allows the user to literally stand and walk on otherwise insubstantial bodies of smoke. It requires no more Chakra than the basic Kinobori/Kabenobori jutsu but is much more limited in usage for it relies upon a single medium.														
840	2	2	Capture Wheels Technique	Taiho Hoiru no Jutsu	* Forming a single handseal, the user brings one hand to the mouth as if creating a Katon. Instead of blowing fire, though, several rings of smoke burst forth to attempt to bind a target's arms and legs to his body and robbing him of movement. If caught, it takes a Strength higher than Level Two to physically snap the bonds. The technique itself lasts only for one full post on unwilling targets, but against those who cannot resist (unconscious, willing, etc) it has no duration.														
840	2	3	Smoke Body Replacement Technique	Kemuri Kawarimi no Jutsu	More or less your standard Kawarimi technique, but instead of switching with an object the user bursts into a cloud of smoke with the force of two explosive pouches. Like any other Kawarimi technique, this can only be used twice per thread by itself or in combination with another Kawarimi.														
840	2	4	Fog Bound	Enmu Chouyaku	Designed as a technique to help in escaping, this technique causes twin jets of smoke to shoot out from the user's pant legs with surprising force. It propels him away in the opposite direction while leaving the equivalent of a smoke grenade in smoke behind. As a means to boost jumping, it isn't too powerful by itself; if someone were to stand still and use only this technique to move, it would only propel him roughly five feet upwards.														
840	2	5	Open Slot																
840	2	6	Open Slot																
840	3	1	Smoke Zone Technique	Kemuri Kuiki no Jutsu	* Kemuri Kuiki creates a personal bubble of smoke around the user, similar to Yorunotobari no Jutsu. While it operates the same way, studies in pressurization enhance the previous technique even further. Anything besides the user that enters the radius of the field is immediately slowed by the jammed particles of smoke, effectively lowering its Speed. This technique can be held for three posts before requiring a four post cooldown. Base Effect: The field has a five foot radius and lowers Speed by 1 Level. Stage Four Effect: The field has a radius of seven feet and lowers Speed by 1 Level. Stage Five Effect: The field has a radius of ten feet and lowers Speed by 2 levels.														
840	3	2	Perfect Eye Technique	Jasutogan no Jutsu	Smoke is an element best used as a screen, to hamper an enemy's field of vision and keep movements undetected. Understanding that principle, Sound nin developed this jutsu in preparation of their own tactics being used against them. Jasutogan, once activated, allows the user to see through anything that would otherwise block his vision unless it is a solid object. In other words, this eye technique lets the user see through a smokescreen but not through a rock wall. Jasutogan is not passive and requires a one post cooldown after its effects end. Base Effect: Lasts for two posts. Stage Four Effect: Lasts for three posts Stage Five Effect: Lasts for four posts.														
840	3	3	Tendril Technique	Makihige no Jutsu	* Taking a split second to make a single handseal, the user concentrates his Chakra around the index and middle fingers on one hand. A length of smoke then snakes out from the fingertips and can be employed for various means, though primarily it is used as a whip. The smoke is prehensile and can be fully controlled by the user to pick up loose items and bring it back, or perhaps to wrap around an overhanging tree branch and pull away from an attack. Makihige can be destroyed by a Ninjutsu technique higher than Stage Two or a Strength Level greater than Level Three. It has no inherent duration but often isn't used for too long since no other techniques can be used while this one is active. Base Effect: The tendril is fifteen feet long. Stage Four Effect: The tendril is twenty feet long. Stage Five Effect: The tendril is twenty-five feet long.														
840	3	4	Cloud Barrage Technique	Kumorenda no Jutsu	* A bastardization of an existing Katon technique, Kumorenda takes four handseals and a hand cupped to the mouth. Exhaling sharply, the user shoots out several volleyball-sized globs of smoke to inflict blunt physical damage against a target at the user's Strength Level. Upon impact, the globs each explode into the equivalent of half a smoke bomb. Base Effect: Can fire up to seven shots. Stage Four Effect: Can fire up to thirteen shots. Stage Five Effect: Can fire up to eighteen shots.

840	3	6	Open Slot																
840	4	1	Smoke Instantaneous Body Technique	Kemuri Shunshin no Jutsu	This is a simple variation of another standard technique; after completing the handseals, the user bursts into wisps of smoke and disappears from his current location, reappearing in another place he knows up to one mile away. This cannot be used in combat unless it is to escape.														
840	4	2	Dark Wall Technique	Kurai Kabe no Jutsu	* The first truly defensive technique in this list, Kurai Kabe forms a foot-thick wall of thick, black smoke anywhere within ten feet of himself. The wall is seven feet by seven feet is extremely effective against Taijutsu, for those without it cannot even hope to break its surface. The stationary wall lasts for two posts before dissipating. Base Effect: The wall can protect up to Stage Three Taijutsu and Stage One Ninjutsu. Stage Five Effect: The wall can protect up to Stage Four Taijutsu and Stage Two Ninjutsu. Stage Six Effect: The wall can protect up to Stage Five Taijutsu and Stage Three Ninjutsu.														
840	4	3	Dark Barrier Technique	Kurai Kekkai no Jutsu	* While exactly alike in appearance as Kurai Kabe (Dark Wall), Kurai Kekkai works in the polar opposite direction in terms of what it defends against. The barrier can be formed anywhere within ten feet of the user and is seven feet by seven feet and one foot thick; Ninjutsu attacks are often unable to pierce it, but strangely enough people can walk through it (though movements are a tad bit more sluggish in passing). Base Effect: The wall can protect up to Stage Three Ninjutsu and Stage One Taijutsu. Stage Five Effect: The wall can protect up to Stage Four Ninjutsu and Stage Two Taijutsu. Stage Six Effect: The wall can protect up to Stage Five Ninjtusu and Stage Three Taijutsu.														
840	4	4	Exhaust Pipe Technique	Ekipai no Jutsu	Having performed the handseals, the user will throw out both arms extended. From his sleeves a dark, ominous smoke bursts forth violently at great speed - almost like a passing wind. The blast of smoke is primarily used as a distraction to escape, but can also be used in offensive tactics as well. When used against lower ranked opponents, the targets are usually blown back several steps. Against equals, it merely holds them at bay, but does nothing to hamper adversaries higher in rank beyond creating a smokescreen for cover.

840	5	1	Stage Five	Stage Five	Ansatsu Enmu (Assassination Fog) This is, perhaps, one of the most staple Smoke techniques akin to Kirigakure no Jutsu for Mist Shinobi. From his mouth, sleeves, and pant legs will erupt plumes of smoke to cover a fifty foot diameter and reduce visibility to nil. Trying to operate through sound is useless as well, since the smoke dampers noises so even footsteps become nigh inaudible. This affects everyone who isn't trained to see through the cloud. This jutsu lasts for 3 posts with a 3 post cooldown														
840	5	2	Twin Smoke Serpent Technique	Futago Kemuri Hebi no Jutsu	* After making six handseals, the user extends an arm and from his sleeve a malicious pair of tendrils constructed from pure smoke will shoot out. The tendrils intertwine in a helix and can actually pierce through solid objects - wood, for instance, stands no chance - making this a very dangerous jutsu in the right hands. Normally it can only be done with one arm, but if the user sacrifices his defensive/evasive maneuvers for the post, he can use both arms to fire off two at a time. 15 Power: The technique's range is thirty feet. 22 Power: The technique's range is forty feet. 29 Power: The technique's range is fifty feet. 17 Tactics: The technique can punch through wood. 25 Tactics: The technique can punch through stone. 33 Tactics: The technique can punch through metal.														
840	5	3	Black Lung	Kuro Hai	I think I've got the black lung, pop,' Kuro Hai, while not exactly true to its actual medical counterpart, charges the user's fists with Chakra for three posts, requiring a two post cooldown afterwards. If anytime during those three posts the user's fists hit a person, the Chakra is converted into pure smoke that enters the victim's lungs, often reducing them into wheezes and coughs. This effectively lowers their Stamina by one full Level for two posts and stacks (if hit three times, Stamina would be lowered by three Levels) in power, but not in duration, so hitting three times would not mean Stamina is lowered by three Levels for six posts.

840	6	1	Creeping Mist Technique	Haihai Sagiri no Jutsu	With the handseals performed, the user plants both hands on the ground and immediately a thin, dark smoke seeps up and lingers around ankle-level. It clings to all those who are in contact with the smoke, winding up their bodies in a most subtle manner and weighing down their movements. Even allies are susceptible to this technique; the only person who is unaffected is the user. The smoke hangs around the area for three posts, reducing Speed by one full Level for every post a person remains in contact with it. 21 Power: The smoke covers a diameter of twenty feet. 28 Power: The smoke covers a diameter of thirty feet. 35 Power: The smoke covers a diameter of forty feet.														
840	6	2	Triple Smoke Defense	Sanjuu Kemuri Kyoshu	* Taking up one post where the user cannot attack to form handseals, three large wisps of smoke begin to circle freely around the user. They will then automatically move to counter an attack, and though they are not able to defend against high level techniques, their strength lies in the fact they do not require the user to direct them (they respond automatically to attacks) and their duration is indefinite until they are dispelled after blocking an attack. Since there are three bodies of smoke, that means three hits can be blocked. 20 Intelligence: Up to Stage Three Ninjutsu can be blocked. 27 Intelligence: Up to Stage Four Ninjutsu can be blocked. 19 Willpower: Up to Stage Three Taijutsu can be blocked. 27 Willpower: Up to Stage Four Taijutsu can be blocked.														
840	6	3	Fog Spears Technique	Sagiri Yari no Jutsu	* A most formidable technique, Sagiri Yari requires twelve handseals to be made before it can be activated. Pointing at a specific spot, the user viciously slashes with his fingers, drawing a line across whatever he desires to destroy. From that initial spot a small blob of smoke will form, and a thin spear of smoke will follow the path the user drew, drilling through whatever is in its path - which must be linear. Depth is inherently calculated through the technique; all that's needed is the user to set the route. Afterwards, the spears billow out into the equivalent of smoke grenades. 23 Control: One spear can be drawn. 30 Control: Two spears can be drawn. 34 Control: Four spears can be drawn. 22 Reserves: The spears can be drawn anywhere within a thirty foot diameter. 30 Reserves: The spears can be drawn anywhere within a fifty foot diameter. 38 Reserves: The spears can be drawn anywhere within a seventy foot diameter. 23 Power: The spears can drill through wood without any problem. 32 Power: The spears can drill through metal in one post. 41 Power: The spears can drill through metal without any problem.														
840	6	4	Smoke Sphere	Kemuri Kyuutai	* This technique creates a thick bubble of smoke around the user and his allies roughly twenty feet in diameter to protect and shield them from attacks and enemy sight. People within are able to see out, but they cannot launch any offensive tactics while under the protection of the smoke. Noise from the inside is trapped, meaning people outside cannot hear conversations on the inside, and vice versa with those inside trying to listen outside. The sphere can block up to Stage Five Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, poisons, and weapons and lasts as long as three posts.

840	7	1	Stage Seven	Stage Seven	Mokusatsu no Jutsu (Smother Technique) With this technique, the user exhales a malicious cloud of smoke to sit in an area for an extended period of time. Inhaling the smoke is like trying to breathe while caught in a fire - inhale too much smoke and you could die. Breathing apparatus and other such filters protect one from this jutsu's effects until it expires, which is usually takes about a day. The smoke is actually more hazy in appearance, so while vision is slightly impaired, people can still make out shapes and figures in the gloom. The range of this jutsu is 40 feet around the user.														
840	7	2	Shroud Technique	Ooi no Jutsu	Thought to be designed roughly a hundred years ago, Ooi no Jutsu creates a thin fog big enough to cover an entire army. All those that reside within the fog are effectively undetectable through any means. When looking at where the haze occupies, outsiders will see nothing but the weak haze itself. Sounds are kept inside the domain of the technique. Trying to use special means of vision (thermal, etc) will yield no results, nor will techniques that track Chakra signatures. Doujutsu that can see Chakra will not see through the technique, but rather will see a mass of pure Chakra.														
840	7	3	Havoc Technique	Sangai no Jutsu	Taking one post to form handseals where no attacks can be made, the user then extends both arms and shoots out a wicked cloud of black, roiling smoking from his sleeves. The smoke has an extremely high temperature, and those within it feel as if they are caught in the midst of a raging fire. The blasting smoke can burn through paper and leaves, set trees on fire, and inflict nasty second to third degree burns on a person. The smoke can extend up to seventy feet away and spreads fifty feet across.

839	1	1	Weaver: I	Oriko: Ichi	The most fundamental technique to be taught to a Rosutai clan member, Weaver is the conceptual basis upon which the clan's ninjutsu capabilities are built. Forming chakra within the hands, the user is capable of creating it within a physical medium as a passive ability; both in initial form and function working as simple chakra thread, akin to that created by numerous shinobi techniques including the very basis of puppeteer jutsu. However, this formed thread is can be more subtly affected by other jutsu within this list; creating intricate 'webs' of wiring much like spider's silk with the addition of the clan's specially crafted gloves, which act as an enzyme catalyst to create a more tangible form. At this stage, the maximum radius the web can extend from the user is five meters. One web strand may be created as a free action every post.														
839	1	2	Web Noise	Amimono Hibiko	Working along the basic principles which so many young children have turned into playtoys, this is the first jutsu that allows the user to make use of their web for information gathering purposes. Attaching a simple Oriko thread either to a location or a specific portion of their web, this string responds very well to the vibrations created from sound, allowing the vibration to travel through the string to the user's ears. This jutsu lasts until the strand is cut or the user releases it upon his own will. Stage 1: 1 strand may be created Stage 2: 2 strands may be created Stage 3: 3 strands may be created														
839	1	3	Anti-Venom: Immunity	Handokuei: Menekisei	The basis of Rosutai Venom techniques, this jutsu is required for further advancement in this list pertaining to Dokuei or Handokuei. With it, the user is able to passively course traces amounts of chakra through their system to negate the effects of any Dokuei jutsu. This allows both the use of any Venom/AntiVenom techniques within the clan list, as well as protection for the user from the venomous capabilities of other Rosutai.														
839	1	4	Tether	Kizumari	Another basic jutsu, but one highly efficient in keeping track of willing allies or unaware opponents, Kizumari allows the Rosutai to attach a weaver thread to another person which will continue to trail behind them until the thread is cut or the user releases the technique at his will. The distance that this technique can reach before unable to spool further is equal to the diameter of the user's Oriko Web.														
839	1	5	Cocoon Bunshin: Minor	Mayu Bunshin: Karui	Wrapping himself up in a large mass of weaver threads, the user surges an additional amount of chakra through the insulatory strands, which then peel away from the user as fully functional bunshin. These bunshin are fully functional, with 1/10th the user's physical stats, and can use one jutsu from this list that it meets the stat requirements for (upon which the clone is destroyed). Upon being assaulted the clone disintegrate. Stage 1: One Bunshin is created Stage 2: Two Bunshin are created Stage 3: Three Bunshin are created														
839	1	6	Open Slot																
839	2	1	Weaver: II	Oriko: Ni	An improvement upon the user's capability to mold their strands, this technique allows the user to imbue the first of multiple qualities into his 'web' creation. The most notable difference between this web and its basic version is the fact that the user now has the capability to decrease the visibility of his web with a highly translucent appearance. While the strands can be noticed, the amount of focus that must be used to note their subtle presence can greatly deter quick movement in the user's proximity. The amount of web strands that the user can effectively create has increased, along with the web's maximum radius, now ten meters. Two web strands may be created as a free action every post.														
839	2	2	Needle Sight	Shikaku no Hari	Yet another tactical use of the strands, the user is capable of wrapping a small projectile with a thread of woven web after performing this jutsu with additional effects. Upon throwing the projectile (generally a senbon needle, though kunai and other creations are capable of functionality as well), wherever the item may land the user can use a mild form of doujutsu to close off his own sight and see through the weapon's vantage point thanks to the wire wrapped around it. This is often referred to by the Rosutai as looking through 'the Eye of the Needle'														
839	2	3	Sensor Web	Amimono Kenshutsu	By either creating a new thread or making contact with a web that the user has already created the shinobi is aware of anything which passes by or through the location as it displaces the strands, allowing them to turn their webs into sentries. After being activated, this technique serves as a passive ability, and other jutsu can continue to be used. The maximum range that the user can still maintain awareness of any activity within his web is three hundred meters, allowing multiple tactical uses for this technique that varies between clan members. Stage 2: One web may be sensed at a time Stage 3: Two webs may be sensed at a time Stage 4: Three webs may be sensed at a time														
839	2	4	Venom: Irritant	Dokuei: Jirasu	The first offensively focused Venom technique, (and partially a misnomer) Irritant serves a simple function: giving opponents a reason to avoid the Rosutai webs. By channeling chakra through the strands of their web, the surge is capable of activating an enzyme within the compound that causes an annoying rash in many ways similar to the effects of poison ivy upon contact with the skin of those without Anti-Venom immunization. Should these locations actually be scratched or rubbed, the affected area of skin simply spreads further; this effect lasts for a total of three posts after contact.														
839	2	5	Web Shield	Amimono Tate	Upon performing the handseals for this jutsu, the user quickly threads two long strands of web through each other numerous times, creating a large, sturdy square shield approximately two feet tall and two feet across. The shield can be worn on the arm thanks to the adhesive properties capable of being channeled through the web, and protects against taijutsu and ninjutsu attacks of Stage 1 or lower. The barrier can absorb three blows before dissipating, or can be released into a large mass of web at the user's will.														
839	2	6	Open Slot																
839	3	1	Weaver: III	Oriko: San	Increasing their capabilities, the Rosutai's thread creation abilities have expanded both the properties and the range of their web. Building upon the previous ranks of weaving the user is now capable of adding a 'sticky' property when creating strands or upon contact with currently existing ones with an adhesive strength equivalent to industrial strength duct tape, while the maximum radius of web creation has been further increased to fifteen meters. The amount of strands which can be easily integrated into the user's web has increased, as has the intricacy of the designs which may be created in setting these traps. Three web strands may be created as a free action every post.														
839	3	2	Anti-Venom: Preserve	Handokuei: Tamotsu	A special technique among the Rosutai arsenal, this jutsu makes astounding use of the capability to break down their weaving. Upon completing the hand seals required, the user makes contact with the target location, whether it be an item, another person, or themselves. A mass of web strands shoot from their hands, until the object is completely encased. With another pulse of chakra throughout the web, the threads begin to break down into a preservative enzyme film which negates the effects of any acids or contact poisons on the surface for a duration of three posts. Stage 3: Protect against Stage 2 poison Stage 4: Protect against Stage 3 poison Stage 5: Protect against Stage 4 poison Note: If used outside of combat on a non-organic target, this ability preserves the item in pristine condition, protecting it from all outside effects not created by ninjutsu. Things such as paper, clothing materials, harvested fruit, vegetable and even meat products are protected, keeping them in a form of suspended animation from Time.														
839	3	3	Chakra Weave	Chakra Ori	One of the most guarded techniques within the Rosutai arsenal, this jutsu is an excellent tactical tool for setting 'traps' within the shinobi's web. After performing this technique, the Rosutai is capable of molding the chakra of the next ninjutsu technique he uses into a thin strand of chakra wire. The wire can then be integrated into the user's web, or left stray in whatever manner the user wishes. At the user's will, the strand's chakra can then be released with an extra handseal, activating the jutsu from which the strand was woven. This technique does not bypass any special requirements of the imbued jutsu, and as such any jutsu which required physical touch would require that the opponent be in contact with the chakra strand, etc. Stage 3: Up to Stage 2 ninjutsu may be woven Stage 4: Up to Stage 3 ninjutsu may be woven Stage 5: Up to Stage 4 ninjutsu may be woven Stage 6: Up to Stage 5 ninjutsu may be woven														
839	3	4	Web Spears	Amimono Yari	Channeling chakra into their already-created web, the user is capable of causing a massive surge at a desired point in his web (whether the Weaver web or another jutsu-created web), from which another thread will jab outward at the desired target; this thread then expands and hardens, until effectively becoming a six foot long pointed spear of synthesized gossamer. The possible deadly effects of this technique are apparent enough, though it is only usable against those already within the web's radius. Stage 3: One spear is created Stage 4: Two spears are created Stage 5: Three spears are created														
839	3	5	Venom: Numb	Dokuei: Mahi	An improvement within the Rosutai's poisonous capabilities, the shinobi can now create a venom that must be inserted into the bloodstream by coating an object in the Rosutai's woven strands, then surging chakra through the strands until they break down into the desired toxin. Generally, this process is performed upon senbon or kunai for throwing purposes, though can be applied to any surface. Upon reaching the blood stream, the venom requires two posts to take effect as it spreads from the injection. After this, the area within one foot of the injection point goes numb for a duration of three posts.														
839	3	6	Open Slot																
839	4	1	Weaver: IV	Oriko: Yon	Once again, the user's skill increases with another level of weaving. At this stage, the capability of the Rosutai further expands the complexity allowed in the creation of his webs as well as the radius of the web, reaching to up to twenty meters. The tensile strength of the web also increases with this stage, becoming as resilient as wire strands, still able to be cut or broken by capable shinobi but nevertheless growing more bothersome to those who move through them. Four web strands may be created as a free action every post.														
839	4	2	Venom: Wither	Dokuei: Shibomu	After performing the required handseals for this jutsu the user creates several strands of oriko thread and continues to channel chakra into the webbing for several moments. As the chemicals within the gossamer break down, the user can apply the strands any surface (or any open wound) upon which they will decompose into a viscous liquid coating. Once this venom is injected into the blood stream the limb which is injected begins to decay at an astounding rate, affected by an acute form of necrosis. The effects of this ailment are seen immediately, as the skin begins to blacken and die on the target limb; within the second post the opponent loses feeling of the limb instead of having massive pains, but by the fourth post after injection the limb's flesh and muscle tissue have decayed to the point that the appendage is no longer usable. This effect can be cured by a Chuunin level or higher medic, and must be treated within two threads from injection or the target risks permanently losing the limb. If injection occurs via the head or chest, the target chooses the limb to be affected.														
839	4	3	Cocoon Bunshin	Mayu Bunshin	An obvious improvement upon its predecessor, this technique allows the Rosutai to create a notably more formidable clone. With this incarnation, the cocoon bunshin has 1/3rd the physical stats of its creator including taijutsu bonuses, and can use one jutsu from this list up to stage 3 (though upon doing so the bunshin is immediately destroyed). Unlike the Minor technique, this version explodes into a flurry of strands whenever it is hit, and these webs remain present for three posts before disintegrating. Stage 4: One Bunshin is created Stage 5: Two Bunshins are created Stage 6: Three Bunshins are created														
839	4	4	Venom: Corrosion	Dokuei: Kusareru	A venom whose ability is the exact opposite to that of Preservation. The user covers whatever he wishes to affect with webbing and charges strands with chakra. Instead of keeping something free from the effects of deterioration, this toxin serves to speed up the aging process of its target. Metal turn into rust, stonework erodes into dust, organic matters such as trees and flora decays or crumbles into brittle pieces. While it has no effect on living tissues, when used on a corpse the technique is able to decay everything down to bare bones in the matter of seconds. Most often used to plant traps, alter the surrounding to the user's advantage or strip opponents of their inventory.														
839	4	5	Web Armor	Koutetsu no Amimono	In a similar manner to creating a cocoon bunshin, the user shrouds himself in a mass of woven strands. However, with this technique the user leaves the threads covering his body. Channeling chakra into the 'cocoon', the user is able to create a sturdy, flexible coating of armor. While this armor is active, all taijutsu strikes are softened by three stages of strength, and lasts for a duration of four posts.														
839	4	6	Open Slot																
839	5	1	Weaver: V	Oriko: Go	With this improvement upon the Rosutai's weaving capabilities, the user is able to create increasingly dangerous web strands in place of simple nuisances. Synthesized web now has an inherent sharpness equivalent to razor wire, proving a danger to anyone foolish enough not to tread lightly through the Rosutai's web. The radius of the web makes a further increase at this stage, reaching up to twenty five meters. The level of intricacy involved in generating and plotting web traps at this stage has also greatly increased, to the point that some traps may seem almost like works of art. Five web strands may be created as a free action every post.														
839	5	2	Venom: Hibernation	Dokuei: Toumin	A misleading name for a toxin that serves to temporarily slow the body's activity speed. The toxin enters the target's body, whether by bloodstream or indigestion. By the following post their body experiences a drop in metabolism akin to an conscious state of torpor. While the target remains awake, their mental reaction speed takes a dive, thus affecting their physical reaction. It appears to them that their own sense of "Time" has slowed in comparison to the rest of the world's; while everything seems to be moving at normal speed, only he is stuck in slow-motion. The target remains in this state for two posts before the toxin loses its effect.														
839	5	3	Bug	Oucho	The pinnacle of Rosutai surveillance jutsu, Bug allows the user to generate a complex piece of animate chakra wire that folds and ties itself to resemble an extremely small spider. This can be placed on a target by hand or can be placed on the user's web, upon which the bug can move around to obtain access to its target. This minute creation transmits a signal back to its creator up to a distance of two miles with pinpoint accuracy, and can also record up to five posts of audio information, via emulating the vibrations caused sounds it heard. To playback this feature, the bug must be placed into the user's ear, where it activates the recording. The bug lasts until it is destroyed or the user wills it to end; only one bug can be active at a time.														
839	5	4	Web Wall	Amimono Kabe	A rather straightforward jutsu, but nevertheless extremely useful; upon performing the handseal required, the user places his palms on the ground as threads begin flowing quickly outwards. From this location, a wall of intertwined webs rises up to a maximum of eight feet high and five feet across, protecting the user and all others behind the barrier from ninjutsu and genjutsu techniques up to a maximum of stage four for up to a duration of four posts, with only one barrier capable of being in existence at a time. After creation, the user does not need to maintain hand placement to keep the barrier raised.														
839	5	5	Venom: Toxin Blast	Dokuei: Dokuso Bakuha	Similar in range to web spears, this venom technique can be considered one of the more indiscriminate within the Rosutai arsenal, which is generally known for its precision and tactical planning; yet sometimes indiscriminate attacks play just as much a tactical purpose as carefully placed traps. Focusing chakra into their web(whether the Weaver web or a jutsu-created web), the user is capable of catalyzing the enzymes of the strand at any desired location. Almost immediately, the web explodes at this point, showering everything (friend or foe alike) within ten meters with a liquid neurotoxin capable of infiltrating the body via the skin. Once this venom has made contact with a being's skin, it takes effect immediately. Though not causing any physical damage, the toxin causes massive stomach pains during the first post, followed by violent muscle contractions throughout the body on the second post. During the third post the user falls into a normal state with no effects, before the venom clears the body on the fourth post with a second wave of muscle contractions. Dokuso Bakuha may only affect individuals twice before their bodies develop a temporary immunity lasting the duration of the thread.														
839	5	6	Anti-Venom: Catalyst	Handokuei: Kousu	One of the more peculiar Anti-Venom techniques, catalyst allows the user to create a simple strand of synthesized web before charging it with chakra to activate a set of enzymes within the material. This strand can then be ingested, where it reacts within the digestive tract to cause a sudden surge of power, increasing all physical stats of the individual by one stage for three posts, after which there is a fallout leading to a drop in physical abilities by two stages for two posts; all physical stage changes within this jutsu are to the lowest value of the stage. It can also be used on opponents either via forced ingestion or through blood. If anyone with less than stage two in any physical statistic ingests the catalyst, they will be in a comatose state for the rest of the thread, and will need chuunin-level or higher medical attention to be revived.														
839	6	1	Weaver: VI	Oriko: Roku	Yet another increase in the Rosutai's weaving, at this stage the user's web becomes even more deadly. Each strand created now has minute barbs covering its length, increasing both the ability of the web to draw blood from opponents, as well as the pain upon pulling any webs from the skin. The web's radius is increased to thirty meters at this stage, and the user is capable of creating up to six strands as a free action every post.														
839	6	2	Cocoon Bunshin: Major	Mayu Bunshin: Shutaru	The pinnacle of Rosutai cocoon bunshins, this technique allows the user to create a bunshin with the full physical stats of the user with no taijutsu bonuses, and can use up to two techniques that the user knows from this list before dissipating. As usual, to create bunshins the user performs the necessary handseal before being encased in a swarm of threads, after which the cocoon pulls itself off of the user as an animate clone. The most notable capability of this bunshin is that if it is damaged and still has both remaining jutsu uses, it can reform itself, effectively weaving itself back together. If the bunshin is struck with one jutsu usage remaining, or if it uses both jutsu available, it is destroyed.														
839	6	3	Web Bind	Amimono Shibaru	Performing the required handseals for this jutsu, the user must make physical contact with an opponent, upon which a mass of web strands quickly wrap around the target, encasing them in a sturdy cocoon. Much like a spider waiting for the time to eat its prey, this jutsu is practically impossible to escape from once captured, as neither ninjutsu nor taijutsu can pierce the barrier either coming in or out of the cocoon. As such, this technique is most useful for taking someone out of a fight, whether it be enemy or ally, buying time or evening the odds depending on the situation; at the risk of closing the gap to melee range. This technique lasts for a duration of four posts with a two post cooldown, is limited to three uses per thread, and requires opponent permission.														
839	6	4	Venom: Paralytic	Dokuei: Chuufu	A potent venom, this technique has amazing disabling capabilities. Upon performing the handseals required for this jutsu, the user creates a small strand of web before infusing it with a large amount of chakra, causing the thread to break down into a more volatile form. At the user's will, this substance breaks down even further into a semisolid coating wherever the strand has been placed, allowing melee weapons, projectiles, and even the Rosutai's web to be coated with this jutsu. Paralytic must be directly injected into the user's veins to take effect; after one post, the target's body simply becomes paralyzed, unable to move for three posts. Upon being subjected to this venom, the taget gains a resistance to it, whereas the next time it is injected the effect only lasts for one post, and upon the third time the target is immune to the venom for the remainder of the thread.														
839	6	5	Web Dome	Amimono Engai	Upon performing this jutsu, the user reveals its namesake. A massive mound of strands thread together, forming an extremely durable dome of web with a radius of five meters, which resists assault from ninjutsu and taijutsu assaults up to stage 5, while lasting a duration of four posts. To create this barrier, the user must either be standing within his already-created web from which the strands rise up and form the dome, or place his hands on the ground to weave the threads together himself. After creation, the user is not required to have his hands placed to the ground in order to keep the barrier up, and is capable of using other jutsu. This technique has a cooldown period of five posts after initial use, and can be lowered prematurely at the user's will.														
839	6	6	Open Slot																
839	7	1	Weaver: VII	Oriko: Shichi	True mastery of the Rosutai capabilities has been achieved. At this pinnacle of the user's weaving there are no further latent abilities to be learned, though the intricacy and size of the web has grown exponentially. The Rosutai is now capable of creating a web up to thirty five meters in radius, and can create up to eight strands per post as a free action.														
839	7	2	Venom: Greater Wither	Dokuei: Shutaru Shibomu	Performing the necessary handseals, the user creates multiple strands of thread, then continues to charge them with chakra. As the oriko webbing reacts, the proteins within the strands break down, allowing the strands to degenerate into a viscous form of liquid upon coming into contact with another material. This potent venom is then placed into an open wound or coated onto a weapon to allow direct injection; once the opponent is injected, this jutsu takes effect. At the end of one post, the skin around the injection area will have blackened with the shriveling decay of necrosis; by the end of the second post, this affect has covered the entirety of the target's body. With the third post, the effect carries over to the target's muscle tissue, eating away at the muscle around the injection point. By the fourth, this expansion has occurred again as all of the opponent's tendons and ligaments have been eaten away. At the end of the fifth post necrosis takes hold of the major organs, and the death of the target. Requires opponent permission or death enabled thread.														
839	7	3	Mass Web Constriction	Shitsuryou Shimeru no Amimono	A powerful technique capable of stopping entire groups in their tracks, the Rosutai chooses a location within sight, up to three hundred meters away. Placing their hand upon the ground, the user forces a single thread along the ground until it reaches the desired point; from here the strand branches off into an intricate web with a radius up to fifty meters. All individuals within this distance are snared for a duration of five posts as the web expands up their legs and binds them into place. Only taijutsu or ninjutsu of stage six or greater can break the hold made by this technique.

838	1	1	Koukogaku - Archeology	Koukogaku - Archeology	Any who plan to actually use later jutsu of Zouge no Kioku must possess this technique. Koukogaku itself represents the base knowledge necessary to turn dead sources of bone into weapons. It allows the user to rapidly extend their chakra through the earth and trail through all traces of calcium that they come across. Otherwise, retrieving sources of bone from the earth would prove to be much too slow of a process. Additionally, Koukogaku allows the user to identify the individual bones of humans and the type of animal that a skeleton belongs to. Koukogaku works passively, but must be taken to use other jutsu from Zouge no Kioku.														
838	1	2	Unsan-ha - Scatter Tooth	Unsan-ha - Scatter Tooth	This technique targets and conjures the teeth of predators, most iconically those of sharks and big cats. The user's chakra refines the edge and hardens the calcium, making the teeth akin in strength and sharpness to makibishi. The teeth themselves are brought to the user's palm, at which point they're capable of throwing or dropping them as they would any other type of caltrop. Like makibishi, the teeth can puncture thin soles but serve much more as a distraction than any source of true damage.														
838	1	3	Abara Kaibou - Rib Rise	Abara Kaibou - Rib Rise	Underground, the bones the user controls are broken apart and reshaped into a single, long, curved spike resembling both a rib and a tusk. At a point about a foot in front of the user, the spike pushes its way through the soil and rock, the point angled back towards the user. While the movement seems sudden, it is fairly slow and the tip of the bone is brittle and poorly suited to offense. In actuality, this jutsu is meant to be used defensively, capable of taking a solid taijutsu hit or frightening the opponent with its ominous appearance. The rib is five feet tall and tapers out to a foot diameter base. Ninjutsu can strike through the bone easily.														
838	1	4	Hofuku Zouge - Crawling Ivory	Hofuku Zouge - Crawling Ivory	A somewhat morbid technique, the user first forces their chakra into the ground. Cobbling together pieces of bone below the surface, they then summon the completed form of the technique to claw its way to the surface. Crawling Ivory creates a more or less complete, animated skeleton of a lizard, roughly the size of a Gila Monster (two feet long). The lizard is comparable to a bunshin and its bones fall apart when given a solid hit. It is armed with tiny claws and teeth, but is limited in strength by its size. The lizard perpetually has strength and stamina of level one, but its speed is 1/6th of the user's without bonuses. It may not use jutsu of any kind. Stage One: One lizard Stage Two: Two lizards Stage Three: Three lizards

838	2	1	Yadama-ha - Missile Tooth	Yadama-ha - Missile Tooth	An evolution of Scatter Tooth, this jutsu likewise manipulates the jagged incisors of dead predators. However, while the teeth are again collected in the user's hand, he need not simply cast them back to the ground. Instead, he can throw them as viable projectiles, aided by ninjutsu propulsion. The teeth are as sharp as kunai but lack the standard weapon's weight or size. Thus, they tend to simply embed themselves in flesh. Each tooth is serrated slightly and up to eight of the miniature weapons can be thrown and launched at once.														
838	2	2	Tekubi Tokage - Wrist Lizard	Tekubi Tokage - Wrist Lizard	Crafting a roughly reptilian skeleton, the user has the whole construct slip out of their sleeve and down their arm. While the body doesn't necessarily resemble a lizard (snakes, salamanders, and even large rats could apply), the purpose of the technique remains the same. The legs and body of the skeleton wrap around one of the user's fore arms and the skull, complete with teeth, encase one fist. The mouth is splayed open, allowing any punch made by the user to also strike with the teeth of the beast. The skeleton's body serves as a simple bracer for a duration of three posts, at which point the bones disconnect from one another and tumble to the ground.														
838	2	3	Zugai Wana - Skull Trap	Zugai Wana - Skull Trap	The user crafts and conjures a half dozen skulls, all belonging to small reptiles or mammals. The skulls rise to the surface and lay open loosely. They are scattered in an area approximately five feet in diameter. Upon any living intrusion into the zone, most likely the feet of an enemy, the skulls rear up and fling themselves towards the opponent's ankles. Being called a 'trap' is somewhat of a misnomer, as while the skulls attach themselves and viciously puncture skin, their weight is negligible and they can't hold the target down. They exist dormant for four posts, but may only be in an active, biting state for two.														
838	2	4	Hishou Zouge - Flying Ivory	Hishou Zouge - Flying Ivory	Similar in nature to Crawling Ivory, this jutsu haphazardly creates the skeletons small, flying animals. Typically, this refers to birds between the size of a crow and the size of a hawk, but it can also put together bats of similar proportions. The beasts have identical stats to the lizards because of their similar limitations (Level One Strength and Stamina, 1/6th user's Speed without bonuses) with their only advantage lying in their flight. The creations fly through their chakra nature given that they no longer have the skin or feathers necessary for normal birds. A solid hit breaks the bones apart. Stage Two: Two birds Stage Three: Three birds Stage Four: Four birds

838	3	1	Kutai Hebi - Body Snake	Kutai Hebi - Body Snake	With a set of seals identical to Wrist Lizard, the user then adds a single 'snake' seal at the end of the string. From out of the earth shoots the skeletal form of a serpent, typically a constrictor of quite some length. It is usually some six to eight feet long, its size depending on the creator. Upon streaming out of the ground, the snake quickly wraps itself around any limb of the user or the torso/abdominal area. The snake's bones rapidly harden, protecting the user from level three Strength and stage two and under ninjutsu. The snake lasts two posts before falling apart or until struck by an attack stronger than it can block. Note that the snake only blocks the area it covers.														
838	3	2	Shirou Kashitsu - White Accident	Shirou Kashitsu - White Accident	A sneaky jutsu, this technique uses the long bones primarily found in ribs or the legs. There is no immediate visible effect; the controlled calcium simple sits beneath the surface of the ground and waits in a designated area. Within the post it is summoned or the post thereafter, the user may activate the jutsu, causing the bone to slide through the soil like a white tree root or tripwire. This is useful for catching running opponents off guard as the bone usually sits just far enough above the surface to slide over a foot until it hits ankle. The bone is an easy way to trip a foe, but is unable to bind anyone down.														
838	3	3	Adauchi-ha - Vengeance Tooth	Adauchi-ha - Vengeance Tooth	Useful as a follow up technique from any of the previous tooth jutsu, the user first recaptures the fangs with their chakra. However, rather than return them to his hand, he leaves them wherever they have happened to fall. Six teeth can be reused in this way, causing them to fire themselves towards the opponent with the force of thrown kunai. As they fly, the fangs expand, becoming equal in size and force to daggers and thus causing more damage. The teeth can't 'track' and essentially fly in a straight line from where they started. Like Missile Tooth, the Vengeance version is serrated.														
838	3	4	Tooboe Zouge - Howling Ivory	Tooboe Zouge - Howling Ivory	The third full creation technique, Tooboe Zouge pulls together the bodies of dogs and similarly sized and built predators between 4 feet long and 3 feet tall. The dogs are horrible creations, being recognizable and yet utterly alien and unfriendly. Each dog has 1/3rd Speed of the user, but only 1/5th Strength and Stamina without bonuses. They are unable to use jutsu, but retain some level of their predatory instincts, capable of tracking opponents through mundane concealment (foliage, crowds, but no hiding jutsu and especially not shunshin) to a range of two hundred feet. They break apart upon being struck. Two created per use.

838	4	1	Souhaku Kansei - Pale Trap	Souhaku Kansei - Pale Trap	The Pale Trap is a dangerous jutsu that requires the user to willingly take an attack to successfully perform. Anticipating or watching an attack head towards them, the user makes their seals and digs their chakra into the ground. Upon receiving the blow and using it as the most advantageous time frame, the jutsu activates. The user's clothes are usually torn up as a dozen skeletal snakes rip out and latch themselves into the opponent, stabbing their fangs into the offending limb. Alternatively, this jutsu can be directed out of a specific opening in the user's dress, turning into a bony version of Hidden Snake Hands. These snakes can be immediately torn out with Strength of fourth level and above; other targets must spend a whole post prying the snakes out of their flesh. Should the target be able to make seals, any offensive jutsu causes the snakes to crumble to dust.														
838	4	2	Shirou Gonan - White Misfortune	Shirou Gonan - White Misfortune	An evolution of the White Accident. The first effect of the jutsu is entirely the same; in fact the process is a perfect replica, down to the seal string. However, at the end of the original chain, an extra seal of snake is tacked on. A half dozen additional rib bones lay in wait in front of the one meant to trip the opponent, but are all perpendicular to it. When contact is made with the tripping bone, the remaining ribs immediately prop themselves up and push out of the ground, forming a small spike trap for the opponent to impale themselves upon. Each rib is about six inches long and reasonably sharp.														
838	4	3	Kyousha-ha - Spear Tooth	Kyousha-ha - Spear Tooth	As implied, this furthers the tooth line of jutsu to being akin to spearheads. Uniquely, instead of a volley of teeth, this instead draws up, usually, one long, wicked fang. The tooth itself is about a foot long end to end and unnaturally straight. It travels at kunai speed and is useful as the first potentially lethal technique of Zouge no Kioku. The Spear Tooth may be reused as part of Vengeance Tooth, but it does not change size. While Spear Tooth usually creates one fang, that number can change depending on skill level: Stage Four: One fang Stage Five: Two fangs total, at the same or different targets Stage Six: Three fangs total, at the same or different targets														
838	4	4	Bunpou Zouge - Swarming Ivory	Bunpou Zouge - Swarming Ivory	The name of this technique is somewhat of a misnomer. Rather than conjure up a traditional swarm such as a shroud of insects, this instead creates smaller creatures than the stage before, but increases the number. However, to deal with the amount of bone needed, the actual constructs have occasionally noticeable awkward parts; mismatched vertebrae and ribs and so on. In some respects, they all look like semi-upright lizards, being about the size of terriers and having hooked claws on all four limbs. To those schooled in archaeology, like a Honekaigi member, the beasts resemble diminutive raptors. Each one has 1/3rd the Speed of the user, only 1/6th of the Strength and Stamina all without bonuses, but are created in sets of four. Like previous Ivory incarnations, they cannot use jutsu.

838	5	1	Guttari Yubi - Senseless Fingers	Guttari Yubi - Senseless Fingers	The Honekaigi usually find themselves busy with their hands, typically scribbling away in tomes and files and so on. As master organizers, they understood the help an extra pair of hands could be, and thus the Senseless Fingers. A gruesome combination of bones, the end result of the Fingers typically contains (and bears resemblance to) the bodies of fish, snakes, lizards, and other small, long animals. A pair of five-fingered hands, more or less, are created on jointed arms and forearms that clutch to the user's clothing, or skin if necessary, with claws or teeth. The ends of the digits usually end in tiny skulls, with each finger being a spine. The hands only have half the physical stats of the user and cannot be used as a proxy for handseals. They are, however, useful for holding items the user is not actively using, blocking incoming attacks, and generally confusing and disturbing enemies.														
838	5	2	Shirou Kyouhen - White Disaster	Shirou Kyouhen - White Disaster	Maliciously, this technique forgoes the set up of its predecessors. Rather than go through the process of setting a trip wire and waiting for the foe to fall into the trap, the White Disaster springs immediately upon being used. In a small ring around the target, eight inch rib bones suddenly stab up and in, forming a barbed circle. As they aren't very tall, the disaster is most useful for crippling an opponent's mobility, as the ribs are sharp enough and rise with enough speed to separate muscle from bone and pierce through padded cloth armor. The spikes can be easily removed by hand after the initial attack.														
838	5	3	Kutai Jourui - Body Fortress	Kutai Jourui - Body Fortress	Gathering together a mass of skeletal animals, this jutsu creates a literal wall of bodies. The lizards, snakes, birds, rats and so on scrabble over each other as the eight foot high and twelve foot long wall takes form. Attacks that hit the wall cause the skeletons to fragment and fly off, but collectively the bodies take a beating. Ninjutsu below stage five and Strength below level five are essentially useless against the wall. Anything above causes it to shatter spectacularly, raining down harmless but annoying bits of fossil. The wall lasts for two posts on its own.														
838	5	4	Honba Zouge - Galloping Ivory	Honba Zouge - Galloping Ivory	While the Honekaigi disliked leaving their libraries, some had to travel in order to procure information. To minimize travel time, the Galloping Ivory was created. This animates the skeleton of a work animal, typically that of a standard horse. Depending on the region, other animals can be used for similar purposes, such as ostriches or large cats. Like other Ivory techniques, the primary focus is speed; this brings it to a new limit, however. Out of combat, the Galloping Ivory moves at speeds equal to that of a normal horse, occasionally slightly faster. In combat, it has the full Speed of the user including 1/3rd bonuses, but Strength and Stamina lag behind with Â½ without bonuses. The Galloping Ivory is fast, but rickety compared to a real mount. It cannot use jutsu.

838	6	1	Kutai Kikou - Body Armor	Kutai Kikou - Body Armor	Essentially, Body Armor wraps the Body Fortress around the user. Like before, this summons up a horde of various partway together creatures. This time, though, they collect themselves around the user, going so far as to stylize it to the Honekaigi's individual taste. Rib-spike pauldrons and fanged helmets are not uncommon, each with personal touch. The creatures act like an extremely fluid set of field plate, rendering the user difficult to injure and only slightly hindered in movement. The Armor survives stage five ninjutsu and level five Strength and lasts for two posts.														
838	6	2	Ou-Kutai Wana - King Skull Trap	Ou-Kutai Wana - King Skull Trap	The heavily upgraded version of the original Skull Trap. Rather than simply cling to an opponent's ankles, this technique seeks to devour the target. With a great, sudden motion, a tyrannosaurus skull, or other colossal predator, bursts out of the ground around the target, jaws open. Immediately thereafter, once it has reached up its full six feet, the jaws snap closed, effectively trapping anything unlucky enough to be caught inside. Each tooth is roughly the size and strength of a newly sharpened tanto and there are plenty of teeth. The jaws can be pried open with level six Strength and destroyed from within or without by stage five or above ninjutsu. It only actively squeezes the target for one post, after which it returns to being a normal skull.														
838	6	3	Kouten-ha - Heaven Tooth	Kouten-ha - Heaven Tooth	This is a difficult jutsu to perform for it involves not just finding available bones but also summoning them away from the earth. Gathering up fangs and claws, the user typically casts a finger upwards to the sky, which occurs at the exact moment those teeth appear in miniature puffs of smoke in the air some thirty or so feet above. The teeth then fall, but not just by force of gravity. Rather, they launched like arrows, plummeting straight down and tearing through treetrunks like paper. The teeth coat a ten foot radius area in pearly death and pierce through most material short of steel. The rain occurs over two posts.														
838	6	4	Sensui Zouge - Diving Ivory	Sensui Zouge - Diving Ivory	The Diving Ivory signifies a large step forward in combat capability for the Ivory line. The user pieces together ancient fish and sharks, normally between the size of a barracuda to small sharks. These fish jump in and out of the earth and swim through the soil as though it were water. Upon nearing opponents, they jump out, snap, and flail. Each fish has the full stats of the user with Speed also getting 1/3 bonuses. They cannot use jutsu.

838	7	1	Shirou Mokushi - White Apocalypse	Shirou Mokushi - White Apocalypse	The Honekaigi finishes their seals and sends a great pulse of chakra through the ground. There is, at first, a small rumble before the technique activates. Soon, though, a mess of animal parts bursts out of the ground in a quickly spreading circle. An area in a fifty foot radius, centered on the user, is suddenly assaulted by all manner of dead beast, complete with gnashing fangs and claws. Where no full skeletons could be made, sharpened ribs, femurs, and so on jut up. The entire uprising resembles an explosion of the dead, taking place in just as much time and causing just as much destruction. At the end of the post, the skeletons tumble to the ground.														
838	7	2	Kutai Nejiro - Body Citadel	Kutai Nejiro - Body Citadel	An expansion of the Body Fortress, the Citadel renders a larger area nearly impervious. A dome up to thirty feet in diameter is covered by the miscellaneous fossils, evolving from the small lizards of before to even elephants if need be. The dome is thick and strong, resisting the effects of stage six jutsu and below infinitely. The Citadel lasts through a stage seven hit, but crumbles afterwards and a stage eight rips through it entirely. Similarly, Strength below nine are nothing and hits of level ten and above cause it to fall apart. The dome can be held for two posts.														
838	7	3	Souhaku Rou - Pale Tower	Souhaku Rou - Pale Tower	An environmentally taxing technique, the Pale Tower draws up nearly every available source of bone in the area and multiplies them. At first, the mound of bones builds beneath the user, but it quickly shapes into roughly a disc shape covering a thirty foot radius area. The mound then surges upwards, rising a hundred feet into the air in a massive, twisted column of bones and fossils. The tower is meant to trap both friend and foe in the air, removing all possible use of the environment; there are no obstacles, no earth, no water, and so on. However, there is an obvious huge supply of bones, making Zouge no Kioku techniques easy to use on the tower. At the user's behest or at the end of three posts, the bones slowly collapse from the bottom up, gently bringing the tower back to the ground. Once the tower has fallen, there is a two post cool down before Pale Tower may be used again.														
838	7	4	Shihaiteki Zouge - Ruling Ivory	Shihaiteki Zouge - Ruling Ivory	The last Ivory, this jutsu was clearly meant to create the Ruler, hence the name. From out of the ground comes a massive beast recognizable primarily from museums and dusty books. Usually, this manifests as something akin to a tyrannosaurus rex, using the full stats of the user including all their taijutsu bonuses. Other large, prehistoric animals of the same general size can be created, and all are gluttons for punishment. Unlike the other Ivories, these eat up their allotted chakra quickly and thus deanimate after three posts. They cannot use jutsu.

837	1	1	Mud Skin	Dorohifu	One of the simpler techniques meant more as a slight distraction, when the opponent is rushing forwards to attack, the user forms two handseals and casts this illusion on himself. If the target physically contacts the user, he is caught within the Mud Skin Technique. When the user moves to dodge, he leaves behind an illusory clone of mud that, when hit by the victim's hand or weapon, seems to harden slightly and becomes fairly gooey, making it somewhat laborious to pull back out of or retrieve the weapon. Duration: 1														
837	1	2	Rain Drop	Ame no Itteki	Obviously, a simple technique, it is triggered simply by having the target see the user complete a single hand-seal. Once this is done, the target will feel as if a drop of rain had just entered his eye, similar to an eye-drop. This is a distraction at best, and is simply to gain a minor degree of surprise. Duration: 1														
837	1	3	Cold Puddle	Kanbou Mizutamari	Not an incredible technique by any means, it still has at least application in battle. Essentially, upon having the target see the user finish off a chain of hand-seals and hearing him/her say the words 'My feet are getting cold'. From there, it seems that for the duration of the genjutsu, every single step the target takes, he is stepping into an extremely cold puddle, while barefoot. Duration: 1 - 3 - 6

837	2	1	Oil Hands	Aburate	After seeing the user form the handseals for this jutsu, the target then sees the user spit a glob of oil that hits and spreads all over their hands. No matter how hard the target tries to wipe the oil off, it remains on their hands. When they attempt to grip things, it feels loose and awkward in their hands, often causing them to fumble trying to constantly fix their grip. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5														
837	2	2	Storm Technique	Arashi no Jutsu	If anything, this technique is merely annoying to those who are put under its illusion. Following handseals, if and when the target hears the word "storm" (both alone or used in a phrase), the Genjutsu triggers. Clouds, if not previously present, accumulate overhead and immediately begin to spill water out of the sky, otherwise known as rain. The rain is rather loud as its splashes against the ground are amplified by the illusion, making it difficult to hear even oneself speak. The sheer amount of rain is enough to slightly disrupt the vision of the technique's victim, certainly not enough to induce blindness though. Additionally, the technique can create the illusion of tracks or scents that its user may have left behind. In actuality, their marks are still there, and the illusion simply masks them. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5														
837	2	3	Leech Rain	Hiru Ame	Triggered by a series of seals and having the target hear the user say "It's raining leeches", an illusion downpour begins- but in this case, instead of raindrops, it appears that it is raining leeches. Each of these leeches will latch on to the target and nibble, causing illusionary pain (overstatement) akin to getting bit by a mosquito. A nuisance at best. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5														
837	2	4	Oil Slick	Ando Sonji	This technique is triggered by a series of seals and then having the target hear the user say 'watch your step'. At that moment, the next step the target takes, the target seems to step onto an oil slick, which could mentally trick him/her into losing his/her footing or simply faltering. Duration: 1														
837	2	5	Haze Clone Skill	Enmu Bunshin no Jutsu	This jutsu, triggered after the user manipulates handseals and has the target(s) in sight, creates clones of the user. The clones themselves cannot actually interact with the real world much at all, being illusions, however any attacks against them will simply pass through them harmlessly. They are, however, complete illusions incapable of any real action, and are often used to tire down the unsuspecting opponent. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5

837	3	1	Sideways Rain	Yokoni Ame	A simple technique, triggered by a series of hand-seals and being heard by the target saying 'it's raining sideways', this genjutsu seems to make it appear to do just that. A moderately heavy downpour of rain seems to begin, with a twist, it seems to be raining on a completely horizontal axis, right into the target; illusory-wise, such a technique would effect the users visibility (water seems to be getting in ones eyes), mobility, and whatever else a sideways bout of rain may induce. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5														
837	3	2	Shelter from Rain	Amayoke	Requirement: Power 8, Control 6, Reserves 8 Triggered by a series of seals and hearing the user say 'shelter' in some way, this technique makes it seem, similar to various other rain genjutsu, that a downpour has begun. However, there is a twist - the user can at his discretion select a single area to be seemingly untouched by this illusionary rain. With this genjutsu in effect, the target is strongly compelled to get out of the rain and into this area, which could be perfect for springing a trap. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5														
837	3	3	Poisoned Mist	Kiridoku	With a gesture of the hand that is seen by the target(s) [this being the trigger], the targets are made to think that a rain pebble has been thrown at them which then immediately explodes into a huge toxic cloud. All those affected will then experience general numbness in each of their extremities. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5														
837	3	4	Rain Caltrops	Ame Tetsubishi	Triggered by a chain of hand-seals and making it so that the target hears the user say 'Don't step on that', this technique makes it seem as if a small downpour had fallen, and had left behind raindrops that somehow morphed into a decent-sized field of caltrops in anyone direction in relation the target (in between the target and the user, behind the target, etc). Illusionary pain-wise, they are not incredibly potent, barely matching up to the efficiency of mere makibishi. Duration: 1 - 3 - 5

837	4	1	Sharp Rainfall Technique	Eiri Uryou no Jutsu	A simple technique but known to drastically change the way a fight is going. Anything small such as dirt or rain that is falling on the target, is met with the stinging pain of a simple sewing needle. This is to say, something like a droplet of water would feel like the target's skin is being pierced by a needle. This technique first requires eye contact with the target while performing the handseals to trigger. Note: A handy fact of this technique is that it may be stacked with the Yokoni Ame (Sideways Rain) technique, for rather drastic effects. Duration: 1 - 2 - 4														
837	4	2	Waterweight Technique	Suioshi no Jutsu	After seeing the user complete the handseals, the target's senses are tricked into seeing/hearing/smelling/feeling/even tasting a drizzle of rain that slowly picks up into a moderate rain fall. They begin to feel as if their bodies are absorbing an extraordinary amount of water like a sponge. As such, for each post of the duration, the target feels like their burden has just been increased by twenty pounds, obviously reducing mobility. Duration: 1 - 2 - 4														
837	4	3	Rain of Cold Steel	Touken no Ame	Despite the implications of this technique, this does not at all cause any illusionary pain - rather, being quite the hindrance of a jutsu. After forming a hand-seal and having the target hears the user say the words 'Heads up' a downpour of rain seems to kick up; however, these rain droplets appear to actually be veritable katana. Each blade of rain will seem to land incredibly close to the target, although they will never actually hit- this genjutsu's purpose is to discourage the target from moving.

837	5	1	Maelstrom Technique	Kachuu no Jutsu	To trigger the illusion of this technique, the user must establish eye contact with his targets. The, a raging hurricane explodes in the area, tormenting all those the user made eye contact with while sealing. Their vision is reduced to two feet and they feel an icy cold wind and rain pierce into them through clothing and armor like small razors driven by a powerful force. The targets actually feel the pain as wind that seems to bear the consistency of razors slice into them and their clothing. Duration: 0 - 2 - 4														
837	5	2	Specter	Yurei	There have been rumors about creatures in the night, perhaps even shinobi that wander, performing clandestine operations within the village. Regardless, this technique plays upon those rumors and the fears that comes alongside them. Triggered by having the target witness the user performing hand-seals as well as hearing them say 'boo', suddenly it seems as if the user takes up the performance of a veritable demon, preying upon a fear that seems irrational. Ninja of the same rank would falter for only a second or so, while lower ranking ninja would be compelled to be stunned in their tracks. Duration: 1														
837	5	3	Infect	Utsusu	Requirement: Intelligence 18, Tactics 17, Willpower 17, Control 14 A technique with a sickening concept, it is triggered by making the target see the user finish off a chain of hand-seals and then hear them say 'Did you feel that?'. Instantly, the target will feel as if a droplet of rain has entered his ear. From then on, the rain will seem to act as if a bouncing ball ricocheting around in the target's cranium, inducing massive nausea and headaches. Duration: 0 - 2 - 4														
837	5	4	To be Found	Mitsukaru	For so long, rain shinobi have been escaping persecution and engaging in conflicts with the Rain Military. In this case, the user utilizes his knowledge and experience of the rain military to his own ends. Triggered by forming hand-seals and having the target(s) hear 'they're coming', an illusion of a large contingent of the military clashing with the shinobi is conjured. This causes a visual and auditory obstruction, the large mass of people obscuring sight, and the sounds of battle blocking out other noise. Meanwhile, the user himself is unhindered by this illusion, and with enough skill and stealthily take their opponent by surprise. Duration: 0 - 2 - 4

Ultimately, this jutsu has two facets two it. 1) The multitude of umbrellas in the air darkens the surroundings, blocking out the sun and most sources of light and 2) for the duration of this genjutsu, any offensive action taken by the target seems to be blocked by these impenetrable umbrellas. In reality, the offensive action had in no way been hindered by the umbrellas, but the visual cues seem to suggest such. Duration: 0 - 2 - 3														
837	6	2	Lonely Journey Technique	Ryoshuu no Jutsu	Requirement: Power 21, Control 20, Reserves 19, Intelligence 17, Tactics 15 This jutsu makes a group of target unable to see each other, even when standing right next to each other. They cannot see, hear or smell each other; all basic five senses deny the presence of their teammates. This jutsu works on groups of up to five people and remains active for as long as the weakest minded target is under the effects according to the genjutsu rules. This means that even if four of five targets realize they're in a genjutsu and are screaming to their teammates to snap out of it, all five still can't see or hear each other. Therefore, the main target is usually the weakest mental link. During this jutsu, it's easy to take down enemies one by one, leaving the weakest link standing to ensure the effects will last long enough. The trigger for this jutsu is for the targets to hear the user say, either by itself or in a sentence, "lonely". Duration: 0 - 2 - 3														
837	6	3	Armor of Oil	Anda no Gusoku	Requirement: Intelligence 23, Tactics 23, Willpower 22, Control 16, Reserves 15 A technique much less sinister in nature compared to the rest, but still formidable nonetheless. Essentially, after a chain of seals is carried out and the target hears the words 'You're dripping wet', the target believes every part of his body (including clothes, hands, feet) has been covered in an armor of oil. Now this oil seems to be incredibly sticky as well as slippery, which obviously negatively effects how the target is able to move, or associate with objects and etc around him (including weapons, hand-seals, actual movement). Duration: 0 - 2 - 3														
837	6	4	Freezing Rain	Reido Ame	Requirement: Power 23, Control 23, Reserves 22, Tactics 16, Willpower 15 Truly a cruel technique, it is triggered by performing seals and then having the target(s) witness the user pretend to shiver. Immediately, a downpour begins but this one is far crueler than the rest- on the first post, it is simply a normal bout of rain. However, with each following post within the duration, it becomes exponentially colder. On the second post, it becomes cold to the point of a stinging illusionary pain, while on the third; a massive leap of potency comes into effect, replicating the effects of frost-bite - effectively making it seem that the limbs are useless, and of course, frost-bite hurts like a bitch.

837	7	1	Requiem of Rain	Chinkonkyoku no Ame	One of the most potent Rain Genjutsu in the village's arsenal, Requeim of Rain calls forth an immense illusion. After completing the handseals, all the user must do is make sure his intended victims see him raise his hands to the sky. After that, a storm begins to brew. Soon after, a torrential downpour begins. It reduces visibility almost to blindness, makes trying to hear useless, and hammers down so forcefully the pellets seem to break through whatever they hit - trees, boulders, even metal. When hit by the rain drops, some of them feel like they shatter bones and pulverize flesh on contact, while others are as sharp as daggers, slicing through tendons, muscles, and ligaments with ease. Virtually every time the victims are brought to their knees from the severity of this technique, all while the user stands before them and watches their suffering. Duration: 0 - 1 - 3														
837	7	2	Hidden Sewer Technique	Fukuzai Koukyo no Jutsu	Warps the target's senses, all of them. The target suddenly comes upon the scene of a dirty sewer, reeking of corrosion and death. And yet, bodies are everywhere, floating amongst the gunky waters, and lying upon the rusted floors. The potent thing is that the user can be any one of those bodies. And the user can make all of the dead bodies come to life. They act like bunshins but they seem more real. When you hit them, you can feel them being hit and they just fall apart. When they hit you, you feel the pain of their attacks. After completing the handseals, the user must physically touch the target(s) to trigger the Genjutsu. Duration: 0 - 1 - 3														
837	7	3	Water Cycle	Kiri no Shouji	An incredibly, and incredibly punishing technique, this genjutsu embodies rain in an all so terrible fashion. Triggered by forming a set of hand-seals, touching the target and allowing a single target to hear the words 'the cycle has begun', the following occurs; in the first post of the duration the target plays the role of water within the cycle being evaporated, as such they feel an intense burning heat as well as the feeling of getting thoroughly ripped apart. Now, on the second post, they play the part of the gas, being compressed to form ice in the clouds, and that is no pleasant trip either; their organs, limbs seem to contort in ways unimaginable, causing even more unbearable pain. And then on the third and final post, as solids they feel as if they are torn apart once again, reverting back to 'Water'. If, by some chance, the duration is shortened - only the stages where the duration allows are carried out. Duration: 0 - 1 - 3														
837	7	4	Guardians	Kouken	They are the valiant guardian angels of the Amegakure, the ones who had given their lives when they had fled from the invading Kusagakure. They are zealots and fight as such; with conviction and vigor - and to their enemies, they are the very devil incarnate. Each post this genjutsu lasts, a Kouken jounin level seems to manifest and attacks the target, being nigh undefeatable, bearing what seems to be a perfect counter-move to everything the target throws at the illusion. And then when they strike, they strike hard- inducing illusionary pain all too real. Then, at the beginning of next post, a changing of the guard occurs, and a second Kouken takes over, and so on and so forth. Duration: 0 - 1 - 3

836	1	1	Acid Spit	Santoarukari Hakisuteru	Pretty plain and simple here, this jutsu merely makes the spit of a person acidic. It will cause first-degree burns to any skin it comes into contact with, eat away any piece of paper, eat through leaves, and smell really foul but that's about it.														
836	1	2	Oil Slick	Abura Ryuushutsu	This jutsu turns a puddle of water into an oil slick. The amount of water that is converted to oil is equal to the contents of a normal sized bucket of water. The oil is about one inch thick and can not be walked over by water or wall walking techniques. This ninjutsu can also be used through the use of Rain Pebbles. The maximum diameter of this jutsu is 16 feet.														
836	1	3	Lesser Oil Clone	Abura Bunshin: Karai	The tar version of the well-known Bunshin no Jutsu, this technique creates a sticky, gooey doppelganger of the user. The clone has 1/2 the character's speed (with bonuses) but only five percent (1/20) of his/her stamina and strength without bonuses. The clone may perform no jutsu and all physical attacks do no more damage that splashing oil. The clones' primary purpose is as a distraction, nothing more. They may not perform any jutsu.														
836	1	4	Oil Moat	Abura Hori	A moat of oil is created around the user. The oil is very slick and difficult to stand on. Only those with the oil walking ability may stand on it securely. The radius of the mote is 4 meters. The depth is 10 centimeters. Only the ground beneath the Rain-nin's feet remains solid, all else is converted into black crude oil.														
836	1	5	Oil Walking	Abura Aruki	This jutsu is pretty self-explanatory; it simply allows the Rain-nin to walk on oil. While this may not seem useful, when used in combination with any of the other oil techniques, this allows the Rain-nin a certain level of movement not available to the others on the battlefield.

836	2	1	Acid Edge	Santoarukari Fuchi	Through the use of this ninjutsu the shinobi may imbue any weapon with an acidic edge. The acid does not damage the weapon, but if it comes into contact with anyone it will burn skin and cause it to blister after two posts. It will also burn through any paper, and eat through leaves.														
836	2	2	Oil Skin	Abura Gaihi	Through the use of this ninjutsu the shinobi covers his/her skin in a fine layer of refined oil. The causes the shinobi to become very slick and has helped many to escape from a tight grip or being tied up. Lasts for three posts.														
836	2	3	Open Slot: Power 6, Control 6, Intelligence 4																
836	2	4	Tar Holding Bombs	Hasamu-Makkuro Bakudan	The Rain-nin uses this jutsu in conjunction with a Rain Pebble. The Rain Pebble is thrown and then explodes as the Rain-nin flashes chakra through it. When the Rain Pebble explodes it shoots out shrapnel of tar. If the tar lands on anyone, then it immediately increases in weight through chakra so that it weighs ten pounds. It is very difficult to wash off so that this becomes a great technique to use in slowing down an enemy or rambunctious genin. The blast radius is equal to one foot for every three power. The power of the blast itself is nothing more powerful than a slight breeze, this technique is about the tar, not the explosion. The tar will lose its chakra charge and added weight after three posts.														
836	2	5	Tar Missiles	Makkuro Dandoudan	Small golf ball sized projectiles may be launched from the earth toward a single target. The tar missiles do no other significant damage other than from the impact, though they usually splash over the target and cause a general sticky and unpleasant mess. Base Effect: 3 Missiles Stage Three Effect: 5 Missiles Stage Four Effect: 7 Missiles														
836	2	6	Acid Kawarimi	Santoarukari Kawarimi	This is similar to the academy body replacement technique in every way save in what replaces the shinobi. When a Rain-nin uses this technique a small explosion of acidic vapor will replace his/her body. The acid explosion is in the shape of the Rain-nin's body. The acid is strong enough to eat through clothing in two posts, give first-degree burns after one post and second degree burns after three posts. The acid will also cause metal and wood to become more brittle and easier to break. Please note that regardless of which kawarimi you use, it may only be used twice a thread. The acid only continues to have effect if you stay in the area of the acid (pretty foolish if you ask me, though occassionaly unavoidable).														
836	3	1	Acid Bomb	Santoarukari Bakudan	The Rain-nin can turn a Rain Pebble into an explosion of acid. The Rain Pebble simply blows up when the shinobi completes the final seal of the technique. The seal may be completed at any time he/she chooses. The diameter of the explosion is equal to one foot for ever two control of the Rain-nin. The acid is strong enough to eat through a one foot tree limb in four posts, one inch of metal in five posts, skin in two posts, and bone in three posts.														
836	3	2	Cannon Ball of Tar	Makkruohougan	The Rain-nin covers his arms in oil, water, or mud and then through the use of chakra changes the liquid into tar. The tar is launched off of the arms in the shape of two cannon balls. Once the cannon balls strike, they melt again into liquid tar.														
836	3	3	Black Rain Technique	Kokuu no Jutsu	A technique that causes oil to rain down from the skies in a circle with a diameter of fifty meters, the user in the middle. After the jutsu has been performed, this stationary rain will continue pouring over the afflicted area for two posts. Base Effect: Two Posts Stage Four Effect: Three Posts Stage Five Effect: Four Posts														
836	3	4	Tar Bats	Makkuro Henpuku	A horde of bats is created out of tar. The bats swarm around a group fluttering in and out. The bats do have claws, but they can only cut about two millimeters at the most. The bats last for three posts. When the end of those three posts comes, they lose their shape and become annoying blobs of sticky tar. Only one of the tar monster jutsu may be used at a time. Base Effect: 2 bats Stage Four Effect: 4 bats Stage Five Effect: 6 bats														
836	3	5	Greater Oil Clone	Abura Bunshin: Dainari	The mental and chakra stats of the Greater Oil Clone are equal to 1/3 the stats of the creator. The stamina and strength of the clone are equal to 1/6 of the creator's stats with bonuses while the speed is equal to the speed with bonuses. Each clone may perform one jutsu from the oil list that the user knows and it has the stats for. Once the clone has used a jutsu, it splashes into an oil puddle. Base Effect: 1 Clone Stage Four Effect: 2 Clones Stage Five Effect: 3 Clones														
836	3	6	Open Slot: Intelligence 10, Tactics 10, Reserves 8																
836	4	1	Tar Lances	Makkuro Hoko	Lances from tar are created and may be shot toward a single target. The lances are five feet long and once they penetrate two feet their hardened, sharpened form fades and they melt into liquid tar. Successive stages allow for the creation of more spears. Base Effect: 2 Spears Stage Five Effect: 4 Spears Stage Six Effect: 6 Spears														
836	4	2	Raining Spears of Tar	Makkurodou no Ame	A Rain Pebble is thrown into the air and tar begins to rain down over an area with a radius of 4 meters. As the tar rains down it stretches into four-foot long spears. The tips of the spears harden and while not particularly sharp, they rain down fast enough to be able to penetrate through three inches of stone. Once the spears penetrate they melt into molten, sticky tar once again.														
836	4	3	Acid Spout	Fukusantoarukari	A rain-nin places a Rain Pebble in his/her mouth and then spits it out. Once the pebble has traveled three inches it turns into a stream of liquid acid. The dangerous liquid shoots out like water through a garden hose. The spout of water is only 2 inches in diamter but has a range of 15 meters. This attack causes 2nd degree burns.														
836	4	4	Acid Cloud	Kumo Santoarukari	A rain pebble is converted into an acid gas bomb. The bomb explodes upon impact. The acidic gas extends into a dangerous cloud with a diameter of ten feet. This attack causes 2nd degree burns. The acid also burns through leaves, paper, and clothing in two posts. If inhaled it will burn the lungs and cause the individual to cough blood.														
836	4	5	Napalm Kunai	Napaamu Kunai	Napalm is what you get when you mix flammable refined oil with a gelatin. The gelatin makes the gas sticky and slows the rate it is consumed. This does not mean that the fire is any less intense; it merely means that the napalm burns longer than the pure gas and may actually cause the fire to stick to you. Successive stages allow multiple rain pebbles to be made into a kunai formed from napalm. These are not ignited upon creation, they merely can be ignited. Base Effect: 5 Kunai Stage Five Effect: 7 Kunai Stage Six Effect: 9 Kunai														
836	4	6	Open Slot																
836	5	1	Boiling Oil Downpour	Nemiminimizu Abura Gouu	A Rain Pebble is thrown into the air and acts as a catalyst for this jutsu. Oil rains down on an area with a diameter of 6 meters. The oil raining down is so hot that when it lands it continues to boil. This is no mere sprinkle it is a severe downpour. Four inches of oil pour down every post. This lasts for two posts.														
836	5	2	Tar Swamp	Makkurosawa	A large area is suddenly converted into a swamp of tar. The tar is a foot and a half thick and cannot be walked upon by anyone but the user of this technique. This is an excellent way to slow down enemies that are either fleeing or attacking. The area converted to the tar swamp has a length and width of 10 meters. The tar is rather annoyingly sticky.

836	5	4	Acid Rain	Santoarukari Ame	A rain pebble is thrown into the air and acid droplets begin to rain down on an area of 8 meters in diameter. The rain lasts for 3 posts. The acid will completely eat away the flesh after three posts (constant exposure is needed to do this); it weakens metal to make it become more brittle, leaves and paper catch fire, clothes are eaten away after the first post, small bits of metal are actually completely dissolved (like senbon). The acid will also catch any tar it touches on fire.														
836	5	5	Superior Oil Clone	Abura Bunshin: Ichidanto	The Superior Oil Clone has the complete stats of the user (with 1/3 taijutsu bonuses) and may perform one of the jutsu that its creator knows from this list (though it may not create another Superior Oil Clone). The clone still "lives" after performing the jutsu unless the jutsu is over stage 3, at which point it reacts as if hit mortally. After receiving a mortal blow, the clone splashes into a puddle of oil. 19 Power: 1 Clone may be created. -26 Power: 2 Clones may be created. -33 Power: 3 Clones may be created.

836	6	1	Napalm Rain	Naapamu no Ame	Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire. Deadly and dangerous napalm rains down upon an area with a 15 meter diameter. The flaming rain lasts for 3 posts.														
836	6	2	Boiling Oil Tsunami	Fuutoabura Tsunami	If you have ever seen a fifteen-foot towering wall of water rushing toward you, you will know terror. If you ever see a fifteen-foot towering wall of boiling oil charging toward you, you will taste of death. -Journal of a Mist-nin. The Rain-nin causes a tsunami of oil to rise up fifteen feet into the air and charge forward. The oil is heated through chakra so that it boils from within the tsunami. The width of the wave is 15 meters.														
836	6	3	Eagle's Wings	Washihane	They shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. The Rain-nin must be using Oil Skin. While using Oil Skin, the rain-nin converts part of the oil into wings of tar. The wings are each fifteen feet long and very lightweight. What do they do? You guessed it, they allow the rain-nin to soar through the sky. Be careful though, because if you fly too high[40 meters] you will, like Icarus, fall to the earth and die. The wings last for a total of 5 posts.

836	7	1	Napalm Dragon Typhoon	Naapamu Ryuu	The jutsu Napalm Rain is amplified through this jutsu. What started out as a steady rain is quickly transformed into a vortex of terror rotating around a peaceful eye where the rain-nin performing this jutsu stands. All around him/her for a radius of 30 meters napalm lashes out upon the ground. The napalm not only burns, it flies so fast that it leaves thin gashes in the skin. Trees are uprooted and destroyed. Things seem to disintegrate before the very vengeful eyes of the rain-nin. All throughout this storm, there seems to be heard the deep, malicious, and contemptuous roar of The Dragon.														
836	7	2	Acid Tsunami	Santoarukari Tsunami	Thirty meters high, and 20 meters wide, you do not want to be caught in the path of the Acid Tsunami. The acid will melt the flesh off of your bones in two posts. Skin, what skin? It only takes one post for the acid to completely eat away at your skin. Metal, you mean that used to be a sword? This acid will eat through an inch of metal per post. That tree had leaves? Leafy plant life is completely destroyed almost instantly. After traveling 50 meters, the acid evaporates into a harmless vapor.														
836	7	3	Tar Clone	Taaru Bunshin	One tar clone may be made at a time. The tar clone has the exact stats of the creator, including the taijutsu bonuses. The tar clone knows 2 jutsu from each stage of this list (excluding stage 7), and is able to perform it as long as it has the stats for it. The creator must specify upon its creation which jutsu it knows (spoiler tags please). The Tar Clone lasts until it receives a mortal blow. The tar clone cannot create a Tar Monster or be used at the same time as a Tar Monster tech.														
836	7	4	Acid Lake	Santoarukari Enko	A lake of acid with a radius of 60meters is created. Only land not being stood upon by a person is converted into the liquid acid (just the ground directly beneath their feet). This makes it so that enemy shinobi can be trapped onto small bits of land, but does not drown them immediately in acid. The acid lake is waist deep and cannot be walked upon by water walking. The acid will completely eat away the flesh after three posts; it weakens metal to make it become more brittle, leaves and paper catch fire, clothes are eaten away after the first post, small bits of metal are actually completely dissolved (like senbon).

835	1	1	Water Creation	Mizu Souken	While there isn't a shortage of water in Ame no Kuni, finding enough water for one's ninjutsu elsewhere can prove cumbersome. While more tiring to use than what water is already in the area, this jutsu is necessary in areas that do not have an abundant source of it. Mizu Souken, like its cousin jutsu from Kirigakure allows for the shinobi (or kunoichi) to draw water from the air itself to aid in their Mud or Water style techniques. - Stage Two: Can be used in Stage One techniques. -- Stage Three: Can be used in Stage Two techniques. --- Stage Four: Can be used in Stage Three Techniques (and so on.). Important Note: To perform Stage Seven ninjutsu, a natural large water supply must be present.														
835	1	2	Muddy Shoes Technique	Dorogutsu no Jutsu	Following a lone hand seal from the user, the ground beneath the target turns into a small pit of mud that sticks and gives a weak pull on the enemy's feet. Now, while not strong enough to fully restrain a target, it allows a split second in which the user can follow with a more powerful attack.														
835	1	3	Breath of Vapor	Toikino Suijouki	The first jutsu that truly adheres to the 'Shirou Suiton' name, this jutsu (while also exhaled from the mouth) creates a steady plume of white mist that covers the sight of the target for a brief span of time, as well as causes the enemy to cough as the mist gets into the nose and mouth.														
835	1	4	Mist Clone Technique	Kiri Bunshin no Jutsu	For what passes as an exact copy of the user, the Mist Clone is exceptionally offensively weak, having almost no real attack strength of its own. On the other side, it also doesn't have much strength on the defensive side either, although like any other Bunshin, if it takes a solid hit (it will shrug off a glancing blow), it will disperse in a fine spray of mist. The only real attack the Mist Clone has is that it will rush the enemy and attempt to choke him or her by stuffing itself down the opponent's mouth and nose in an attempt to suffocate them. One Bunshin is created at this stage. - Stage Two: Three Bunshin are created. -- Stage Three: Five Bunshin are created.

835	2	1	Mud Ball Technique	Dorotama no Jutsu	Although a simple jutsu, Dorotama is the first true offensive technique of Shirou Suiton that is taught to upcoming Rain shinobi. By focusing chakra into the mouth, the user creates and spits out fist-sized globs of mud at the opponent. This ball hits with a concussive strength level of two and upon landing on any surface, quickly dries and hardens into a brittle clump of dirt. Three globs are launched with this technique. - Stage Three: Five globs are launched and hits with a strength level of three. -- Stage Four: Seven globs are launched with no change in strength.														
835	2	2	Water Sight Technique	Suitoraeru no Jutsu	As a spying technique, Suitoraeru allows for the shinobi creating and 'seeing' or just seeing from an existent, but relatively small source of water at the expense of their normal sight (in short, if you can see through the water, you cannot see normally.). This jutsu allows the user to see everything that the puddle sees: everything reflected on, around or underneath the surface. The source of the water may only as big as a puddle of water. This sight lasts for three posts maximum.														
835	2	3	Water Needles Technique	Suidoru no Jutsu	By manipulating an available water source, or created one via Mizu Souken, the user can create Senbon needles. The needles can be either collected and thrown by hand or launched as they are created towards a target. These needles of water are as capable as normal senbon in terms as lethality, but after they strike, they lose solid form an turn back into basic water. User creates five needles. - Stage Three: User creates ten needles. -- Stage Four: User creates fifteen needles.														
835	2	4	Water Lily	Suiren	An innocent name for a destructive technique: this jutsu allows the user to make small amounts of water explode into a barrage of needle-like drops that would remind one of hailstones. The affected water spreads out in all directions and cannot be controlled by the user - posing a danger to their creator if he is not careful. Fully capable of cutting through clothing and causing skin lacerations this technique can be extremely surprising and thus handy. The maximum amount of water that can be used depends on the user's proficiency at ninjutsu. Initially, half a litre can explode. - Stage Three: A liter water can explode. -- Stage Four: Two liters of water can explode.

835	3	1	Mud Wall Technique	Doroheki no Jutsu	This move creates a barrier between the user and whatever he desires. When this wall springs up it is wade of compacted mud, a substance - that while not particularly solid - is capable of sapping a great deal of force from any physical attack that should come into contact with it and of course a barrier is still a barrier when it comes to more exotic forms of attack. On the user's next post the mud wall hardens and dries out. And while usually fairly brittle, a Jounin's dried mud wall might as well be stone. The wall itself is 5 feet by 5 feet and can block Stage Two Ninjutsu. - Stage Four: The wall can block Stage Three Ninjutsu, and two feet are added onto the base dimensions. -- Stage Five: The Wall can block Stage Four Ninjutsu, and three feet are added onto the base dimension.														
835	3	2	Arms of the Octopus	Ude no Taku	Quite the handy entrapment technique, it works best at close to medium range encounters. With a string of hand-seals, four tendrils - about eight feet long at the max - of hardened mud emerge from the user's sleeves and spring towards the target; they are aiming to envelope the target. Quite effective for a relatively simple technique, it takes a base strength of level 3 to extricate oneself from these bonds. Otherwise, these bonds loosen after two rounds of posting; provided the user hasn't already taken advantage of the target while they were entangled. - Stage Four: Six tendrils are created. -- Stage Five: Eight tendrils are created.														
835	3	3	Mud Clone Technique	Doro Bunshin no Jutsu	A jutsu that creates a clone made of mud from the earth. Compared to the weaker Kiri Bunshin, this Bunshin is capable of attacking with a rounded third of the user's stats (including taijutsu bonuses). Not only can the Doro Bunshin can use one jutsu from the Shirou Suiton list once per thread, given it has the appropriate stats for it, it's body is also manipulatable. Manipulation is limited to weapons and it can't become something greater than it is. One clone is created. - Stage Four: Two clones are created. -- Stage Five: Three clones are created.														
835	3	4	Twenty Lashes	Nijuu Kankuuhan	Completing the required hand seals, the user exhales a cloud of mist that is very similar to the Breath of Vapor Technique. However, this cloud is spewed out faster and over a wider area than its predecessor - the plume creating a large cone that envelopes all it touches. Enemy's caught inside this vapor find themselves being struck as if by whips. These strikes rip through clothing and strike hard enough to draw blood from skin. Though the injuries rarely prove fatal, the pain from these lashes can be enough to drive people into shock and at the very least it severely hampers muscle movement. It covers a similar area to the Breath of Vapor - though the cone is 18ft long and 9ft at its largest point instead of the previous dimensions.

835	4	1	Mud Dragon Technique	Doryu no Jutsu	This jutsu, evidently summons a winged, imposing dragon of mud - aesthetically, it may vary from user to user. However, one thing remains constant - their incredibly versatility. Its claws of mud may rend, while its sharp fangs can serve the same purpose. In one additional twist, the draconic entity may also utilize the Mud Ball technique (at stage 3 level) instead of its typical methods of attack. Stage 4 ninjutsu or Level 4 strength may destroy this dragon. Only one may be in existence at any time and the jutsu lasts for three posts.														
835	4	2	Quagmire Technique	Shoutaku no Jutsu	A highly refined version of Dorogutsu no Jutsu, Shoutaku is no longer as harmless as its predecessor is. With a string of hand seals, the ground beneath an enemy's feet in an eight foot circle turns to mud, instantly swallowing them to their ankles if they aren't quick enough to escape (within one post). From there, this technique rivals any from of quicksand in lethality: Slowly, the afflicted person is sucked into and devoured by the mud. It takes three posts for the enemy to be completely buried and once they are completely sucked in, the Quagmire turns back into basic earth and can be escaped normally if the target has not suffocated by this time.														
835	4	3	Driving Rain Technique	Furissagu no Jutsu	Summoning his chakra, the Rain shinobi looks to the sky and causes it to grow dark with ominous clouds. The air grows damp and humid and the smell of rain in the air is almost overwhelming. In the initial post, a light rain begins to fall down from the chakra created clouds that within the next post becomes what one might call a torrential downpour of rain. This rain obviously, is not a normal one. This chakra-aided rain obscures the senses and distorts any sounds made within the downpour, other than that of the rain itself. This technique is similar to Kirigakure's namesake technique in that, even the user cannot see through it without either already knowing how to fight without vision or having a technique that sees through it (White Clairvoyance). Lasts for three posts. - Stage Five: Lasts for four posts. -- Stage Six: Lasts for five posts.														
835	4	4	Mud Instantaneous Body Skill	Doro Shunshin no Jutsu	Using chakra to turn their body into mud, the user sinks into the ground below, removing them from sight. The user then reappears (with the process happening in reverse) up to a mile away from where they were previously. The user can only appear in a location he or she has seen before. Just like with any other Shunshin, this may only be used for escaping a thread.														
835	4	5	Water Breathing	Kokyuuhou	A simple and passive technique that may end up being most handy in numerous situations, the Water Breathing Technique allows the shinobi to use his chakra to sustain himself for short periods of time should he be unable or not want to breathe. This technique lasts 3 posts. - Stage Five Effect: The technique lasts 4 posts. -- Stage Six Effect: The technique lasts 5 posts.														
835	4	6	Open Slot																
835	5	1	Quagmire Clone Technique	Shoutaku Bunshin no Jutsu	This clone created from both mist and mud is the strongest of the Bunshin in this list. With the same stats of that of its creator (along with a third of their bonuses), its body is manipulatable, like its weaker variant -- the Doro Bunshin, meaning that it's arms and legs are able to be shaped into weapons. It can't become something outrageous though (meaning it can't become bigger than it already is or anything like that.). It can use one ninjutsu from this list before returning to its natural state. Only one Bunshin can be made at one time.														
835	5	2	Geyser	Kanketsusen	An attack designed to remove a tightly clustered group of enemies, the Geyser jutsu forces a huge spout of water to erupt from the ground - the attack hitting an area of eight feet in diameter - with enough force to break bones or fling an enemy far, far into the air. After the initial burst, the spout of water falls away from the center and floods the immediate area with water.														
835	5	3	Pressure Spear	Hokosakino Asshuku	Water is a dangerous element and, like many elements, at high speeds it is even more so. This technique, the Pressure Spear, forces an incredible volume of water into a space as wide as a tennis ball before projecting it outwards in a long stream with extreme force. This technique is capable of slicing through solid stone without fail and even metal cannot resist this technique indefinitely. Needless to say, a human must be wary of such a move - especially considering the long range this jutsu can be performed at. Only one spear can be fired, the spear can reach 50 feet and takes two shots to break through metal. - 25 Power: The spear can reach 60 feet. -- 32 Power: The spear can reach 70 feet. - 25 Control: It takes one shot to break through metal. -- 33 Control: The spear punches through metal without trouble. - 26 Reserves: Two spears can be fired. -- 35 Reserves: Three spears can be fired.														
835	5	4	Cat 'o Nine Tails	Kyuubi no Neko	When this jutsu is performed mist bursts from the user's body in any direction he pleases, covering a large area and subjecting those caught within it to numerous, repeated slashes in much the same way as the Twenty Lashes technique. These can score stone and slash trees with equal ease. Needless to say, such a move is quite a powerful addition to any shinobi arsenal; if exposed to this jutsu for long enough, death is fully within its reach. The mist extends from the user in a 15ft diameter circle.														
835	5	5	White Clairvoyance Technique	Shirou Senrigan no Jutsu	A technique created almost solely to supplement the Driving Rain Technique, the White Clairvoyance technique allows the user to see through heavy rain or the specifically white mist that is used in many of the stronger Shirou Suiton jutsu. This does not give the ability to see through smoke or mist, however. The technique is passive and activates when the user's vision would otherwise be obstructed by Shirou Suiton jutsu.														
835	5	6	Open Slot																
835	6	1	Rising Blast	Tachinoboru Happa	With a string of hand seals, the user conjures worth a massive volume of water that immediately rushes in the direction of his choice. This veritable tidal wave is capable of sweeping people away, crushing people to death and drowning the survivors in its torrent. Those who escape this technique will find the battle field changed into a waterlogged version of itself - providing an intrinsic advantage to any water or mud-using shinobi. Thankfully, this move takes a lot of chakra to perform and isn't a move to be used lightly. Cannot be used in succession.														
835	6	2	Water Wall	Suijinheki	A high level defensive technique, Suijinheki projects a cylindrical wall of torrential water around the user. This barricade is not only reinforced with chakra, but the sheer speed at which the water rushes out from the user (essentially 'away' from them) also deflects or possibly destroys the oncoming attack. This jutsu is lasts for one post as a base, but as such a high-level technique, it cannot be used in consecutive posts without a cool down of one post. After the jutsu ends, the water crashes down and flows normally. - 25 Intelligence: The wall lasts for two posts. -- 29 Intelligence: The wall lasts for three posts. - 24 Tactics: Stage Five Ninjutsu and Stage Four Taijutsu is blocked. -- 28 Tactics: Stage Six Ninjutsu and Stage Five Taijutsu is blocked.														
835	6	3	Tempest Torment	Suinamo no Arashi	Clasping his hands together, the user causes a single target within sight to suddenly find water begin to swirl up from the ground around him - giving the poor soul a chance to escape - but catching him inside a whirling vortex of water should he fail. Trapped inside, the unlucky foe is subject to being tossed and flailed around like a ragdoll within. Breaths are ripped out from the target's lungs and they are rendered unconscious soon after. This jutsu only lasts for a single post, but a single post would probably feel like a eternity inside. This jutsu is substantially quicker to initiate when actually atop a body of water.														
835	6	4	Phantom Assailant Technique	Yuurei Kagaisha no Jutsu	A technique that can only be used in conjunction with the other mist techniques, the Phantom Assailants Jutsu causes any mist affected in this way to linger on the battlefield for an unnatural length of time. This now enchanted mist is suddenly possessed with malice enough to cause it to seek out nearby targets and attempt to restrain and asphyxiate them by clinging to their bodies, wrapping around their necks and forcing its way into their lungs with equal fervour. This move lasts for 3 posts and any mist introduced after its casting is also affected by it.

835	7	1	Nightmare Rain Technique	Numa Ame no Jutsu	A technique that can only be classed as Village Destruction. The sky is filled with pitch black clouds from horizon to horizon - stifling any source of light from a above - and plunging the affected area (which is 90 feet squared) into darkness. Thunder claps high above and lighting streaks between clouds. Then it begins to rain, it begins to rain harder than any tempest. However, this water is no ordinary water. At first, enemies under this technique will simply think it is a normal storm and for the first post of this jutsu it will be. Starting on the user's next post though the rain suddenly becomes razor sharp. The droplets elongate and turn into scything needles that blast their way through flesh, wear down stone and even damage metal should they be given enough time to do so. Wise enemies will seek a way to protect themselves as they leave the area before they are torn to shreds while the user and his allies suffer only as much harm as normal rain can muster. This deadly rain lasts two posts and covers an area of 100 feet around.														
835	7	2	Stagnant Death	Shisui Shikyo	This jutsu could almost be termed a summoning technique. Out of nowhere a huge and sickly swamp, roughly 90 feet in diameter, transplants the original terrain. Gnarled, decaying trees suffocated by parasitic vines as the only noticeable 'life' here. Everything else is simply mud. This mud however is actually a malicious and evil spirit that seeks nothing more than to devour still warm flesh. And devour it attempts to do - the mud reaching out with hooked tendrils to strike, impale and then drag its prey down underneath its inescapable depths. A persistent foe, defeating these tentacles hardly even slows it down in its ravenous quest. However, to perform this technique the user must go into a state of torpor so complete that it can be mistaken for death. This leaves the user completely unable to defend himself calling to the mud to shield his fragile body and any strike that touches the user will wake him and end the jutsu instantly. This technique may be used safely for 3 posts, 4 posts will cause the user to be drained of the chakra he uses to satiate the swamp and after post 5, the user will be eaten as a sacrifice.														
835	7	3	Liquid Assassin	Ekijou Kyoushu	A truly incredible technique that allows the user to become water: with full control over shape, and density. Practical immunity to many attacks - nearly all of the phyiscal kind - is granted through this technique and its long duration and remarkable efficiency make for a powerful weapon. This is not to say the user is completely invincible though. Indeed, every drop of water they loose is a scratch sustained when this jutsu wears off. Regular water cannot repair the damage done and only by gathering what was lost can something like that be possible - even if such small amounts of water will usually disappear before the user can retrieve them (though because they can retrieve them to an extent one huge blunt impact isn't instantly fatal). The user may remain in this state for six posts.

Created with elemental seals, allowing the wearer to passively absorb large quantities of their preferred element as they walk. In Ame no Kuni this usually means soaking in water, mud, or oil, but could conceivably store (and release) any element that makes could otherwise be stored in a gourd. Each post of activation while in the vicinity of the element will allow the stocking to absorb one large gourd of material per stocking. Cannot absorb elemental attacks or jutsu this way. Base Effect: One large gourd of material per post Stage Two: Can release stored element all at once, much like popping a balloon. Stage Three: Stored elements can be shot out from the foot with the pressure of a fire hose.

834	2	1	The Spider Sarashi	The Spider Sarashi	Woooooosh! - unidentified Shichou child Takes the form of bands of bandage-like material worn around the torso or abdomen, or any sash-like apparel in general. When active, the 2 strips of the sarashi will shoot out and wrap around whatever it is they connect with. Then, if the wearer wishes, they may 'rewrap' the sarashi, either pulling themselves towards where the ends have landed, or to pull the ends back towards themselves. The 'pull' does not exceed the speed or strength of the wearer. The material is of course easy to cut. 5 yards of sarashi may be extended per maximum stage of this list known.														
834	2	2	Disposable Sandal	Disposable Sandal	Even trash has its uses. -Shichou Karan Takes the form of open toe footwear. When active, the sandal is indestructible for one post, allowing for walking on sharp, hot, or otherwise dangerous substances without fear of breaking. The following post it disintegrates. While the sandal itself will survive nearly any impact, the foot on the other side is still very much vulnerable. 2 sandals are created, and they may be activated independently. Stage Four: The sandal does not disintegrate in the next post, but is not longer indestructible. Can reactivate after a 1 post cooldown.														
834	2	3	Gloves of the Callow	Gloves of the Callow	Like being caressed by a mosquito's sigh. -Shichou Tenma Takes the form of thin gloves, which can be fingerless and up to elbow length. When active, nothing the fingers or hand touches will be felt by others (though they can still be seen). Any weapons or tools used will still be felt, but any attacks made while the gloves are active will have the pain numbed until the gloves deactivate. Stage Three: Small tools such as needles or scalpels will not cause pain, though they will be felt. Stage Four: Gloves worn on injured or broken hands may still perform hand seals.														
834	2	4	Lifejacket	Lifejacket	Why learn water walking when you could wear this at half the price! -Shichou Liru Takes the form of a bulky, thick vest, reminiscent of shinobi flak jackets. When activated, wounds on the wearer will not bleed, though structural damage and pain caused by injuries still applies. Also passively provides a limited, one-time defense to taijutsu and ninjutsu, though it will disintegrate against any attack regardless of stage. Also floats in water. Base Stage: Defends against stage one jutsu and level one strength Stage Three: Defends against stage two jutsu and level two strength Stage Four: Defends against stage three jutsu and level three strength														
834	2	5	Wig of Woe	Wig of Woe	Time heals all wounds. And grows back the missing hair. -Shichou Yue Takes the form of artificial hair, which can be worn but probably shouldn't be. When the wig is active it seems to gain a life of its own, and will viciously and relentlessly attempt to assert its dominance by attaching itself to the closest non-Shichou it can find (while trying to pull out the hair that's already there). The wig has level one in all stats and when mobile is like a living tangle of razor wire, capable of leaving a multitude of skin-deep cuts and tears. Stays active for two posts, even if cut in twain [Yue protip: Fire keeps it down!]. Stage Three: Level two physical stats Stage Four: Lasts three posts. Stage Five: If the wig is successful in scalping a target, another stage five Wig of Woe will be created from the torn out hair.														
834	2	6	Dressed for Success	Dressed for Success	Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. -Shichou Karan Passive technique. The Shichou possesses a kind of 'sixth sense' when it comes to shinobi fashion- specifically, they tend to know what to wear before they realize they need to wear it. This lets the Shichou start a thread with 1 stage one garment already created and worn. Consumes a usage itself as well as a usage from the clothing stage created, and all other clothing rules still apply. Stage Three: Stage Two clothing may be prepped Stage Four: Stage Three clothing may be prepped Stage Five:Stage Four clothing may be prepped														
834	3	1	Hat Trick	Hat Trick	Shinobi work can be quite an odd job, at times. -Shichou Yue Takes the form of head wear, usually no larger than a baseball cap. When active, the brim of the hat (or whatever the equivalent might be) becomes razor sharp, and the hat itself spins and takes off like a hawk into the air in search of prey. The hat will remain in the air and swoop down and attack anyone the wearer vocally commands it to, for either 2 posts or until it is struck down. About as lethal as a fuuma shuriken. Can be activated even when not worn, such as after throwing or if left anywhere the Shichou can see. Possesses level two physical stats. [Yue protip: Don't put it back on until its finished!] Stage Four: 3 post duration Stage Five: Level four physical stats														
834	3	2	Spectacles of the Seer	Spectacles of the Seer	You wouldn't hit a guy in glasses, would you? -Shichou Berzachi Takes the form of a pair of glasses or sunglasses, usually made of metal but plastic and even fabric can suffice. When activated provides an 'augmented' view of reality, listing information such as distances to objects in line of sight, general location of allies, and relative speeds of objects in motion. This augmented vision does not provided any enhanced vision capabilities (no night vision, thermal, etc) and cannot be used to determine what is and isn't a genjutsu. Also provides fairly accurate weather forecasts. Stage Five: Object mass, structural integrity (how easy is it to break), and fingerprints may now all be seen as well.														
834	3	3	Handbag	Handbag	Good place to keep extra coats. -Shichou Wang Takes the form of any fabric bag, which can be as big as a duffel bag or as small a coin purse. When activated, anything 'inside' the bag will be 'absorbed', disappearing (but in reality being sealed inside the fabric). Body parts sealed this way are in stasis and can't be healed or used to form techniques, but once unsealed will 'pop' back into existence with no injury having been incurred. Shichou pranksters sometimes scare children in the sewers by pretending to be headless, for example. Can theoretically store a closet worth of material. Can be used on hostile targets, but will only bind items/body parts for a single post in that case. Stage Four: Wearer may 'store' their entire body in the bag for a single post, consuming a kawarimi usage. Stage Five: Two bags may be created, with 'stored' items being transported between them instead.														
834	3	4	Father's Belt	Father's Belt	Spare the rod, spoil the Shichou. -Shichou Koko Takes the form of a strip of fabric usually worn around the waist or hips but more generally is any narrow length of material worn around a body part. When activated, the belt whips out and around the wearer in a 6 foot radius plus 2 more feet for each stage known in this list, centered on wherever it is being worn. Hits as hard and as fast as the Shichou can, and inflicts a stinging pain (though not damage) even through layers of armor and cloth. Allegedly hurts more for targets feeling guilt. Stage Four: The belt may cut like a knife. Stage Five: The belt may wrap around and entangle one enemy, requiring greater strength than the wearer to break free.														
834	3	5	Veil of Ignorance	Veil of Ignorance	The nail that stands tallest gets hammered first. -Shichou Tenma Takes the form of a thin material worn over the head, usually added on as part of a shirt but can be worn without as well. When activated, the wearer is functionally invisible unless looked at directly (IE, only invisible in peripheral vision). The wearer can still be heard, smelled, etc, and will become visible immediately if they attack. Stage Four: The wearer can talk over communication units and not be heard. Stage Five: The wearer is imperceptible to all but chakra enhanced senses (and being looked at directly).														
834	3	6	Open Slot																
834	4	1	Dragon's Hood	Dragon's Hood	I hate a sloppy fight. -Shichou Hei Takes the form of a head or face covering material that can be worn separately or attached to an existing piece of clothing. When activated (or activated by pulling the hood down, from whatever source), a tremendous stream of scalding hot steam will escape from the 'face' of the hood, blinding and injuring those in the immediate vicinity. If the wearer knows other elemental ninjutsu, that element can be substituted instead of steam. The spray fills a 15 meter radius and lasts 2 posts, obscuring vision. Stage Five: 30 meter radius, lasts 3 posts														
834	4	2	Tunic of the Three Lords	Tunic of the Three Lords	Courage is overcoming fear. So more fear means more courage, right? -Shichou Uryu Takes the form of a sleeveless shirt, usually knee length but can be of any size or material (and, if desired, with sleeves). When activated, the garment will tighten around the wearer and increase its weight. This reduces breathing, speed, strength, and restricts chakra usage (reduces all physical stats to level 1, no jutsu above stage one may be used). After the hold is released the wearer feels tremendously better, gaining a +1 bonus to all physical levels equal to the number of posts the tunic was active after the first, as well as a 1-time boost in scaling to the next jutsu they use (if applicable). If the tunic is damaged at all while 'charging', no boost is given. The maximum boost achievable is +4. Stage Five: If the tunic is active for longer than 3 posts, the stat increase lasts for two posts instead.														
834	4	3	Blunder Blindfold	Blunder Blindfold	It's only a mistake if I notice it. -Shichou Yue Takes the form of a strip of cloth wrapped horizontally around the eyes, which does not necessarily have to blind the wearer. Once activated however it will cause blindness for two posts, regardless of whether it is removed or not. This blindness is complete- even visual genjutsu illusions will not affect it (though sounds, feelings, etc are still affected normally). While blind the wearer gains profound insight to the world around them, or so they think. In actuality, while they might be able to slowly navigate rooms they saw prior to activation, they are still very much blind. Two Shichou ninjutsu may be used per post so long as the blindfold is active. Stage Five: The blindness may last as long as the wearer wills it to.														
834	4	4	Wading Trousers	Wading Trousers	Leave the worst behind you. Look to tomorrow! -Shichou Berzachi Takes the form of a pair of trousers of any color, usually extending to the ankle but can be of any size or length. When activated any non-living surface the wearer walks on is liquefied. The 'liquid' surface extends outward 3 feet by 3 feet and downward 6 feet (or however deep the surface goes). The liquid itself is thick like mud but will cause those who touch it to sink. The surface re-hardens after 2 posts, trapping whoever or whatever might be inside. Stage Five: Three post duration.														
834	4	5	FIERCE FABRIC	FIERCE FABRIC	The fash that bites back! No refunds. -Shichou Liru Takes the form of any flat sheet of cloth tied around the neck, usually worn as a cape or cloak. When activated the fabric resonates and vibrates rapidly and acts something like a cross between a sander and a grater. Any substance (apart from the wearer) touching the fabric will be shredded. After one post this can reduce skin to raw muscle, after two it can churn flesh down to the bone. Similarly it takes two posts to chew through most substances. Can be activated and thrown, where it will then eat through whatever non-metal surface it lands on for the duration. Lasts two posts. Stage Five: Lasts 3 posts and can destroy thick materials in one post.														
834	4	6	Open Slot																
834	5	1	Solemn Straitjacket	Solemn Straitjacket	Really takes the edge off, along with everything else. -Shichou Uryu Takes the form of an extra long sleeved, many belted shirt. When activated the jacket binds the wearer's arms to their chest, rendering them unable to use those limbs. While bound the wearer feels no emotion or pain, and will not succumb to hunger, thirst, lack of oxygen, or the elements. As a cost, their strength and speed are reduced to level 1. The jacket itself can shrug off physical blows equal to or lower than the wearer's stamina, and ninjutsu equal or lower than Stage Five, with no damage sustained. However the wearer can still bleed out if wounded. The jacket may also be activated when worn by others, sealing their arms until the jacket is destroyed or removed. Functionally worthless in combat as getting the jacket on a person takes an entire post, thus is used mostly for prisoner transport and desperate defenses. Lasts an entire thread after activation, or until destroyed or removed by another person.														
834	5	2	Antique Scarf	Antique Scarf	You never forget your first. - Shichou Koko Takes the form of a long, narrow stretch of material, usually worn around the neck but could be worn anywhere. When activated the scarf gains the sharpness of a blade and durability of steel without losing its flexibility. Can be thrown like a javelin, swung like a sword, balled up and smashed around like a club, folded and used as a shield, creased and used as a hook, and so on, and so on, and so on. The scarf itself can extend as far as 25 yards when active, but otherwise retains its normal size and properties. Intelligence 24: Two scarves may be created at once. Intelligence 31: Scarves will regenerate if damaged. Tactics 23: 35 yard length Tactics 30: 45 yard length Willpower 23: Scarf-like properties may be imbued to any piece of clothing the Shichou makes. Willpower 30: Any piece of existing clothing may be turned into an Antique Scarf														
834	5	3	Cloak of the Horizon	Cloak of the Horizon	Who are you when nobody is watching? -Shichou Tenma Takes the form of a long, usually body length cloth, connected around the collar. When activated, it begins to absorb all sources of light in a 50 meter radius, plunging everything but itself into darkness. No light from outside will fall on anything but the cloak. There is not even enough light for night vision techniques to work, though doujutsu or techniques that function on senses other than light-based sight still work. If the cloak is removed, the darkness remains centered where it falls. The cloak itself doesn't glow or emit light when active- it is simply the only thing that can be 'seen' in its area of effect (unless something is between it and the observer). Absorbs only light, not energy. Jutsu which produce light (like katon or raiton) will be invisible, but still 100% usable. Lasts three posts. Control 25: 75 meter radius Control 32:Lasts indefinitely (or until the cloak is destroyed)														
834	5	4	Ubermensch Overcoat	Ubermensch Overcoat	I don't predict the weather. I am the weather. -Shichou Berzachi Takes the form of a heavy jacket, which can extend down to the feet or only up to the lower torso if desired. When activated by opening the coat (either on purpose or by an enemy), an immense storm is blown from underneath, complete with wind, rain, hail, mud, and thunder (the wearer controls what 'gets out'). If the coat is cast away entirely, the storm will completely escape, encompassing the battlefield in a massive (but still fairly mundane) storm covering a 250 yard in radius after one post. The storm finishes at the end of 3 posts with a mighty blast of rain which floods the battlefield. Afterwards, the weather will be quite pleasant and sunny.														
834	5	5	Hell's Heel	Hell's Heel	Imagine an e-tag exploding in a human face- forever. -Shichou Karan Takes the form of large, usually heavy footwear, though can take any form so long as it is worn on the feet. When activated, the wearer may cause small but powerful explosions underneath the boots. The boots are immune to explosions, and with good technique a wearer can kick off the ground and 'explosion jump' to great heights or across great distances (though this will obviously be quite noisy). Control 26: Explosions maybe 'controlled', causing only local or e-tag sized damage if need be. Control 33: Completely silent explosions may be caused. Power 26: The boots may also cause an explosion when 'landing', with no damage being sustained by the wearer. Power 33: Explosions may be augmented with any elemental list the wearer knows (IE, an oil explosion would spray oil in all directions, a mud explosion mud, etc).														
834	5	6	Open Slot																
834	6	1	Battle Fatigues	Battle Fatigues	Two of you, for the price of one! -Shichou Liru Takes the form of a military uniform, which can be altered depending on location and mission. When activated the fatigues are shed but retain their shape, effectively acting like a single bunshin for the Shichou. The fatigues have stats equal to the Shichou plus bonuses, and at any time the clothing may 'jump' onto another willing person and bestow them with the exact same stats as the Shichou (provided this wouldn't lower their stats in the first place). Can take a beating and will only fall apart from stage five and below ninjutsu or taijutsu levels exceeding the Shichou's own, or deactivate on its own after 3 posts.														
834	6	2	Headband of the Hero	Headband of the Hero	If you are going to fail, fail big. -Last words of prodigy Shichou Yue Takes the form of a strip of cloth around the head, usually worn alongside a hitai-ate. When activated, all remaining usages are consumed and the wearer's body begins to glow. The wearer may then perform a single jutsu, which is multiplied by 9 minus its stage (so a stage 1 jutsu would be 'cast' 8 times, stage two cast 7 times, etc). Leaves the body with just enough chakra to not die, but the wearer cannot move or act afterwards (speaking and breathing are fine). [Yue protip: You're on your own now.]														
834	6	3	Coverall	Coverall	The past is a terribly cold place to dwell. -Shichou Wang Takes the form of an entire bodysuit, up to and including an airtight helmet, like a hazmat suit. When activated, the body inside reverts to the exact condition it was in 3 posts prior. This includes reverting injuries, poisons, memories, and even genjutsu (including durations, if the wearer was under one). Does not revert chakra usages, cooldowns, stat penalties, or death. The reverting takes an entire post, where the wearer is helpless. Cool down of 3 posts. Control 30: Can revert up to 4 posts prior Control 37:2 post cooldown														
834	6	4	Skin of the Sycophant	Skin of the Sycophant	I'm just going to borrow it. -Last words of the traitor Shichou Tenma Takes the form of a fabric bodysuit, which is usually seamless leather or rubber. The skin passively grants immense regenerative abilities, allowing the wearer to come back from fatal wounds and even reattach severed limbs. The cost is blood. All blood is drained from the wearer in the first post after donning the skin, and they must find and consume another living human's blood (killing them in the process) in the same post or die. One body's worth of blood must be absorbed per post to maintain the regeneration. The skin can be safely removed after consuming the blood. To consume blood all that is necessary is for the skin to make contact with an open wound on a freshly killed body, a process which takes a couple seconds at most. Intelligence 30: The skin may be made from a slain person, negating the initial blood cost. Intelligence 37: The skin may be made from many persons, storing the blood of all those consumed in the creation.														
834	6	5	Suit of the Solipsist	Suit of the Solipsist	The last suit you'll ever wear. -Shichou Liru Takes the form of a three-piece business suit. When a layer of the suit is damaged, the wearer's next physical attack will strike at all targets in eyesight provided the wearer could feasibly do so normally. Those witnessing the attack will see, for the briefest moment, numerous copies of the wearer apparently leaping out of the suit and performing these attacks before vanishing into thin air when the attack has finished. These copies are formed from the cloth of the suit itself and are paper thin, but still possess the stamina, strength, and speed of the wearer, much like a bunshin. All regular rules regarding attacking still apply. In addition, so long as the suit is not destroyed, the wearer feels no pain (though they will still take damage).

834	7	1	Poncho of the Prophet	Poncho of the Prophet	The future looks bleak. Do your best in the present! -Last Words of Shichou Berzachi of the Second Sight Takes the form of a long, body length poncho, usually with a hood. When activated all earth in a mile radius begins to tremor. If no storm is present, one will quickly form at the location of the wearer. Howling winds and bone shattering, fist sized hail will begin to fall, the earth turns to liquid mud, and any structures in the area of effect that aren't built to last will rapidly begin to disintegrate and sink under the apocalyptic fury of nature. Frequently causes sinkholes, landslides, and killer squalls. Lasts the entire thread, or until the wearer wills the storm to stop. While the wearer has no control over the storm itself, so long as they wear the poncho, they will not succumb to its effects.														
834	7	2	Shroud of the Saint	Shroud of the Saint	I'll see you in hell. At least it'll be warm down there. -Last words of sennin Shichou Wang Takes the form of an simple cloth robe, almost like a poncho. Any wound sustained by the wearer while the shroud is in one piece is likewise inflicted on the attacker. This has infinite range, so even remote traps, poison, or delayed effects will still mirror the injuries. Though the wearer might not die from the wounds, the originator of the attack can still succumb if the injury is great enough. If the wearer dies, the attacker also dies. The only way to avoid the injury mirroring is to destroy the shroud first.														
834	7	3	Kimono of the Kindred	Kimono of the Kindred	Even earth itself is not permitted to soil my masterpiece. -Last words of the scholar Shichou Karan Takes the form of an ornate, or plain, unisex kimono. When worn the wearer is granted the ability to use jutsu by thought alone, without hand seals. If permitted by another, the wearer may also use jutsu known by allies (but cannot remember or learn them after). Likewise the wearer can hover up to a meter off the ground and move around at their base speed stat (no bonuses). If no action is taken while wearing the kimono, the wearer will replenish one usage for each stage, for stages six and below. The wearer may also transfer one usage of their own of each stage six or below to an ally.														
834	7	4	Mask of the Many	Mask of the Many	What is a single thread compared to a tapestry? -Last known words of counselor Shichou Uryu Takes the form of a large piece of headgear which covers both head and face, usually very ornate but not necessarily. Typically seen at masquerade balls or performances. More than one mask can be created at a time, up 5, with all masks being identical. Activated by being worn willingly. All individuals wearing a mask become a fused personality, sharing emotions, memories, knowledge, and all sensory information. All mask wearers share their jutsu usages between each other, can use jutsu known by other other masks, can fight with tai styles known to other masks (no bonuses), communicate telepathically among each other, and can even share damage between themselves. All masks speak in a composite voice of the whole. If the mask is broken, the wearer leaves the shared personality. Lasts until the mask is destroyed or removed.														
834	7	5	Crown of the Commandant	Crown of the Commandant	Live with purpose. -Last words of the prime matriarch Shichou Koko Takes the form of heavily ornate headgear, usually small and metal but can be entirely cloth if desired. When worn the crown allows the wearer to stop and reverse ninjutsu stage five and below simply by pointing and willing the jutsu to turn on its creator (this consumes a stage equal to the reversed jutsu). When those wearing the crown speak, all listen, and those without strong wills of their own (like bunshin, chakra constructs, or disloyal summons) feel compelled to do as ordered. If the crown is removed without consent, the perpetrator's body will be overcoming by horrible, all encompassing pain until the crown is replaced, though no actual damage will be incurred.

833	1	1	Christening	Christening	Christening simply grants the user the ability to excrete karamushi eggs and larva through the skin. The effect is nearly unnoticeable to normal eyesight as the parasites appear to be small white particles. Without this skill the Maeda must rely on only their blood to spread their parasite. Infection is still only possible through introduction of the karamushi into a host's blood.														
833	1	2	Biofilm	Biofilm	Parasites emerge from the skin and wrap and tie together, forming a slimy, sticky cloth. The biofilm reduces the speed/mobility of anyone who walks on/touches it apart from the user. The karamushi die after two posts and then the lattice disintegrates. One cloak-sized portion of karamushi biofilm may be created. This technique may be used on any infected individual, in which case it takes two posts. In the first post the karamushi emerge from the skin of the host, at which point they can be scrubbed away or removed without much effort. If ignored, they form the film in the next post. Base Effect: Biofilm reduces speed by 1 level (can't reduce speed to 0) Stage Two: Biofilm regenerates if cut or damaged. Stage Three: Biofilm hardens at the end of its duration and requires stage three strength to break free from or one post.														
833	1	3	Crawling Skin	Crawling Skin	A slick lubricating chemical is excreted by the karamushi and onto the hosts skin. This lubrication prevents that body part from being grappled or held onto. This lubrication can also be thrown onto surfaces, rendering them slippery for one post. This may also be done on infected individuals. In the first post the target will begin to sweat excessively, then in the second they will produce the slippery oil making it difficult for them to hold onto or throw weapons unless some kind of material is between their skin and the object.														
833	1	4	Strain: Hemorrhage	Strain: Hemorrhage	Strains passively modify karamushi infections. The Maeda can switch between any strains they know freely when releasing karamushi from their body. An individual can only be colonized by one strain at a time. The hemorrhaging strain reduces clotting and induces bleeding from the host's orifices. The mouth, ears, nose, and eyes will all begin to release a large (but ultimately harmless) amount of blood. Slightly blurred vision and lightheadedness are common symptoms of this strain. The bleeding stops after two posts.

833	2	1	Blood Brother	Blood Brother	Any person infected with the user's strain of karamushi can be tracked (general direction is known) for up to three posts. Any person infected with the user's strain also spreads the contagion in his blood, however if they do so the user cannot tell which individual was the one they infected first.														
833	2	2	Water Contamination	Water Contamination	With a protective chakra coating, Karamushi can function as liquid born pathogens for a short time. Any liquid, body fluid (such as saliva), or liquid jutsu (such as oil, mud, acid, or water), can serve as a suitable vector. Any liquid that comes in contact with the Maeda can protect karamushi for up to three posts. NOTE: Does not work on mist or cloud based techniques. Only liquid is infectious.														
833	2	3	Egg Sack	Egg Sack	A chitinous orb erupts from the underside of a palm and is filled with blood and karamushi spawn. The orb is about the size of a tennis ball and explodes with the force of an explosive pouch when thrown. Tainted blood along with chitin shrapnel spread in all directions after detonation, causing minor lacerations and infecting anyone injured by the blast. Hiding behind cover or saying outside the small blast radius (about a three feet) will prevent any damage and infection. Base Effect: Exploding pouch force, one Egg Sack created Stage Three: Two Egg Sacks can be created (one in each hand) Stage Four: Exploding tag force, four Egg Sacks can be created (two in each hand)														
833	2	4	Strain: Hemophilia	Strain: Hemophilia	After infection, the karamushi swarm around the host's wounds and delay any healing techniques of equal stage to the highest stage of this tree the user knows. This also weakens the host, making their injuries hurt much more. The delay is one post (as in, any healing techniques used won't show an effect until the following post). Typical symptoms of the hemophilic strain are spontaneous bruising, aches, and pains. What form the pain takes is up to the target. Lasts three posts.

833	3	1	Boiled Alive	Boiled Alive	Hardened pockets of fluid resembling boils split out from under the hosts skin. When struck or at the Maeda's command, these boils burst open and spray karamushi laden liquid. The ejection of this blood mist obscures sight for a few moments after being expelled, functioning like an infectious smoke screen. This technique may be used on infected opponents, in which case it takes two posts, one for the formation of the boils, and the second for them to burst. The boils can be removed (excision), bandaged, healed, or covered before bursting to prevent damage.														
833	3	2	Fleshpound	Fleshpound	A bloody mass of writhing karamushi can be spat from the mouth. The blob of worms functions like an autonomous organism and can roll around at stage one speed. The Fleshpound can also form a protective cocoon out of chitin, resembling any object similar in size to itself (similar to a henge). When a warm target touches the Fleshpound, the worms will begin to swarm around the body looking for an opening into the host. They can be removed easily but only if time is taken to carefully do so. Fleshpounds last a maximum of 3 posts. Base Effect: Fleshpound is the size of a tennis ball. Stage Four: Two of the base effect Fleshpounds can be created, or 1 bowling ball sized one. Stage Five: Four of the base effect, two stage four sized, or one tire sized Fleshpound can be created.														
833	3	3	Gut Rot	Gut Rot	Intestinal karamushi generate noxious gas which can be expelled through the mouth. This substance functions like tear gas and is flammable. The gas is expelled only in a small area around the user, requiring close contact in order to be effective, but will remain in the air where expelled for two posts. This can be used on infected individuals, and takes two posts. In the first post the target will expel a noxious but harmless green smoke whenever they exhale, and in the next post the smoke becomes more potent and has full effect. Holding ones breath prevents the smoke from escaping. The host (whether Maeda or otherwise) is immune to the effects.														
833	3	4	Shambler	Shambler	Requires a fresh (killed within the thread) corpse (animal or human). Karamushi within a dead body take over the cellular machinery, catalysing and producing the necessary energy to give motion to the lifeless. These Shamblers have stage one strength, speed, and stamina and will only last three posts before the karamushi die. Shamblers are also infectious vectors of the parasite themselves. Shamblers seek out the warmth of new hosts like the karamushi and somehow can tell friend from foe. Shamblers rely on the structural cohesiveness of the body in order to operate, and will cease to function if two or more limbs (arms, legs, or head) are removed. Base Effect: Shambler is limited to the movement patterns of the original host. Stage Four: Shamblers gain dexterity and slimy skin allowing them to stick to and climb vertical surfaces Stage Five: Shamblers may create other Shamblers														
833	3	5	Strain: Emergent	Strain: Emergent	Symptoms of the emergent strain are stomach cramps, hot flashes, and tremors. This strain is wild and chaotic, sending the worms into a frenzy upon infecting an individual. Hosts are overtaken by local convulsions (typically in arms and legs) as the worms weave through their flesh. This does not render the host immobile or paralyzed or effect the host's strength or stamina, but does induce shivering, twitching, and trembling, often making it difficult to remain hidden or execute precise actions. Lasts two posts.

833	4	1	Bloat	Bloat	Masses of karamushi are forced through flesh and begin writhing beneath the skin. The host's flesh takes on a grotesque and lumpy form. The flesh itself is protected by the bodies of the parasite, softening blunt damage and making it difficult for attacks to pierce deeper than the skin. This technique effectively reduces the strength of blunt attacks by two levels and lowers the strength of all attacks the Maeda receives by one stage regardless. May be used on infected individuals. Lasts one post. Base Effect: Two stage reduction on blunt attacks, one stage strength reduction of all attacks Stage Five: Lasts indefinitely for up to two attacks.														
833	4	2	Spore	Spore	Karamushi eggs are expelled from the mouth in a massive cloud expanding from the user into a 15 foot radius. The cloud persists for two posts and is highly infectious if contact is made (indiscriminate of host, so this applies to allies in the cloud as well). This cloud is infectious by mere touch- if the any of the eggs end up in the eyes, the victim is immediately infected. If any of the smoke is inhaled the victims are likewise instantly infected. This technique also produces enough smoke to emulate a smoke grenade.														
833	4	3	Dire Worm	Dire Worm	After using this technique several large white 'worms' break out from under the skin, resembling maggots. These maggots are actually bundles of karamushi swarming around each other, sacrificing size and infectious potential for mobility. The maggots flail and thrash at a strength level of 2 and can either remain in the skin or drop off, where they will naturally seek the warmth of a host and then promptly crawl onto it and start it beating savagely. In addition each maggot can climb surfaces and may shoot off 1 jet of karamushi laden blood which is accurate for up to 15 feet. Each maggot is a foot long, and can act independently. They are also extremely weak and will fall apart if struck, and will fall apart regardless after two posts. May be used on infected individuals and takes two posts to completely form in this case, with the worms being weak enough in the first post to destroy without effort. When used on others the Dire Worm will remain embedded in the skin and will smack the host repeatedly until destroyed or removed. Base Effect: Eight maggots can be created Stage Five: Sixteen maggots can be created. Stage Six: Maggots reassemble if struck and can burrow into soft surfaces (soil, sand, other people).														
833	4	4	Life Fiber	Life Fiber	Thousands of thin mucus strings are ejected from the flesh of the host. These strings extend to a maximum of 35 feet and latch firmly onto whatever surface they collide with. The spray forms a three dimensional web, with each individual string weak but their combined strength enough to prove difficult to move through. The Maeda may travel through these strings with no trouble. This technique may be used on anyone who has been infected, and when done this way it confines the person inside the middle of the gooey net. Movement is still possible within the net if caught this way for one post, and thus the trapped host may escape through kawarimi or break through the strings. However after the first post running into the net will result in being entangled, slowing those caught. The mucus itself is corrosive and infectious and will burn (and infect) exposed flesh that it touches. Burning will cause skin lesions and open blisters but not go deep into the muscle. The web dries out and falls apart in three posts after creation.														
833	4	5	Strain: Hydrophobic	Strain: Hydrophobic	The hydrophobic strain over-stimulated the infected target's immune system causing body temperature to skyrocket and massive sweating. Dry heaving, fevered thoughts, and extreme weakness are common symptoms of this strain. This water loss is immediate and devastating, often leading to serious injury (through organ failure) or death if water (or any other liquid) is not consumed within the thread. Has been known to cause individuals to drink the blood of others in desperation. Karamushi die in the host after two posts and even the intake of water will not nullify the dehydration effects so long as the parasite remain within the host.														
833	4	6	Open Slot																
833	5	1	Nest	Nest	A gooey, warm, pulsating, sponge-like chitin structure soaked with infected blood grows and drops off the exposed flesh of the host. This Nest is then thrown or placed on any surface (the structure is sticky and will latch onto walls/people). The Nest is an incubator and over the course of a post it grows and swells, reaching the size of a beach ball and casting out fleshy red 'roots' around whatever surface it lands on. The Nest also produces an obscuring cloud of black spores and grows its roots in a 3 foot radius around it. Nests spit out a Dire Worm (base effect) every post, with the spore/root radius and number of Dire Worms produced doubling every post. At the users command (or when attacked) the Nest can explode, covering a huge radius (explosive tag in size, increasing in size by 1 tag each post) with eggs, adults, and chitin fragments. This obscures vision, shoots senbon-like fragments of chitin out in all directions, and coats the whole area in a thick layer of blood. Being in the radius of the blast virtually guarantees infection, as if any of the shrapnel pierces the skin or any of the bloody mist is inhaled the victim becomes infected. The nest will last for four posts if left unattended, gaining one post of duration if its roots happen to find and surround a dead or unconscious body, and can explode automatically at the end of its life or allowed to silently dissolve. Two post cooldown, and can only be used twice per thread.														
833	5	2	Oroboros	Oroboros	The Oroboros technique activates hibernating spores left behind in hosts who have been cured or purged of karamushi in the past, allowing for the reinfection of an individual. This technique effectively allows the Maeda to instantly reinfect any individual (including themselves) who they have infected once before, including whatever strain that karamushi carried initially. This can only be done once per person per thread. If more than one infection strain was present, the user may chose which is reactivated. A 'seal' version of this technique exists at higher levels, which can either confer complete immunity to further karamushi infection, or lock karamushi into an endless cycle of reinfection, but due to its complexity if can only be done outside of combat (requires Maeda Clan GM approval). 17 Tactics -Reactivation of infection can only be done once per thread 24 Tactics -Infection can be sealed outside of combat, either to prevent further infection or lock current infection permanently														
833	5	3	Fleshtide	Fleshtide	This technique grants two abilities, one passive and one active. Passively, anybody who dies with the Maeda's parasite within them will be converted over the course of a post into a Nest (and does not affect the Nest cooldown). The active (and hand seal requiring) part of this technique purges a target of their karamushi infection by forcing large numbers of chitinous eggs to fall from their skin, which will then rapidly reform into a Nest (unaffected by Nest cooldown). This technique has a three post cooldown for the active competent. Nests created this way cannot explode but retain all the other properties of Nests.														
833	5	4	Strain: Hypoxic	Strain: Hypoxic	Forces the parasite into the lungs, promoting an immune response that inflames the organ and causes shortness of breath and eventual suffocation. Typical symptoms of the hypoxic strain include heavy breathing, coughing blood, inability to talk or make vocalizations, and slowed reaction and movement times from oxygen deprivation. Weaker hosts (nonshinobi or untrained animals) will often faint from the infection alone. Karamushi die in the host after two posts.

833	6	1	Bane	Bane	The Maeda's skin becomes a writhing, fluid layer of worms. When something touches this living skin the worms burst forward and entangle and surround that object, protecting the user. In addition, if the worms are not killed quickly, the swarms of karamushi will attempt to surround and infect anything nearby. The entire skin is shed when a sufficiently large attack is stopped (either 25 strength or stage five Ninjutsu). If the attack is weaker and the worms reach living flesh, then the worms burrow into the skin, causing immense pain and possible infection. Lasts two posts or until destroyed.														
833	6	2	Bloodbath	Bloodbath	Fat, blood gorged worms are forced out of the body in droves from the hands and skin of the user. These worms erupt on contact with the air and drench the user in their own partially digested vital fluids. This has the effect of turning their body red, while also granting immense acidic properties to their skin by virtue of the karamushi's own digestive fluids. Though this corrosive property does not affect the shinobi or clothing they are wearing, most everything else they touch will dissolve from the blood they secrete. Weak materials (paper, cloth, skin) will dissolve in one post, whereas stronger materials (metal, muscle and bone, stone) can take up to three. The blood created by this technique will stick around for three posts, though the technique only lasts one. This blood is highly infectious and will simultaneously burn through exposed skin while infecting those it lands on. Two post cooldown.														
833	6	3	Complete Saturation	Complete Saturation	This technique requires a substantial amount of infected blood to be spilled onto the earth, either the Maeda's or any other infected hosts. Within a post the ground below erupts into millions of individual, foot long long chakra-enhanced karamushi worms, formed from the spilled blood. The effective area covered is equal to 20 feet in radius from where the blood made contact and the karamushi can spread outward from there in the direction of the Maeda's choosing, moving at a speed equal in stage to double the number of posts the blood has been soaking in the earth. The worms slow down the movement of anyone who sets foot on them by one speed stage per post, and will attempt to swarm up the legs of any organism in an attempt to force their way into a new host.														
833	6	4	Strain: Oncotic	Strain: Oncotic	The karamushi invade and multiply rapidly without care for the survival of the host. Swollen, karamushi filled tumors grow from beneath the skin those infected, making movement difficult. These tumors can grow to the size (and weight) of a watermelon, though they can be severed by the host prior to reaching full size. One tumor grows on the host per post, doubling each post for three posts. Each tumor reduces speed by one stage. Being reinfected lengthen the duration by one post.														
833	6	5	Lesion	Lesion	This technique can be used on any wounded person (however minor the wound) who is also infected. Karamushi erupt from underneath the wound and cause it to grow bigger and bleed more and more. Small cuts become large gashes, small puncture wounds enlarge to fist sized holes, and shredded or torn skin sloughs off like wet paper. This technique kills all the karamushi inside the host while simultaneously massively increasing the bleeding, making the host highly contagious for the one post duration while the karamushi are active.														
833	6	6	Open Slot																
833	7	1	Blight	Blight	Every karamushi in the area (100 feet radius) that does not belong to a Maeda immediately dies and disintegrates, releasing a lethal cocktail of chemicals and poisons. Karamushi on or within people will cause severe chemical burns, organ damage, and in severe cases, death. This technique also applies to any karamushi laden liquid, and is capable of turning bodies of contaminated water or blood into lethal pools of powerful acid. This acidity is retained for three posts. In order to use this technique on a person again, they must be reinfected.														
833	7	2	Legion	Legion	The Maeda calls forth to every karamushi in an area (100 feet radius) and forces them to rise and exit their hosts through the skin and/or mouth/eyes. The worms cause only superficial damage while leaving as they burst from the skin of the infected. The karamushi gather into a writhing, amorphous mass, roughly conical in shape with a radius and height of 6 feet and growing by 3 feet for every two infected bodies within the area. The tower of karamushi possesses a multitude of massive twenty foot long tentacles which it uses to pull itself around. This Legion seeks warmth and those grabbed by its limbs will find themselves being pulled towards the center of the mass and if they don't escape, assimilated into it. Stage seven strength or higher is needed to break free from the Legion's grasp. The Legion is impossible to destroy as it will just reform after being attacked, but it can be slowed down and delayed by destroying the limbs while they regenerate, as to preventing it from moving. The Legion falls apart in three posts, but will gain one more post of duration for every body it consumes. This technique purges all karamushi from the Maeda's own system, as well as from the system of every other non-Maeda person in the radius.														
833	7	3	Juggernaut	Juggernaut	So integrated are the parasites to the body of the host that the two cannot even truly be told apart. Even when the shinobi finds their reserves drained, their body broken, and their life fading away, the karamushi take action to keep their precious host alive. At the call of the shinobi (or whenever the user is in danger of death) thick ropes of karamushi spawn break through the skin and surround their limbs in a seething, living armor. Broken bones and torn muscle is bypassed entirely as the worms stitch the entire body together and give it new strength. Even ruptured organs can be bypassed entirely by the karamushi's efforts with beating, living, chitinous replicas serving as substitutes. From the outside it seems as though the shinobi has become a lumbering, festering, human shaped conglomerate of worms- on the inside the shinobi's body has been completely bypassed and converted by the karamushi. For three posts the user remains at peak physical condition, regardless of their state before activating the technique. At the end of the duration the karamushi, as always, die from exposure, leaving the shinobi's partially restored body behind. This is not true healing- rather, any wounded body parts have been replaced by extremely intricate karamushi replicas, which function like the replaced body parts would, but less efficiently. All stats are temporarily reduced by half at the end of this technique for the remainder of the thread, and are permanently reduced by 1. At this stage it is impossible to tell whom is exploiting whom, as repeated use of this technique inevitably replaces the human flesh into something indistinguishable from karamushi flesh. They have become a living, breathing karamushi progenitor. Can only be used once per thread.														
833	7	4	Strain: Necrosis	Strain: Necrosis	This strain of worms secrete a necrotic toxin that dissolves flesh into a tasty protein soup. Anyone infected by these karamushi will begin to have their internal organs liquified by the worms, causing hemorrhaging (bruises on the skin, eyes becoming red, skin tearing/hair loss), extreme pain, and complete organ failure (most often leading to death). However, this strain of the karamushi is so inherently unstable and unviable that they kill even themselves in the process. Therefore multiple reinfections are necessary to ensure death- two cycles will often do the trick, extremely few live through three, and after four the host's body typically collapses into an unidentifiable pile of gore. Lasts one post.

832	1	1	Proxy	Proxy	Allows the user to transfer one's own chakra to other targets via physical contact. This chakra piece may then be molded into a single Function. Can only successfully transfer if the target is willing or if user's Power is greater than target's Willpower. May only transfer to a single target once per post when in battle, no limit for fluff situations. Ninjutsu with their own stats, such as bunshins, will be treated as humans. Chakra-infused weapons or objects are treated as an extension of the human body, thus abiding to the same rule. Because of conflict in chakra, Proxy will fade from a living body after time if not used. The speed of fading is different between enemies and allies. Genin: Enemy - 1 posts/Ally - 2 posts Chuunin: Enemy - 2 posts/Ally - 3 posts Jounin: Enemy - 3 posts/Ally - 4 posts														
832	1	2	Function: Resonance	Function: Resonance	A technique that requires physical contact from user to be successful. The jutsu covers the target's body in imitation of Reisouhou, forcing them to feel the various chakra and handseal residues for one post. Though never painful or detrimental to the body, the sudden burst of sensory information can be distracting to say the least.														
832	1	3	Function: Immunity	Function: Immunity	A technique serving as the very basics of defense. User may inscribe this Function onto any item, such as paper, clothing or such, so they are resistant against accidental damage or against the elements such as rain or fires. This is only a protection against non-chakra damage and can't withstand attacks of any level. Useful when trekking through rainfall and keeping one's clothing and parchments dry, or if one is prone to clumsiness.														
832	1	4	Editing	Editing	Passive skill. Inserting a new Function into a technique is considered a single action, though the act costs two jutsu usage; the Function inserted and the jutsu it altered. Replacing any Functions in a technique uses the same cost; though removing them only costs the jutsu usage of the technique being Edited.

832	2	1	Hunt: Decipher	Hunt: Decipher	The active alternative of Reisouhou. While the bloodline grants the details of chakra passed, Decipher imitates the bloodline on a current time basis. The jutsu utilized on a willing body will analyse and relay the body's chakra status back to the user. Post duration is the equivalent of one's highest Stage in the bloodline, not the ninjutsu list. So Stage 6 of bloodline will grant this technique six posts duration. Stage 2: Grants user knowledge of the target's direction and distance from user. Stage 3: Grants user knowledge of handseals molded by the target. Stage 4: Grants user knowledge of chakra system health of the target and any foreign chakra intrusion. Aside from relaying the chakra information of the target, the technique can now turn the body into a substitute Enari. The user may now use sense the Rivers the target passes through with Stage 1 bloodline description. Stage 5: Target is now a Stage 2 bloodline substitute														
832	2	2	Function: Adhesive	Function: Adhesive	A new adaptation of an old skill. The user molds chakra in the same manner as they would with Tree/Wall Walking. But rather than restricting the chakra solely to the feet, one may grant any part of their body with the same sticking effect as the feet with Tree/Wall Walking. They may also pass this into inanimate objects. Allowing them to stick to most surfaces but water. The adhesive force on such objects is not strong; a single tug by a child can pull them off the surface. Left undisturbed, the objects will remain sticking until user ends the technique.														
832	2	3	Function: Motion	Function: Motion	Dictate a direction of motion to its subject. On inanimate objects it will propel them in the nominated direction with same force as a throw by ordinary civilian. On living targets, the technique's force will be the equivalent of sudden jerk of the body towards the direction.														
832	2	4	Function: Pain	Function: Pain	A rudimentary Function, it causes a sharp jolt of pain akin to being poked by something sharp.														
832	2	5	Function: Condense	Function: Condense	Ideal to trick conventional assumptions. Used on soft materials like paper, cloths, plastic containers or even shoe laces, the Function endows the object with greater density than it normally would. As such, the object would become harder and heavier than usual. The technique is incapable of taking damage or doing greater damage. Rather, its ideal use is distracting the enemy's attention enough for user to take the advantage.														
832	2	6	Function: Yield	Function: Yield	The opposite of Condense, the Function softens the hardness of its target. The subject takes on a spongier, rubbery texture, making its impact softer than it normally would.														
832	3	1	Function: Fuse	Function: Fuse	When Function is activated on the object, it binds the object to whatever its surface touches. If nothing is touching the object when the technique is used, the next thing that comes in contact will be stuck to the object. For example, if one uses this Function on a doorknob, the next person who touches said doorknob will find their hand stuck to it. Stage 3: Requires Stage 2 Strength to break the bind Stage 4: Requires Stage 3 Strength to break the bind Stage 5: Requires Stage 4 Strength to break the bind														
832	3	2	Function: Blind	Function: Blind	Renders the target blind. As it is a jutsu induced blindness, sight enhancing items or jutsu Stage 3 and below does nothing to aid the target.														
832	3	3	Function: Numb	Function: Numb	Once activated, an area of 10 cm around where the Function was placed will become numb. Is useful for hindering opponents when placed upon strategic body parts or alleviating pain of companions.														
832	3	4	Function: Intercept	Function: Intercept	May be placed on a weapon or item. Once activated, this technique disrupts the chakra signal between the object and its owner. As such, weapons or items with chakra-induced special abilities will have said ability blocked for one post, rendering it back to a normal weapon or item. Stage 3: Block for 1 post Stage 4: Block for 2 posts Stage 5: Block for 3 posts														
832	3	5	Function: Purify	Function: Purify	Forcefully remove status-esque effects (Blind, Deaf, Immobalize, Numb, etc) from the subject. May one remove chakra induced effects, not poison induced. Stage 3: May remove Stage 2 effects and restrictions. Stage 4: May remove Stage 3 effects and restrictions. Stage 5: May remove Stage 4 effects and restrictions.

832	4	1	Hunt: Multi-trail	Hunt: Multi-trail	There are times when one needs to be attentive of numerous locations at the same time. One imbues something, mostly a small weapon or inanimate object, with one's chakra that's set to respond to only certain people's Rivers. If said person is within five meters radius of the chakra imbued object, it will instant alert the user of the target's presence. Base: Imbue up to 2 objects Stage 5: Up to 3 objects Stage 6: Up to 4 objects Stage 7: Up to 5 objects														
832	4	2	Function: Relocate	Function: Relocate	Changes the location where a technique appears. One use an object bearing this Function as the release point. Rather than spitting the jutsu out from the mouth, one can have it burst out from a boulder infused with this Function. May only affect willing targets and their techniques.														
832	4	3	Function: Subdue	Function: Subdue	By touching with the technique targeted for one action, the user may decipher and nullify the Functions holding the technique in shape. This destroys the technique. Due to need of physical contact, this Function is rarely, if never used against offensive techniques, but rather area-wide ninjutsu, such as quagmires, haze, sinkholes and other supportive-defensive techniques. Stage 4: May deactivate ninjutsu Stage 3 and below Stage 5: May deactivate ninjutsu Stage 4 and below Stage 6: May deactivate ninjutsu Stage 5 and below														
832	4	4	Function: Stall	Function: Stall	Partner technique to Subdue, a technique that disrupts the chakra signal between ninjutsu and its master. Ninjutsu techniques that require the owner to consciously direct will no longer receive their commands for the duration of one post. The ninjutsu is not destroyed, rather deactivated for the post. Any post duration limit for the ninjutsu will not be consumed when subjected to this technique, though requirements to destroy them remain the same. The user must first successful use Proxy on the ninjutsu before using this technique. For ninjutsu which produce more than one entity, such as several bunshins, the user need only activate Proxy on any part of the ninjutsu to deactivate the entire technique. Stage 4: May deactivate ninjutsu Stage 3 and below Stage 5: May deactivate ninjutsu Stage 4 and below Stage 6: May deactivate ninjutsu Stage 5 and below

832	5	1	Function: Density	Function: Density	A strange Function that doubles the weight of its host. While the technique is physically harmless, it can prove fatal if used on an unsuspecting target.														
832	5	2	Function: Backup	Function: Backup	An improvement on Relocate. In addition to changing where the technique is ejected from, Backup is akin to a single use summon scroll in that it may contain a technique inside an object until it is required. For example, one may aid a medic seal Chiyute into pieces of paper, distribute to allies who don't have medical expertise. If such ally is injured, they may release their piece of paper with the same ease as any summoning scroll and be healed by the Chiyute contained inside the paper, without requirement of a medic beside them. User may only use Backup on voluntary techniques, may be released by anyone it's given to, and may only contain a single technique into one item at a time. Require Stage 1 ninjutsu usage to release and consumes one action. Cost of creating a Backup item is both the Stage 5 usage(cost of Function) and the Stage of the technique contained, consuming one action for each technique.														
832	5	3	Function: Shield	Function: Shield	Infuses the subject with a surge of chakra same as strong as Stage 5 defense.														
832	5	4	Function: Explode	Function: Explode	A Function that detonates with the same force as an explosive tag. Requires Opponent Permission or Death Enabled to be placed on the character.														
832	5	5	Function: Dispel	Function: Dispel	The Function expands outwards, forcing out and dispelling any chakra-based technique currently inhibiting the target's body. Does not work on Gates, Seals or Archetype Specials. May only work if the target's current Willpower is less than user's Power. Stage 5: May dispel techniques Stage 4 and below Stage 6: May dispel techniques Stage 5 and below Stage 7: May dispel techniques Stage 6 and below

832	6	2	Function: Retrieval	Function: Retrieval	A technique used exclusively to return allies to the user's side. Once activated, the subject will be enclosed in a chakra shield strong enough to break through stone or concrete as well as techniques Stage 5 and below as it pulls the ally back to the user's location. Maximum distance from user is 1 km. Can only be used out of direct combat with the maximum speed of retrieval the User's reserve stat.														
832	6	3	Function: Inhibition	Function: Inhibition	A movement Function that roots the subject to the ground for a maximum of two posts. They can still move, just that their feet can not lift off or slide across the floor. Those with base 20 Strength may break the bind with one action cost.														
832	6	4	Function: Contain	Function: Contain	A Function that, when activated, contains any damage and shock from impact or explosion of techniques within a chakra bubble. The Function may be in contact with the technique the user wishes to contain the damage of. The Function contains any outward shockwave, explosion, expansion, shrapnel shower and such damage created by the technique within a two meter diameter sphere. May only contain Stage 5 and below techniques.

Unlike other Proxy techniques, this one requires one post to accomplish. May only be used on willing targets. Target must be within range for 2 posts.														
832	7	2	Function: Beacon	Function: Beacon	A deadly technique that acts as a magnet for all ninjutsu. After the handseals, the user must touch the target desired. For two posts, every technique that's not created by the target will, regardless of original direction, be drawn to the target. May only attract techniques Stage 5 and below.

831	1	1	Ice Element: Special Snowflake	Hyouton: Dokuji Seppen	With a seal and an effort of will, the shinobi causes a single snowflake to materialize in their cupped palm. This snowflake has unique properties; it will retain its shape and form regardless of heat unless subjected to an open flame and can hold up to heavy pressure. The maker of this snowflake is always aware of vaguely where their special snowflake is in the same way that a compass always knows which way is north. It is thus most useful as a tracking technique. A shinobi may only have one special snowflake active at a time. Base: Snowflake melts one mile from user Stage Two: Ten miles Stage Three: As long as the shinobi wills it.														
831	1	2	Ice Element: Frozen Claw	Hyouton: Iteru Tsume	The user can cause ice to condense on one finger, forming a long, sharp instrument. It is, however, not particularly durable, making it not particularly useful in combat. Usually it is instead used to cut through soft objects in the same manner as a knife or a substitute for a lockpick. It can be sustained as long as the user wishes, but given the nature of the technique seals are impossible. Stage Two: The claw grows, becoming as long as the fingers themselves, and becomes as durable as kunai. Stage Three: Anywhere between one finger and all ten can be covered in icy claws.														
831	1	3	Ice Element: Tears of Memory	Hyouton: Kioko no Nanda	The user pictures an image or thought clearly in mind as they meditate. Molding their chakra just so, they cause a single tear to fall from their eye. This tear then freezes into a sphere of ice no bigger than a pinky tip that will not melt except when held to an open flame or broken by force. When swallowed, this tear will flood the mind of that person with the memories stored within. It is classically used as a clandestine method of sharing information and passing messages without giving any prying eyes a hint to what is being bandied about. Base: A few minutes of memory and/or concise communication. Stage Two: An hour of memory and/or detailed communication. Stage Three: A day of memory and/or exhaustive communication.														
831	1	4	Ice Element: Ward Against Cold	Hyouton: Shogai Ni Hanshite Kanbo	Unlike other Hyoutons, which seek to create cold and manipulate it to the user's whim, Ward Against Cold operates on the opposite principle. This is a series of techniques, treatments and daily meditations applied make ones own body resistant to the natural chills of the outside world, allowing them to operate in the dead of a winter storm without worrying about frostbite or freezing to death. This technique does not guard against other Hyoutons.

A flock of swallows made of ice crystalize out of the air and veer through the sky toward the target. Their wings are razor sharp and can cut like knives. Base: 6 Swallows Stage Three: Twelve Swallows Stage Four: Eighteen Swallows														
831	2	2	Ice Element: Spyglass	Hyouton: Nozoku	The user makes a square with their thumbs and index finger, framing the landscape in front of them. Ice forms between their fingers, forming a square of ice through which the user can peer. They are able to magnify any part of the 'frame' without losing detail for up to a mile away, as though they were standing right next to it. It is an excellent technique to use if one wishes to scout over long areas or simply get a closer look at something without getting too close. Stage 3: Ten Miles Stage 4: They may see perfectly at night and through all forms of natural weather Stage 5: They may see through one layer of cover.														
831	2	3	Ice Element: Zero Grip	Hyouton: Reinigiri	A useful technique for dodging or maneuvering around upon the battlefield. They are able to force chakra through their feet and instantly freeze the ground beneath it, using it as a method of propulsion, skating over the terrain at their regular speed. This jutsu can be used to turn corners more tightly or just travel in style.														
831	2	4	Ice Element: Frigid Veil	Hyouton: Rinrin Usuginu	An invaluable technique for shinobi who do not want to be found. After a short series of handseals the user slams their hands into the ground and ice coalesces around their body, leaving only a breathing hole open to the outside world. This ice is perfectly transparent, however it bends the light as it passed through, making it seem as though the user is not there at all. An observer that wanders close might find a slight disturbance in the air where the user sits, but from afar it is nearly foolproof. However while so hidden they cannot move for any reason save breathing. This technique can last as long as the user can bear it.

831	3	1	Ice Element: Snow Clone	Hyouton: Yuki Bunshin	The user molds snow into a convincing mimicry of themselves. While physically identical in most obvious ways it only has the intelligence to follow the most basic orders and retains no knowledge of taijutsu training (no bonuses) or functional chakra usage. The user may only summon one. When they are hit, they will collapse into a pile of writhing snow. But, in the following post, if the snow is not completely removed, two will reform where the first was destroyed. Depending on how skilled the user is, their clones can split one, two or even three times before the clones cannot get up again. Base Effect: Splits Once Stage Four: Splits Twice Stage Five: Splits Thrice														
831	3	2	Ice Element: Freezing Trap	Hyouton: Tsubetai Ashikase	The user slaps a sealing tag down on a surface and imbues it with their chakra and the kanji for 'ICE' appears on its surface. Should anyone touch this tag ice will immediately crawl up their body and encase them completely in ice. If they are not eventually removed from the ice, the encased person will pass out from lack of air. Base: Can only be broken by ninjutsu stage two or physical strength levels two and up. Stage Four: Can only be broken by stage/level three and up. Stage Five: Can only be broken by stage/level four and up.														
831	3	3	Ice Element: Hidden Spear	Hyouton: Hitoshirezu Yari	Ending a series of seals by clapping their hands together, the shinobi conjures a spear of ice above their head and sends it spiraling toward their opponent. The ice it is made of has no imperfections, making it perfectly transparent and difficult to see in the right light. Many an enemy of Snow has died from this technique and never realized what exactly killed them. Stage Four: Two Spears Stage Five: Three Spears														
831	3	4	Ice Element: Snow Buckler	Hyouton: Yuki Tate	A vital defense jutsu, when the user completes their seals snow begins to spiral around their dominant arm, forming a shield over it of ice and snow given form and function by this technique. This shield is large enough for the user to duck behind it entirely, curbing the influence of any jutsu that shield can ward away. The user may continue to keep this shield active, but it is an active drain on their chakra, burning through a jutsu usage every active post. Base: Protects Against Stage Two Ninjutsu and Level Two taijutsu Stage Four: Stage Three Ninjutsu, Level Three taijutsu Stage Five: Stage Four Ninjutsu, Level Four taijutsu														
831	3	5	Freezing Flock	Hyouton: Tsubetai Murasuzume	The user conjures five animated swallows in a manner similar to Tsubame Fubuki, and directs them to a target. Each swallow will immediately freeze when it impacts a target, partially encasing them in ice. Each swallow could individually, encase a limb, and if all of them hit true they could potentially freeze a target completely. They must travel as a group and can only make one turn, predetermined when this technique is used. This ice is specially reinforced, and can only be broken by a base strength level or stage two jutsu. Stage Four: Can only be broken by stage/level three and up. Stage Five: Can only be broken by stage/level four and up.

831	4	1	Ice Element: Snow Instantaneous Body	Hyouton: Yuki Shunshin	Clapping their hands together, the shinobi disappears in a swirl of spiraling snow. Almost immediately afterward, up to one mile away in a place that the user has been before, snow accumulates and the same happens in reverse. In combat this technique may only be used as an escape and no other action can be taken in that post. Stage Five: They may take up to four willing or restrained persons within arms reach with them.														
831	4	2	Ice Element: Cruel Winter's Mantle	Hyouton: Ooi no Hakujou Kanchuu	After a long series of seals the temperature around the user falls sharply, a thick coat of permafrost spreading five meters in every direction covering everything, freezing natural water solid. Allies and enemies alike are coated in a layer of ever-replenishing ice that lowers their speed level by two for as long as they remain there. If their speed level would fall to zero they instead freeze in place. This territory of cold follows the user for three posts, after which it must either end or be refreshed. Only those who have learned this jutsu are immune.														
831	4	3	Ice Element: Snowstorm	Hyouton: Fuusetsu	After a long series of seals the user calls snow from even the clearest of skies. It comes down in sheets, obscuring vision and laying a foot-deep cover over the ground in seconds before easing up into being merely hard to see through. Stepping through this snow makes movement terribly awkward, unless the shinobi in question knows Reinigiri. The snowstorm lasts for three posts. Stage Five: Four Posts Stage Six: Five Posts														
831	4	4	Ice Element: False Healing	Hyouton: Gimou Chiyu	While no replacement for proper medical care, a shinobi can make user of this technique to create a frozen simulacra of real flesh wherever theirs has been damaged, replacing muscle and tendon where the real thing was cut open and preventing hinderance from damage and death from bloodloss. This technique cannot replace vital organs, limbs or even digits, but it can act to mitigate the inconvenience of what could naturally be healed. When the user sleeps, the technique ends, requiring the user to seek medical attention or suffer the wound untreated.														
831	4	5	Ice Element: Raise Citadel	Hyouton: Ageru Nejiro	After a series of seals the user holds the image of a structure or fortress in their mind and slams their hand into the ground. Ice spreads and rises around them, building an unmelting structure out of ice and snow with properties mimicking that of everyday materials-whether it's mortar of slush, curtains of snowflakes or walls of ice, the shinobi can realistically use this technique to build fortresses and mansions out of ice and its derivatives in time. They can fill three cubic meters per post. Stage Five: They can fill five cubic meters per post.

831	5	1	Ice Element: Cold Steel	Hyouton: Samu Hagane	The name of this technique is something of a misnomer, as it can be applied to not only steel but weapons of any material, including the user's own hand. After they have run through the requisite handseals, they run their hand over the weapon in question, which promptly becomes encased in a frost and steams cold. This weapon will on contact with someone who does not know this technique cause instantaneous frostbite several inches deep with a cold that seeps through most kinds of armor. Base: Two Posts, One Weapon 24 Reserves: Three Posts 31 Reserves: Four Posts 23 Power: Two Weapons 30 Power: A multitude of weapons, such as projectiles														
831	5	2	Ice Element: Ice Clone	Hyouton: Kori Bunshin	With this jutsu at their disposal the user can fashion an automaton of hard ice that seems human only in deep shadow or at a great distance. Like the Snow Clone, it is identical to the user physically and can follow simple orders. But where the Snow Clone multiplies the Ice Clone is incredibly resilient and will retain its animating force even after parts of its body are shattered, though these broken pieces will remain broken. It can only be completely stopped by destroying its head. Base: No Tai Bonus, One Clone 24 Willpower: Ã‚Â½ Tai Bonus 31 Willpower: Full tai bonus but only one clone 23 Intelligence: Two Clones 30 Intelligence: Three Clones														
831	5	3	Ice Element: Embrace Stillness	Hyouton: Houyou Chinsei	Normally used by shinobi that are on the brink of death or wish for a great deal of time to pass, when the Yuki-nin uses Houyou Chinsei ice forms around them in a rough sphere, encasing them inside. Their heartbeat and bodily processes slow to a halt while the jutsu preserves their mind and the integrity of their body for a time they determine before making use of the jutsu. It is sometimes the only way to make certain that one will be able to survive to get medical attention or until help will arrive. The ice can be fractured by stage four and higher jutsu, ending the technique's effects early.														
831	5	4	Ice Element: Storm	Hyouton: Boufuu	By focusing a fair amount of chakra into the atmosphere while moving their hands through seals the user may conjure a swirling breeze of snow that quickly intensifies in a five-meter area. In addition to obscuring everything more than a hand from those trapped inside, the storm is full of ice as hard and sharp as steel that swirls and bites into the flesh of anyone who lingers there too long, leaving anyone who elects to remain without protection little more than shredded pieces of a person. This storm lingers for up to three posts after the initial use of the jutsu before it fades away. A user can only have one storm active at any given time.														
831	5	5	Ice Element: Snowball Barrage	Hyouton: Yukitama Renda	After a long series of seals, hyperdense snowballs begin to appear over the user's shoulders, suspended in midair. With a point of their finger the user propels dozens of snowballs toward the target; on impact they detonate, spreading a hypercool liquid that freezes into ice almost immediately around a yard in radius. If successful, after this technique is used the battlefield is littered with transparent spheres of ice.

831	6	1	Ice Element: Engulfing Sphere	Hyouton: Nomu Kyuutai	The user conjures a ball of raw, cold power hovering over their hand, and may toss it anywhere they will as they might a ball. On contact with any solid surface ice expands out from the point of impact with a crash like a surging glacier, swallowing up everything within a ten meter radius in a jagged prison of ice.														
831	6	2	Ice Element: Shatter	Hyouton: Wareru	This technique is designed to crack and detonate ice the user has created. It serves the dual purpose of turning iced-over parts of the battlefield into a minefield and delivering a finishing move to anybody encased in ice. With a seal and an effort of will the shinobi can cause any piece of ice they see to glow blue for a moment, crack and explode, damaging those nearby and tearing those trapped inside apart. They must focus on a small area of ice that they can see not exceeding a cubic meter per use of the jutsu, making its use on large groups of scattered enemies ill-advised.														
831	6	3	Ice Element: Ogre Make	Hyouton: Oni Sakusei	The shinobi accumulates their chakra in a sealing tag and uses it as a catalyst to begin the technique. When they slap the tag on a surface, snow and ice begins to gather quickly forming the body of an artificial devil with a sealing tag frozen to its face. It is several meters tall; possess two feet, long arms with razor claws that scratch against the ground and mouth of needle-like teeth. If the sealing tag is torn from its face it loses all animating force, but until then it will regenerate all damage done and follow the orders of its creator like the mindless brute it is. Due to strain the animation of such a creature puts on the user's body it may only be created once a day.														
831	6	4	Ice Element: Call Comet	Hyouton: Yobidasu Suisei	By creating a large amount of snow high up in the sky and compacting it to a fine point they create terribly dense balls of ice the size of a boulder eight feet across. The chakra that is used to compact the comet itself circles around inside of ball and explodes outward, scattering deadly icy shrapnel around the immediate area. These comets can be aimed at any place that the user can see and detonate on impact. Base: One Comet 30 Willpower: Two Comets

831	7	1	Ice Element: Transfiguration	Hyouton: Henbou	To initiate this jutsu, the shinobi must touch the target after flashing a number of seals. The target begins to, over the course of the next post, turn from flesh and blood into a pristine and transparent unmelting ice sculpture. This was dead Yukigakure's favorite method of dealing with prisoners and traitors alike, as when necessary another shinobi with this technique could reapply it to reverse the effect.														
831	7	2	Ice Element: Seize The Land	Hyouton: Nigiru Daichi	The user creates a shrine centered on a stone with four tags attached, each one pointing in a different cardinal direction. After a day of meditation careful application of their chakra they cast a spell over the surrounding ten miles, locking it in an eternal winter in the likeness of Snow country regardless of where the shrine is erected. They can elect to give or withhold resistance to the cold to visitors, allowing allies easy transit while enemies must deal with the cold. The ice and snow blocks out all supernatural attempts to find those locked inside, with no exceptions. The spell can be broken by destroying the shrine at the center, returning the land to its natural climate and removing the masking influence of the jutsu.														
831	7	3	Ice Element: Frost Dragon's Breath	Hyouton: Kokyu no Hiryu	The user flies through a series of handseals ending in 'dragon,' and breathe out a rush of deadly cold air flecked with snow. The chill of this air is enough to make trees crack open and water freeze instantly; if it comes in contact with living creatures they freeze in all places touched from bone to marrow near instantaneously. The breath emerges from the user's mouth and continues outward in a wide cone large enough to cover a house completely before dissipating.														
831	7	4	Ice Element: Flash Frozen	Hyouton: Kyusoku Reito	Performed with just a single, one-handed seal, this emergency technique instantly freezes the air around the user. This shell of black ice forms a protective barrier, shielding the user from virtually every attack. The ice withstands ninjutsu stage six or lower and is impervious to any level of physical attack. The shield lasts for a single post before shattering and melting, freeing the user in the process.
